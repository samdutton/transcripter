[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.412 --> 00:00:07.437
GREG WHITWORTH: How's
everybody doing?

00:00:07.437 --> 00:00:07.937
[CHEERING]

00:00:07.937 --> 00:00:09.190
Wow, that's lackluster.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.210
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Thanks
for being here today.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.080
I'm Nicole Sullivan.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.645
I'm a PM for Google Chrome.

00:00:13.645 --> 00:00:15.270
GREG WHITWORTH: And
I'm Greg Whitworth.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.437
I'm a PM for Microsoft Edge,
and my Twitter handle's

00:00:17.437 --> 00:00:18.062
@GregWhitworth.

00:00:18.062 --> 00:00:20.050
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Yeah,
and I'm @stubbornella.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.480
That is, believe it or
not, actually the best way

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.820
to get hold of me.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.270
OK, so let's start off by
going back in time a bit.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.780
Do you remember when we were
going to get new HTML elements?

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.000
Who remembers that?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.130
I was super excited.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.680
After years of building
the same tab set again

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.740
and again and again,
I thought, huzzah!

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.820
This is it.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.450
Surely they'll see that this
is in every design system ever,

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.950
and they'll build
it into the browser

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.440
Then imagine my disappointment
when we actually

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.600
got a side article and section.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.962
They're totally fine.

00:00:55.962 --> 00:00:57.420
They just didn't
solve the problems

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.640
that I was trying to solve.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.610
So since then, I've held
onto the core belief

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.410
that HTML shouldn't be finished.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.600
Design systems have been
innovating and lighting

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.140
the path forward for HTML for
a long time, and I think now,

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.160
browsers can pave
those cow paths.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.460
GREG WHITWORTH: And at
Microsoft, we completely agree.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.543
On the move from Edge
HTML over to Chromium,

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:19.960
we did a full inventory of
some of the goodness we thought

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.687
was in HTML and wanted to
bring over to Chromium.

00:01:22.687 --> 00:01:24.770
We reached out to our good
friends over at Google,

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.440
and they completely
agreed, because one

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.898
of the things we wanted to look
into that we'll be covering

00:01:28.898 --> 00:01:29.790
is form controls.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.920
And starting up, we were
with accessibility, touch,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.870
and ultimately a
fresh coat of paint,

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.412
because when we were
looking at them,

00:01:36.412 --> 00:01:38.250
they were pretty
dated, as you'll see.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.300
We'll also be
covering stylability,

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.400
extending functionality,
and then ultimately,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.103
as Nicole was saying,
new components.

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:45.020
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Yeah.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.418
And bye-bye 1990s gradients.

00:01:51.418 --> 00:01:54.020
GREG WHITWORTH:
So as I noted, we

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.490
wanted to have the first
run on accessibility.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.380
And as we were
going through them,

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.708
we also noted there was a
huge need for look and feel.

00:02:00.708 --> 00:02:02.750
So we decided to go ahead
and tackle both of them

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.792
and update the look and
feel, and they're planned

00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:07.910
for both Mac and Windows.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.000
NICOLE SULLIVAN: So
we specifically wanted

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.420
the form elements to look
like part of a matched set.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.320
We were going for beautiful,
webby, and neutral.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.410
We hope that every design system
would see a bit of themselves

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.720
in the new designs
and easily imagine

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.600
how they might be adapted
for their own branding.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.160
The progress bar was not so bad.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.090
It's a little further along than
the others and a little newer.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.340
And so we took it
as a starting point

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.180
to move all of the other form
controls into the future.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.980
So if the progress bar
had set the standard,

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.080
the meter needed an upgrade.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.673
Super ugly.

00:02:47.673 --> 00:02:49.590
We're still working out
the last little tweaks

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.630
to get the strokes
exactly right,

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.180
but you can check it out on
Canary and give us feedback.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.320
This is the before, and on the
right-hand side is the after.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.210
You'll need to enable the Web
Platform Controls updated UI

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.570
flag to see the latest
in about://flags.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.450
GREG WHITWORTH: And then we
have this lovely Windows 95

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.077
draggable element here in the
range, which is definitely

00:03:17.077 --> 00:03:18.160
in the need of an upgrade.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.400
So we gave it a
more modern splash

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.770
coat of paints to flatten
it up a little bit.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.845
So hopefully it looks a
lot better to you as well.

00:03:25.845 --> 00:03:28.405
NICOLE SULLIVAN:
And for Chrome, we

00:03:28.405 --> 00:03:30.030
decided to experiment
with a little bit

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.010
of a different visual detail.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.475
We were showing the selected
portion of the range in color.

00:03:34.475 --> 00:03:35.850
We'd love to know
what you think.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.130
This is something we're
still playing with and trying

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.680
to figure out what works well.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.810
GREG WHITWORTH: And
check box and radio--

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.810
they're small, but they're also
really, really impactful form

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:48.310
controls.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.080
They're on almost
all of our forms.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.820
And while, again,
they're subtle changes,

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.850
those gradients are very,
very indicative of the year

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:55.717
that they came out.

00:03:55.717 --> 00:03:57.550
And we've now flattened
and modernized them,

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.967
and hopefully they fit better
in all of your form controls

00:03:59.967 --> 00:04:02.760
on your websites
that you're making.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.100
NICOLE SULLIVAN: I believe that
you lit the path for us here.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.330
Thank you.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.190
On Chrome, again, we
decided to experiment

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.620
with color for the
selected state.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.530
So that said, though,
we share about 99%

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.120
of the code for these elements.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.328
And so that's going to make
the next steps that we're

00:04:18.328 --> 00:04:21.602
talking about a lot easier.

00:04:21.602 --> 00:04:23.310
GREG WHITWORTH: Another
important aspect,

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.098
as we started off with,
was accessibility.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:26.640
And one of these
things is, it really

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.848
doesn't matter about the
input modality you're using.

00:04:28.848 --> 00:04:31.035
You should be able to use
the control in a good way.

00:04:31.035 --> 00:04:32.410
And touch is one
of those things.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.660
As you all know, I've been using
the Macs over at the booth,

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.600
and I keep touching the touch
screen that isn't there.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.350
We have the 2-in-1
Windows devices,

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.960
and so touch is very
important to us.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.790
And so we increased the hit
test regions on-- here's date.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.290
But the thing, the control I
think that shows this the most,

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.010
is the time element,
which as you can see here

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.510
is the current Chromium one
with those wonderful little tiny

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.340
spinners that, good
luck trying to touch

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.970
those with your fingers.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.750
We now have the similar pop-up
that we have within date,

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.820
and you've got the
normal touch scroll,

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.180
carousel-type feel to have
a good user experience.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.160
NICOLE SULLIVAN: I mean,
honestly, yeah, right?

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.540
Isn't that so good?

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.138
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:13.138 --> 00:05:15.180
I mean, I think that those
spinners were actually

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.805
pretty hard to click
with a mouse, too.

00:05:16.805 --> 00:05:18.540
I'd be like, oops,
no, I made it go down.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.270
GREG WHITWORTH: Same here.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.172
So to carry on the
accessibility notion,

00:05:26.172 --> 00:05:28.380
I love this graphic, because
we really try to make it

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.480
so that we're inclusive
design from the start.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.947
Our friends at Google feel
the exact same way, because

00:05:32.947 --> 00:05:35.280
of the fact that it doesn't
matter whether you're blind,

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.215
you're driving a car, you're
only able to use one arm,

00:05:38.215 --> 00:05:39.840
you're holding a
baby, a cup of coffee,

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.240
you're, using a mouse,
keyboard, touch, or pen.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.330
Everyone benefits from
making your stuff inclusive.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.220
One aspect of
great accessibility

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.480
is keyboard accessibility.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.090
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Yeah, and the
previous Chromium color picker

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.750
didn't have keyboard access
to all parts of the control.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.855
In particular, the color
well wasn't accessible.

00:05:58.855 --> 00:06:00.230
GREG WHITWORTH:
And this one here

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.680
is showing the
beautiful Windows--

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.610
NICOLE SULLIVAN:
Isn't it pretty?

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:03.950
GREG WHITWORTH:
--color control here,

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.783
but it's also the
keyboard navigation thing.

00:06:05.783 --> 00:06:08.762
It's actually true, also, of
the Apple-native one as well.

00:06:08.762 --> 00:06:10.970
But we went ahead and did
all of the keyboard support

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.630
that any user would expect.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.540
So if you're navigating
this with a keyboard,

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.800
everything works,
including the color well.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.070
And we also have
keyboard modifier keys

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.270
that use Control or Command.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.940
You jump 10 color
values, so that you also

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.153
get the same speed
and intuitiveness

00:06:25.153 --> 00:06:27.320
that you would with a mouse,
rather than just having

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.237
to go every single pixel
value, which would be

00:06:29.237 --> 00:06:30.590
really annoying and monotonous.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.550
NICOLE SULLIVAN: And this
is the kind of thought

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.530
that Greg's team really
puts into these things,

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.300
because it would be
super annoying to have

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.970
to go color by color
by color by a keyboard.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:43.170
And so being able to make
that 10-pixel jump is great.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.480
GREG WHITWORTH: So Edge also
had high-contrast support.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.820
It's something we value.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.402
And one misnomer, also, is,
it's called high-contrast,

00:06:49.402 --> 00:06:51.360
but it's actually a color
theme a user can set,

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.193
because people actually
do set low contrasts

00:06:53.193 --> 00:06:54.503
as well in different scenarios.

00:06:54.503 --> 00:06:55.920
But here, we're
showing that these

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.080
now in Chromium work
by default. Here's

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.830
a few of them, working
in high-contrast mode.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.370
And we went ahead and
brought this into Chromium.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.370
And then also, to give you
all better control of this,

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.580
because at times you
all have better context,

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.545
we went about doing
the standards work.

00:07:13.545 --> 00:07:15.420
And this is now behind
a flag in any Chromium

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.928
browser, forced-colors.

00:07:16.928 --> 00:07:19.470
And that lets you know-- this
is similar to the MS prefix one

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:20.845
we had in Edge,
but this lets you

00:07:20.845 --> 00:07:23.430
know when somebody is in this
state, whether it's active

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.300
or not.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.770
Because ultimately, you do
have more context than we do.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.520
And while the defaults are
great in probably 99.9%

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.550
of the scenarios that
we've seen across the web,

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:33.828
you also have more context.

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:35.370
So you can go ahead
and turn this off

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.380
and provide better scenarios.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.900
And the old-- does everybody
remember system colors from way

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.210
back in the day?

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.760
CSS system colors, like Windows?

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.540
OK, cool.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.750
A few of us.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.580
So those are actually
being brought back,

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.080
and some are being added in,
because those system colors are

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.620
now being adjusted so
that you can use them

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.180
in here to provide,
again, a better

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.472
experience for your users in
the context that you have.

00:07:56.472 --> 00:08:00.745
But also, understand they
work great out of the box.

00:08:00.745 --> 00:08:02.950
NICOLE SULLIVAN: I would
like to just take a moment

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.710
and acknowledge that the
Edge engineers have landed

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:08.500
36 commits in the
core of Chromium

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.930
that improves the accessibility
of the form controls.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.237
GREG WHITWORTH: Hats off to
the team back in Redmond.

00:08:16.237 --> 00:08:18.570
NICOLE SULLIVAN: This is going
to make a real difference

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:21.750
to users every day and make
it easier for web developers

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:25.522
to build things that
everybody can use.

00:08:25.522 --> 00:08:27.473
GREG WHITWORTH: So
the next phase--

00:08:27.473 --> 00:08:29.890
I'm sure none of you have ever
had any issues with styling

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.020
form controls-- is stylability.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.990
And so we wanted
to dig into this,

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.490
because as we were
working on this,

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.650
we noticed the users
could be [INAUDIBLE],,

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:40.770
and we kind of want
to understand that.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.280
So we wanted to
look at stylability,

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.780
and we wanted to
potentially make it

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.740
so you can style the dumb
things without hacks.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.690
So ultimately, this is
what it comes down to--

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.890
and hopefully you heard
in Yoav and Chris's talk--

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.080
that we want to
build stuff you use.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.570
We don't spend all these
days doing this stuff for you

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.220
all to throw it all away.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.650
And currently, form elements
are not used nearly as much

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:03.522
as they could be.

00:09:03.522 --> 00:09:04.980
And so we wanted
to understand why,

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.950
so we started doing customer
interviews and research.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.710
I love this quote
from a web developer.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:13.773
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Love
and slash hate, right?

00:09:13.773 --> 00:09:14.690
It's sort of horrible.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:15.840
GREG WHITWORTH: For sure.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.570
Now, it's also noted,
when we do prioritization,

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.780
it's important to
look for emotion.

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.370
And I actually got
a lot of comments

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.430
that I can't put on the screen
that show how terrible--

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:28.952
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Turns out
y'all hate form elements.

00:09:28.952 --> 00:09:30.180
GREG WHITWORTH: Just a tad.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.340
But anyways, it says, right
now it is often easier

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:33.990
to build form
controls from scratch

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.200
than it is to modify the style
of the controls themselves,

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.120
which ultimately
is just terrible.

00:09:42.006 --> 00:09:44.260
NICOLE SULLIVAN: So why not
just create form elements

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.928
from scratch?

00:09:45.928 --> 00:09:47.470
Do you know how many
times I've built

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.240
that tab set in my career?

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.380
I couldn't even count.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.052
That work was duplicated
over and over and over again

00:09:53.052 --> 00:09:54.010
in different companies.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:55.630
And even within a
company, there would

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:58.618
be separate design systems.

00:09:58.618 --> 00:10:00.442
GREG WHITWORTH:
Too many to count.

00:10:00.442 --> 00:10:02.040
NICOLE SULLIVAN: How many
did you find at Microsoft?

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:02.965
GREG WHITWORTH: So far, seven.

00:10:02.965 --> 00:10:03.550
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Seven.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:03.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:04.898
GREG WHITWORTH: So far.

00:10:04.898 --> 00:10:07.570
NICOLE SULLIVAN: And that's
just internal to Microsoft.

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:13.150
So even when you manage to get
a tab set or form control that

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.120
works really well, they often
have an uncanny valley feel,

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.520
where they match the operating
system in the browser

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.895
that you're most
comfortable with

00:10:19.895 --> 00:10:22.955
and feel just a little
bit off everywhere else.

00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:25.330
There's also something that
happens around accessibility,

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.730
where you try, and
you do your best,

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:30.400
and you add the ARIA roles,
but will every developer

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.694
that comes after remember
to add that ARIA role?

00:10:34.694 --> 00:10:35.820
GREG WHITWORTH: So, OK.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.450
This is audience
participation time.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.340
So we're going to just do a
quick survey to kind of just

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.600
get a feel for the room.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.100
So everybody put a
hand up in the air.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:45.718
Oh, come on.

00:10:45.718 --> 00:10:46.760
Put a hand up in the air.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:47.260
Thank you.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.110
I was going to say.

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:49.902
I was like, this will
be quick if everybody

00:10:49.902 --> 00:10:50.830
keeps their hand up.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:52.875
So when I say-- basically,
it's true or false.

00:10:52.875 --> 00:10:54.750
When I say something
that is not true for you

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.330
in your day-to-day web
projects, put your hand down

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:58.620
and keep it down.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.620
So you test your
website with a mouse.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.820
OK, that's good.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.423
You test in more
than one browser.

00:11:05.423 --> 00:11:06.090
All right, cool.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.030
I'm glad hands stayed
up for that one.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.693
You test on more than
one operating system.

00:11:10.693 --> 00:11:12.110
OK, that's kind
of what I figured.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.160
I appreciate the honesty.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.560
Truly, I appreciate the honesty.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.895
You test on more than
one operating system

00:11:17.895 --> 00:11:20.270
and in more than one browser
on those different operating

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:21.500
systems.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.300
OK, I appreciate
the honesty still.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:27.210
OK, so you test touch.

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:27.710
You do--

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:28.500
NICOLE SULLIVAN: That was a lot.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.180
That was a lot.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.280
I wasn't expecting touch to
be the one that got everybody.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.150
GREG WHITWORTH: This
is why this is great.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.500
Sorry for everybody that
still has your hands up

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:34.080
that we're talking.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.270
Your arms are getting tired.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:36.100
You test touch.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.100
We already did that one.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.320
You do accessibility testing.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.370
OK.

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:44.400
You do accessibility
testing in Chrome.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.240
Accessibility
testing in Firefox.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.930
Accessibility testing in Safari.

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:54.245
Accessibility testing of
Edge, Samsung Internet?

00:11:54.245 --> 00:11:56.852
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:56.852 --> 00:11:59.185
NICOLE SULLIVAN: There was
that one person out there who

00:11:59.185 --> 00:12:00.360
had their hand up until that.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.693
GREG WHITWORTH: I still have
six more questions, though.

00:12:02.693 --> 00:12:04.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.660
So I'll just rattle
them through,

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:06.910
but you kind of get the point.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.710
But did you test
Windows high-contrast?

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.090
Did you test keyboard?

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:12.250
Did you test assistive
technologies?

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.570
And then I even get into the
specific ATs that we all--

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:15.300
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Oh,
say them, at least.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.620
GREG WHITWORTH: OK, so
voiceover, NVDA, JAWS,

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.280
narrator.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.780
NICOLE SULLIVAN:
So by [INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.240
GREG WHITWORTH: The testing
matrix is massive here.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.710
And then that's
kind of the point,

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.650
ultimately, I'm trying
to get across is,

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:28.747
I actually don't fault
you, all of you that

00:12:28.747 --> 00:12:29.580
put your hands down.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.390
Personally, I feel
like this is our fault.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.370
We enabled this bad thing.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:36.040
Because you want to
style a slight element,

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.710
you go rebuild it all, and then
understandably can't-- you have

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:40.270
engineering realities,
just as we do,

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:42.730
and you can't put in
the time that we do.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:45.340
And then in addition to that,
I listed all those ATs--

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.290
we have great
relationships with them.

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:49.553
So when we find
issues in those ATs,

00:12:49.553 --> 00:12:51.595
or if they find issues
with us, we talk about it,

00:12:51.595 --> 00:12:52.265
and we fix it.

00:12:52.265 --> 00:12:54.640
And unfortunately, that's just
not something that scales.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.807
So ultimately, we wanted
to try to fix this problem.

00:12:59.348 --> 00:13:01.140
NICOLE SULLIVAN: So we
wanted to understand

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.500
why form elements are recreated
as sort of a starting point

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:08.860
for understanding what
we could do differently.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:13.210
The top 10 form controls that
are recreated by web developers

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:14.330
are here on the screen.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:15.250
The top one is Select.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:16.630
GREG WHITWORTH: Shocker!

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:19.180
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Yeah, I think
we all saw that one coming.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:23.290
Check box, date, radio,
and file, and then

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:27.072
a few others that
are used as well.

00:13:27.072 --> 00:13:28.780
So then obviously, we
asked the question,

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.900
why did developers
recreate the form controls?

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.450
And you really couldn't
have been more clear.

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:37.900
36.6% of you are
recreating form controls

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.750
just because you want
to change the style.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.690
And I think we both see
that as a huge opportunity

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:47.080
to give you something
that you need.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:52.180
Another 31.6% are doing it in
order to add functionality.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:56.080
And then 27.3% percent
are doing it to overcome

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.860
browser inconsistencies.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.484
So we feel like there's a
lot we can help with there.

00:14:01.484 --> 00:14:04.465
GREG WHITWORTH: So we heard you.

00:14:04.465 --> 00:14:06.840
Honestly, I think it's something
we've all kind of known.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:11.037
But ultimately, styling a
form control sucks on the web.

00:14:11.037 --> 00:14:12.870
So we're going to start
focusing and digging

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.300
into the select first,
then check box, radio,

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:19.046
and those other top controls
that we referenced earlier.

00:14:19.046 --> 00:14:21.880
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Can you imagine
being able to style the select?

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.943
How good would that be?

00:14:22.943 --> 00:14:23.860
That would be amazing.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.875
GREG WHITWORTH:
I can imagine it.

00:14:26.875 --> 00:14:29.590
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Then we'll talk
about extending functionality

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:32.190
of these elements.

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:35.600
So normalized values are
really painful for frameworks.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.450
We got a bunch of code pens
from the React DOM team.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:41.150
It turns out that 3
dot is not equal to 3.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.940
And so when the browser
normalizes those values,

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.940
often, something
is lost in the mix.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.760
And so we started looking into
raw value and other solutions

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.040
for preserving the
characters typed by the user.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.850
We want controls to also
work for frameworks.

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.200
I don't think we have
the end solution there,

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.240
but we're looking at it.

00:15:01.843 --> 00:15:03.760
We also asked you which
form elements give you

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.680
the most frustration.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.160
And you really couldn't
have been more clear.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.470
You kind of hate
the select element.

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.450
You hate it!

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:17.230
42.7% are the most frustrated
with the select control.

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:19.900
Let's just see-- how many
people here would put select

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.730
at the top of their list?

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:22.230
Yep.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:23.950
GREG WHITWORTH: It feels like,
actually, a little bit higher

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:24.450
than 40%.

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:26.050
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Yeah, it does.

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:27.040
Thank you.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.668
GREG WHITWORTH:
We'll update that.

00:15:29.668 --> 00:15:31.370
NICOLE SULLIVAN: And
the date picker--

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:32.995
you don't like the
date picker, either.

00:15:32.995 --> 00:15:36.140
That's 17.3% of folks.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:40.030
And file is another
popular one, at 9.3%.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:43.712
And finally, check box
and radio elements.

00:15:43.712 --> 00:15:45.670
GREG WHITWORTH: So
since the select

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:49.123
was by far the winner
of being the worst,

00:15:49.123 --> 00:15:50.290
we decided to dig into that.

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:52.440
We did another survey that had
a bunch of different questions

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.523
that started digging into
use cases and everything

00:15:54.523 --> 00:15:55.440
about the select.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.390
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Greg's team
will do surveys about select.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:15:59.020
Just select.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:15:59.930
It's kind of amazing.

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:02.263
GREG WHITWORTH: It's very
useful, because ultimately, we

00:16:02.263 --> 00:16:04.347
ended up having a bunch
of questions that ended up

00:16:04.347 --> 00:16:05.470
in these various buckets.

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:08.470
And so overwhelmingly, styling
is the largest pain point

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:10.950
that we should go try to
tackle first, then behavior

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:12.800
and extensibility and
content adjustments.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.680
One aspect I would like
to call out-- again,

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.847
why we had the individual
questions, because earlier

00:16:16.847 --> 00:16:19.097
we were talking about, oh,
do you want to extend them?

00:16:19.097 --> 00:16:20.347
And a lot of people said that.

00:16:20.347 --> 00:16:22.055
But when we were
digging into the select,

00:16:22.055 --> 00:16:23.950
because each control
has a different meaning

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:27.070
of extensibility, the
select-- the number one,

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.230
if you take out just the
top issue that people

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:31.300
had in this bucket,
which is being

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.610
able to provide a good user
experience while searching

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:37.018
the select, if you take that
out, this is nonexistent.

00:16:37.018 --> 00:16:38.560
It doesn't even show
up on the chart.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.980
So to me, that is the thing
that we would go pick out

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.250
of that bucket to go solve it.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.250
That isn't trying to
solve an entire component

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:46.910
model because of that.

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:48.490
And then content
adjustments-- who

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:50.875
here has wanted to put an
icon in an option element?

00:16:50.875 --> 00:16:51.880
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Me.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.150
GREG WHITWORTH: Good gracious!

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:53.650
Come on.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.270
You should be able to do that.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.850
So hopefully, as we
dig in to the select,

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:59.590
we'll focus first
on styling and then

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:02.110
be able to insert an icon
into an option element.

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.996
More than that, but I'm just
saying non-text-based content.

00:17:04.996 --> 00:17:07.329
So that's what we'll be talking
with the next generation

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:07.829
of select.

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:10.940
I'm super stoked to get
started working on it,

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.672
and we'll be telling you
how we'll be investigating

00:17:13.672 --> 00:17:14.380
that in a minute.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.755
NICOLE SULLIVAN:
And hopefully be

00:17:15.755 --> 00:17:17.760
able to put arbitrary
HTML in a select element.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:18.240
GREG WHITWORTH: Exactly.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.365
That's going to be awesome.

00:17:19.365 --> 00:17:21.420
NICOLE SULLIVAN: That
would be awesome.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:25.300
So we've talked about the first
three phases of this project.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.119
And now we also heard that you
would like some new components.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:31.410
And so we'd like
to talk about that.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.490
The most requested
native controls are

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:35.500
virtual-list and toggle-switch.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.300
Chrome is working
on both of those.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:37.752
GREG WHITWORTH: Woo-hoo!

00:17:37.752 --> 00:17:38.627
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Yay.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.520
So virtual scroller is the
most requested new component.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.740
In fact, Pete Hunt reminds
us every year since 2015--

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:48.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.283
--that he still doesn't
have a UI table view.

00:17:51.283 --> 00:17:51.950
Thank you, Pete.

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:54.430
Please keep asking.

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:56.317
It looks like he forgot in 2018.

00:17:56.317 --> 00:17:58.650
GREG WHITWORTH: I think it's
because he was just so mad.

00:17:58.650 --> 00:17:59.650
He was like, I'm done.

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:00.990
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Maybe.

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:03.110
So he rightly says
that UI table view

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:06.440
is the foundation for
all apps with a feed I'd

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.538
count e-commerce.

00:18:07.538 --> 00:18:09.080
If you have a lot
of products, that's

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.700
basically the same thing.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:14.400
Even something with long amounts
of content, like Wikipedia.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.760
So the need is clearly there.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:16.760
But I want to be honest.

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:20.160
This is a really hard problem
to do well in the browser.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.370
So we're creating prototypes,
trying things out,

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:26.150
and trying to find the
best possible solution.

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:27.950
One of our virtual
scroller prototypes

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:31.650
is showing promise for scroll
performance improvements

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:34.850
using a new platform primitive
called display locking.

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:38.760
Display locking is available
in origin trial right now,

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:42.380
and it unlocks a lot
of different features.

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.270
It allows you to batch
rendering updates

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:46.770
to avoid paying the
performance costs for--

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:50.270
yeah, it's really good
for large amounts of DOM.

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:53.648
It also means that
locked sub-trees are not

00:18:53.648 --> 00:18:55.190
rendered immediately,
which means you

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:57.650
can keep more stuff in the DOM.

00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:00.460
That's great, because it
becomes searchable both by Find

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:04.310
in Page as well as by
assistive technologies.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:05.060
So let's be clear.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.650
This isn't UI table view.

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:07.910
I'm sorry, Pete.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:09.440
I hope we'll get there.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.080
But it is definitely a
step in that direction.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.550
It's IN origin trial right now.

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:14.883
Please, we'd love your feedback.

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:19.910
We've also been working on
the toggle switch, which

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:23.420
allows developers to
semantically express the on/off

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.880
state.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.500
We started out with
a ton of research

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.890
into how other design systems
handle toggle behavior.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:33.800
We coded a prototype-- you
can try it, it's on GitHub--

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:37.280
and we used it to drive out
new low-level APIs and better

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.240
accessibility.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.180
So three low-level APIs and
improvements in particular

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:46.450
are form-associated custom
elements, custom element

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:51.305
accessibility, and
focusable custom elements.

00:19:51.305 --> 00:19:54.097
GREG WHITWORTH: So we've covered
all these wonderful aspects.

00:19:54.097 --> 00:19:55.680
Hopefully, you've
enjoyed all of them.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.972
The accessibility touch and
the visual refresh of those

00:19:57.972 --> 00:20:00.510
wonderful '95-era controls.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:02.420
The stylability, yes,
let's be able to style

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:05.400
a select and a radio
element, for goodness sakes.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.530
Extending the functionality,
and the new components

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:11.285
that Nicole just referenced.

00:20:11.285 --> 00:20:13.830
NICOLE SULLIVAN: And now we'd
like to ask for your help.

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:16.927
GREG WHITWORTH: Please.

00:20:16.927 --> 00:20:18.510
NICOLE SULLIVAN: We
want to be honest.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:21.300
It is really hard to standardize
high-level components.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.740
There are a lot of moving parts.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.045
It's frankly easier
to get agreement

00:20:26.045 --> 00:20:27.420
on something like
display locking

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.087
than it is to get
agreement on something

00:20:29.087 --> 00:20:32.760
like a virtual scroller or
a higher-level component.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.710
So what we need is for
you to get involved,

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:36.960
for you to let us know if
this is something you want

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.880
and how much you
want it, to let us

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.090
know which components you
think would be missing

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.962
and that you would use
in your design systems.

00:20:44.962 --> 00:20:46.420
GREG WHITWORTH:
And so to that end,

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.270
we've been meeting,
as I noted earlier,

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:51.810
with many different
design systems frameworks

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:54.720
across the industry, doing
customer interviews with them,

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.037
to better clarify.

00:20:56.037 --> 00:20:58.620
Some of the survey questions we
had get into the nitty gritty,

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.510
get into what we can offer
them that they would use

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.010
in their design systems across
some of the largest companies

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.640
in web properties on the web.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.983
If you happen to work on a
design system or framework,

00:21:08.983 --> 00:21:10.150
please get in touch with us.

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:11.640
We're more than happy to chat

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.223
NICOLE SULLIVAN:
Ionic, in particular,

00:21:13.223 --> 00:21:16.050
has been really helpful in
identifying gaps and suggesting

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:16.860
solutions.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:17.880
GREG WHITWORTH: Huge
shout out to them.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.255
NICOLE SULLIVAN:
Yes, definitely.

00:21:19.255 --> 00:21:21.510
GREG WHITWORTH: So I'm
very excited about this,

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:23.730
because as she noted, it's
very hard to standardize

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:26.490
high-level components
and controls.

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:28.920
But in order to do that, we
need to bring, as we noted,

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.813
the design system people that
work on controls and components

00:21:31.813 --> 00:21:34.230
every single day together with
the platform engineers that

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:37.260
can hopefully make those become
a reality, built in natively.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.870
And so we started-- it's
in its infancy in the YCG,

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:42.550
as you heard Yoav and Chris
talking about earlier.

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:44.130
It's something called Open UI.

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:47.340
And basically, a bunch of
Microsoft-designed system teams

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.940
are coming together to help
solve the same problem.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.640
Do you want to jump
to the next slide?

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:51.780
Perfect.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:52.350
Thank you.

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:53.640
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Sorry.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.750
GREG WHITWORTH: That's OK.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.050
So open-ui.org-- it's
where we're beginning.

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:58.050
We're in Silicon Valley.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:00.180
If you want to get
on the ground floor,

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:01.630
this is going to be a big deal.

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:04.195
So you can get in
here, help us out.

00:22:04.195 --> 00:22:06.570
Go add your own design system,
your own design component.

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:08.963
We're trying to really use
what the industry has already

00:22:08.963 --> 00:22:10.380
been using-- the
design systems, I

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:12.348
mean you worked
on them for years.

00:22:12.348 --> 00:22:14.140
We've been doing this
forever, and so we're

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.810
trying to actually just take
the cow paths you already

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:17.830
have created and
try to go pave them.

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:21.145
So go there, start
a GitHub issue.

00:22:21.145 --> 00:22:22.770
We'll be keeping you
posted on research

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:24.960
and getting your feedback,
as well as platform APIs

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.571
we want your feedback on,
such as display locking.

00:22:28.571 --> 00:22:31.050
NICOLE SULLIVAN:
Finally, submit bugs.

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:33.297
We want these form controls
to meet your needs.

00:22:33.297 --> 00:22:35.130
Whether you're a designer,
framework author,

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:37.110
or maintain a
design system, we'd

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:40.290
love to hear about anywhere
that there are gaps.

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:42.840
And I know, I remember
being intimidated when I

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.312
submitted my first browser bug.

00:22:44.312 --> 00:22:45.770
And I was like,
oh, no, is it going

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:47.520
to turn out to
actually not be a bug,

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.770
and I just didn't understand?

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:54.000
But I do want to say that
both PMs and engineers really

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:54.960
welcome your input.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.180
It's a huge signal in
deciding what we work on

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:58.810
and what gets attention.

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:00.990
So if you see bugs
when we release,

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:06.245
in a little while, these
components, let us know,

00:23:06.245 --> 00:23:07.620
and we'd love to
hear about that.

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.240
GREG WHITWORTH: Also, star
the ones if you find them.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.400
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Yeah star
the ones that you really want.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:11.640
GREG WHITWORTH: That's signal.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.120
NICOLE SULLIVAN:
That's super helpful.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.880
Again, @stubbornella on Twitter.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.760
Please get in touch.

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.520
GREG WHITWORTH:
And Greg Whitworth.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.440
Thank you so much.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:18.740
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Bye.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:19.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:22.390
