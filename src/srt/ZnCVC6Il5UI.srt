00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.875
SOC SIENG: There are
many ways to add support

00:00:01.875 --> 00:00:03.460
for payments on your website.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.550
But which one is right for
you and your customers?

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:07.440
My name is Soc.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.717
And I am a developer
advocate with Google Pay.

00:00:10.717 --> 00:00:12.300
Today, I want to
provide some guidance

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.210
on how you, as developers, can
enhance the online checkout

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.610
experience for your customers.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.290
Specifically, I'll
walk you through how

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.420
to make payments
simple and more secure

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.060
with autofill and Google Pay.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.700
In many cases, people
make online purchases

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.400
with a credit or debit card.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.080
Providing this
information is often

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.010
accompanied with requests
for other details,

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.740
like a user's shipping
or billing address.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.160
Autofill simplifies this
experience for users

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.960
by making their
payment details readily

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.660
available during
the checkout flow.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.300
Autofill does most of
the work for the user.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.270
And no additional effort is
required by website operators

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.850
to take advantage of it.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.343
Autofill works by providing
a list of suggested payment

00:00:52.343 --> 00:00:53.760
and contact details
that have been

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.980
saved to the user's browser.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.780
If the user is
signed into Chrome,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.090
Chrome autofill extends
this by asking the user

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.030
to save these details
to their Google account.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.670
This action makes the user's
payment and contact details

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.400
available across any of
the Chrome-enabled devices.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.430
Checkout forms can
vary significantly

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.320
from one website to another.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.900
To account for this,
Chrome autofill

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.790
uses heuristics to identify
payment and contact detail

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.900
fields.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.940
To improve the
effectiveness of autofill

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.440
and to ensure that
your users have

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.980
a great autofill experience,
make sure your form fields are

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.720
tagged with their
respective attributes

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.280
for credit card fields
and address fields.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.770
Links to autofill resources
can be found in the video's

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.120
description below.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.610
With Google Pay, you can
make checkout even easier

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.100
for customers by eliminating
payment and shipping

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.990
forms altogether.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.565
Google Pay provides users with
a simple and secure method

00:01:45.565 --> 00:01:47.190
for entering their
payment and shipping

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.230
information on websites.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.900
Plus, it works across
all modern browsers.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.850
Hundreds of millions
of Google users

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.240
already have their payment
details saved to Google Pay.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.130
That means purchases
are just a click away.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.610
They don't even
need to enter a CVC.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.490
In addition to accepting credit
card and debit card payments,

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.550
Google Pay offers additional
payment methods like PayPal.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.460
Once configured, using
PayPal as a payment method

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.020
with Google Pay
no longer requires

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.670
the user to re-enter
their PayPal

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.740
password when making a payment.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.347
The security and privacy of user
data is paramount to Google.

00:02:20.347 --> 00:02:21.930
And this is no
different when it comes

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.910
to payment data in Google Pay.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.380
Payment credentials
are encrypted

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.480
for secure payment processing.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.880
Integrating the Google Pay
button into your website

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.210
is easy, and testing it out
requires very little effort.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.910
First, include the Google
Pay JavaScript file,

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.310
check if the user is ready to
pay, add the Google Pay button,

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.890
request payment data, and
finally, extract the payment

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.840
token for processing.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.320
A detailed step-by-step guide is
available as a code lab linked

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.900
in the description below.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.100
To speed up and simplify
the purchasing experience

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.620
for your customers, add
the Google Pay button

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.120
to checkout floor, shopping
cart, and product pages.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.130
Google Pay is always
making improvements

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.470
for both our
merchants and users.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.170
So keep an eye out for new
features, like promo codes

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.280
and offers.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.320
We've also been experimenting
with enhancements

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.880
to the Google Pay button.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.400
And early results have
shown increased usage rates

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.320
amongst users.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.142
If you're interested in early
access to these new features,

00:03:19.142 --> 00:03:21.600
please let us know by following
the link in the description

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.190
below.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.480
What about the
Payment Request API?

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.260
The Payment Request
API is a W3C standard

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.420
that helps users share
their payment and contact

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.660
details with websites
using web or native payment

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.120
apps, like Google Pay.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.980
If you are a payment
app provider,

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.010
we encourage you to explore the
Payment Request APIs as a way

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.690
to offer your users an enhanced
experience on Chrome browsers.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.090
Payment app creators can
use the web payment standard

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.240
to deliver a better
user experience.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.830
The Google Pay
JavaScript Library

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.450
leverages the
Payment Request API

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.410
to provide a native experience
on Chrome for Android

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.900
with a native experience rolling
out soon on Chrome for desktop.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.880
At the moment, the
Payment Request API

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.640
is not consistently
supported across all browsers

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.360
and requires developers to
include browser specific logic.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.160
Therefore, to accept
Google Pay, we

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.470
recommend that developers
integrate with the Google Pay

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.450
JavaScript Library directly.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.700
Google Pay can simplify
your customer's purchasing

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.390
experience by eliminating the
need to interact with a payment

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.560
form completely.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.800
In addition, it provides
a simple browser agnostic

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.010
API for developers, a
simple and secure payment

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.520
experience for users on
both mobile and desktop,

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.480
support for additional forms
of payment, and, in the future,

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.750
access to features like
promo code and offers.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.970
When used together,
autofill and Google Pay

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.410
can help make payments
simple and secure.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.840
Thanks for watching
and see you next time.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.790
