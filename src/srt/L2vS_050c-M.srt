UNA KRAVETS: Hi,
I'm Una and I'm here

00:00:01.632 --> 00:00:04.350
to cover what's new in
material design on the web.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.750
We've got a lot to go
over, so let's get started.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.460
The first update is the Material
Theme Builder tool on Glitch.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.980
The tool itself is a
self-contained application that

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.590
showcases each of the
material components with

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.710
prompts to update
the base theme shown.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.140
It helps teams to leverage
the three subsystems

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.880
of theming within Material--

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.970
typography, shape, and color.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.610
The tool uses SAS
variables to show users

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.500
how to adjust an
interface style,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.410
and make their own brands shine
by changing just a few lines

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.140
of code within a theme file.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.270
For example, color
can be adjusted

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.870
via a series of variables,
such as primary, secondary,

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.270
background, and surface colors.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.220
These come paired
with on colors,

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.350
which represent the
text color on top

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.040
of a variable background.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.050
Shape customization can be
made for three component size

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.340
classes--

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.890
small, medium, and
large components.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.770
Small components include
buttons and input,

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.190
medium components include
modals and dialogues,

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.790
and large components
include menus and drawers.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.990
There's a great shape
tool on material.io

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.100
to help you visualize these
changes on our components

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.590
before applying them
to your code base.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.680
And finally, we can
adjust typography

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.440
through the generalized
MDC typography variable,

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.810
or through SAS maps that
allow you to customize

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.690
individual typographic
levels, such as having

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.110
a separate weight and font
family for primary headlines

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.300
rather than the body copy.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.100
In the end, your theme could
look something like this.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.550
This is just one example that
comes from Google Developer

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.742
Days in China.

00:01:39.742 --> 00:01:41.700
We've made thousands of
themes around the world

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.520
so far, so head over to
Glitch to add your own.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.440
We're also working on
a set of guidelines

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.370
for adapting dark themes
using Material components.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.910
For example, in a dark theme,
Google Materials color palette

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.300
reduces intensity to
mitigate visual vibration

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.050
or strong color contrast
against a darker background.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.020
Instead of solely adding drop
shadows to illustrate elevation

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.130
and depth, in a dark theme,
a lighter overlay is applied.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.110
Check out the
material.io guidelines

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.170
for more design guidance on
how to transition your designs

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.790
into a dark theme, considering
contrast, depth, desaturation,

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.760
and limiting colors
for accessibility.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.100
To help with this
transition, MDC Web

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.920
has released a set of
typography-themed variables

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.790
that respond to background
shades for text styles.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.890
You can now also use
the theme variables

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.940
in three different ways.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.760
The most supportive
and robust technique

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.570
is with our SAS styling API,
using variables and mix-ins

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.610
to override styles.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.460
You can also create CSS
classes with the variable names

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.120
to style them by.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.950
And finally, for
modern browsers,

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.865
CSS custom properties can be
used for the theme styling.

00:02:51.865 --> 00:02:54.240
We're still working on full
support for custom properties

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.520
at this time.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.220
We provide so many options
because theming should not

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.390
be limiting.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.000
You can extend the theme
builder to make your own theme

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.950
as unique as your product.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.130
Leverage our code and build on
top of our Material components

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.350
to quickly and easily get
started building product

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.150
on the web.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.970
The next new feature in
Material is data tables.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.950
You asked, we listened.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.170
Our designers consider
these three principles

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.430
when it comes to data tables.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.740
The first is that data must be
organized in a meaningful way.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.640
Data tables should also be
allowed for user interaction.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.280
And finally, those interactions
should be as logical

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.360
as the structure of
the data table itself.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.970
Data tables come with some
basic default functionality,

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.770
such as row selection.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.390
But you can also hook them
up to other components,

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.407
such as these filter chips.

00:03:46.407 --> 00:03:48.490
Check out the links provided
below for a deep dive

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:49.948
into how you can
actually implement

00:03:49.948 --> 00:03:53.650
data tables in your web projects
and combine Material components

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.930
for orchestrated actions.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.710
We also have a new density
subsystem option in Material.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.070
Material design uses
low-density space by default,

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.560
with large tap
targets and margins,

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.140
but offers high-density space
when it improves the user

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.150
experience.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.620
We brought density
into our system

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.430
for the following reasons.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.430
The first is for scanability.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.519
Scanability is improved
for data-heavy applications

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.079
with a higher density interface.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.990
The second is that
dense UIs may actually

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.230
help users focus by reducing
space between actions.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.650
And finally, more content
is available to the user

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.070
on a single screen in more
high-density applications.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.070
Whether or not to
increase your UI's density

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.324
can be determined by how users
interact with the component.

00:04:39.324 --> 00:04:41.230
Components with
high density enable

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.260
users to process and take
action against large amounts

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.230
of information in a
more manageable way.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.080
Lists, tables, and long
forums are components that

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.520
benefit from increased density.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.330
But density shouldn't be
used for every component.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.610
For example, don't apply
density to components

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.930
that involve focused tasks
or alert the user of changes,

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.490
such as snack bars or dialogues.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.250
Applying high density to
alerts reduces their ability

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.900
to command attention.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.910
A series of new styling
classes on the web

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.860
allows for us to access
density in three ways--

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.760
the default component
size, a comfortable size,

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.640
which provides a higher density
display while respecting

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.850
minimum touch target
size, and compact,

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.820
which may be used for pages
with a lot of information

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.160
but may be inappropriate
for user actions.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.910
Materials.io got
an update as well.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.860
We now provide a
cross platform view

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.450
of all of our
component offerings

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.490
on a dedicated components page.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.010
This page allows
for quick access

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.385
to components and overview of
cross-platform availability.

00:05:42.385 --> 00:05:44.590
It should make it easier
to navigate our product

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.780
and implement it for your needs.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.450
Check out material.io/components
to browse them all yourself.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.120
And finally, we're kicking
off a new initiative this year

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.480
to focus on supporting
Material across web frameworks.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.000
Why?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
We know that most of you
are developing web apps

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.260
using a framework.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.950
And the open source community
has stepped up immensely,

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.720
building components for some of
the most adopted web frameworks

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.893
out there.

00:06:08.893 --> 00:06:11.310
We want to celebrate this work
and help bring the Material

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.937
design vision to life, along
with our open source community.

00:06:14.937 --> 00:06:17.020
So many of you have already
built your own wrapper

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.830
libraries using MDC Web's
components, foundations,

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.327
and adapters.

00:06:22.327 --> 00:06:24.160
And we're working more
closely with the rest

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.030
of the open source
community as well.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.150
We've updated
material.io to link

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.880
to three of the most popular
open source component

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.362
libraries.

00:06:32.362 --> 00:06:34.570
They've already uncovered
bugs in the Material design

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.590
guidelines, and asked
great questions,

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.753
helping us to make
Material even better.

00:06:38.753 --> 00:06:41.170
And we're helping them to
follow the spec and the Material

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.420
guidelines more closely as well.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.623
We look forward to
continuing the conversation

00:06:45.623 --> 00:06:47.290
and working to bring
the Material design

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.140
vision to every platform and
framework, making it easier

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:54.070
for everyone to use
Material design on the web.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.810
There's so much to
explore and play with,

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.660
from theming to
density to data tables

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.810
to new website features, and
our open source community.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.370
It's an exciting time to
be building with Material.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.462
So check out material.io
and the links

00:07:06.462 --> 00:07:08.920
below where you can find all
the resources that I mentioned

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.890
today.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.160
Can't wait to see what
you build with Material.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.270
I'll see you on the web.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.820
