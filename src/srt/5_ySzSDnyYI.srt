TOM GREENAWAY: Hi,
I'm Tom Greenaway,

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.440
and I'm the games lead for the
Web Developer Relations team

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.970
here at Google.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.910
Now I know what you might
be thinking, web games,

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.650
is that really a thing?

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.390
Isn't flash a little bit passe?

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.710
And compared to native mobile
games on Android and iPhone,

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.810
can the web really even compete?

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.090
Well, in this Lightning
Talk, I will quickly

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.680
highlight some of
the opportunities

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.490
but also the challenges that the
web offers to game developers.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.490
I'll touch on topics such
as why raw performance isn't

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.049
the most important
thing in a game, what

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.980
the major strengths and the
weaknesses of the web are,

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.170
and lastly, a few
examples of game design

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.280
patents you can use to leverage
when designing for the web.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.230
So firstly, the raw performance
of the device or the games

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.210
built for it.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.180
That's what decides the most
successful games and platforms,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.290
right?

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.730
Well, not really.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.440
In the history of
game development,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.390
usually it's the platforms
and the games that

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.410
deliver some kind of mixture
of innovation, ease of access,

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.140
and last but not least, fun.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.280
In fact, I would say fun is the
most important factor in games,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.850
much more important than
the graphical fidelity.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.610
But let's dive into these three
properties a little bit more

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.920
in depth with some examples.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.220
So innovation, think about when
the first motion-controlled

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.470
games took off.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.600
The best-selling console out
of the Playstation 3, the Xbox

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.360
360, and the
Nintendo Wii, it was

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.180
the latter, the console
with the weakest performance

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.080
but the most hardware
innovation and ease of access.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.370
Well, this can mean many things.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.000
Whether games are easy
to buy and download

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.480
or whether a device is
portable and always with you.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.700
This is one of the reasons
why mobile gaming has

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.860
boomed over the last decade.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.260
The Google Play store
and the Apple App Store

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.480
have made it ridiculously
easy to download

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.790
a game to your device,
and these games

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.690
are right there in your
pocket, always ready to play.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.760
And lastly, what about fun?

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.810
Some of the most successful
mobile games of all time

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.790
were not pushing the graphical
limits of their devices.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.920
They focused on being fun.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.380
Think of the early mobile
hits like Fruit Ninja

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.630
or Angry Birds.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.450
In other words, if you play to
the strengths of your platform

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.200
and make fun your
priority, there

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.930
are often compelling
game designs

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.700
waiting to be discovered.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.860
So what are the strengths
of your platform?

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.800
What are the
strengths of the web?

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.890
Well firstly, it's the most
open and biggest platform

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.600
that's ever been created.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.470
Nearly every device in the
world has a web browser.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.050
And there are no limits
on how you can monetize--

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.690
micro transactions,
subscriptions, paywalls,

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.590
or ads.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.740
There are no rules
on the web, right?

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.070
And the web is instantaneous
and almost frictionless.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.200
With just a tap,
the user can jump

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.230
into your content via a
link they find anywhere,

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.170
whether that's on the
web or inside of an app.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.180
But like the hero
of any great story,

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.360
these strengths are also the
web's greatest weaknesses.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.400
It runs on almost all devices.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.320
So to take full
advantage of that,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.930
you must design your
game to be responsive

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.350
and to be aware of different
devices, screen resolutions,

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.650
and potentially develop for
the lowest common denominator.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.040
For example, mobile safari
only supports WebGL 1.0.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.350
And what about payments?

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.750
Well, the Google Play Store
and the Apple App Store

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.140
ushered in a new era of simple
and trusted payment processing,

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.390
and in-app purchases
were created.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.940
And sadly, the web doesn't
have built-in payment methods

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.480
like this, which means that
there's a higher friction when

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.030
users are being asked to pay.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.120
However, there are a lot
of web platforms and APIs

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.360
which help alleviate this
problem, such as Google Pay

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.340
Stripe, PayPal, and even
browser APIs, like web payments.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.320
And lastly, the
instantaneousness

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.910
of the web that I mentioned?

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.060
Yes, it's great that a user can
load your content instantly.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.740
But to make that
really work, you

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.250
need to fine tune your content
to load as fast as possible.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.280
And the weakness is that just as
easily as a user open your web

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.440
page, they can close it as well.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.830
The ephemerality of the web is
both powerful and yet fragile

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.630
at the same time.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.070
But if you play
your cards right,

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.230
you can make a game
successful on the web

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.240
by leaning on these
strengths and mitigating

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.010
these weaknesses.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.440
So what's the most
unique feature of the web

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.410
that we can hone in on
with our game design?

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.940
It's the link.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.100
The beauty of the web browser
is that just as easily as you

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.940
were linked to a piece of
content, you, as a user,

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.570
know that you can now share
that link to someone else.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.390
And so that cycle of being
linked and then linking others

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.510
to content, that's the
power of the web, really.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.380
It's viral.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.510
It's the modern day,
word-of-mouth marketing

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.010
machine.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.600
So how can you work the link
itself into your game design?

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.910
The key is that we
want to drive virality.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.940
We want to give the user
a reason to share the game

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.340
and for the link that they
share to be meaningful

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.970
not just to them, but
to others as well.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.070
So what interesting information
can be shared in a link?

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.760
Well, here are three categories
you can experiment with--

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.990
competition, collaboration,
and exploration.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.560
But what would the URLs of
these games really look like?

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.870
Well, I could create
a puzzle in a game,

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.140
and then I could share
a URL, and that URL

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.020
could be a playable link
to that particular puzzle.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.010
Or I could finish a level
and I could share the URL.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.410
And what I share could
be a player ghost

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.890
of me completing that level
for others to compete against.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.500
And lastly, I could be
playing a rogue-like game,

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.960
discovering new
areas of the world,

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.120
and I could find a secret room.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.130
And then if I
share the URL, that

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.260
could teleport a friend
into that same room

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.460
that I've discovered.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.650
Now for example,
here is a game called

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.160
Shellshock.io where players
compete in a quake style arena

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.180
shootout.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.400
If the player shares
that current URL,

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.490
their friends can deep link into
that exact room the player is

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.380
in and compete against them.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.920
Also here's a little game I
made called Space Board, built

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.040
using the slick game
development tool Construct,

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.230
which, by the way,
not only produces

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.810
HTML5 games for the
web, but is, unto

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.110
itself, an entirely web-based
development environment.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.820
So I designed this
game to demonstrate

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.920
how your URLs can be
used to transmit data

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.810
for the purposes of game design.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.290
And inside of it is a level
editor I built into the game.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.290
When you play the game,
you can send a link,

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.900
and the link contains
the entire level's design

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.100
that you've created.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.010
Here on the left is the
game itself being played.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.850
Try it out.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.820
The game can be played
on desktop or on mobile.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.250
And why am I showing
a QR code as well?

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.040
Well, because QR codes can be
a marketing tool for promoting

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.230
content in the physical world.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.060
If you access that
URL in the QR code,

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.460
it will take you
to another level

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.430
I made, but this one's a
little bit more intense.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.770
Now you can imagine that
Space Board could also

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.680
generate QR codes
of levels that could

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.740
be shared with a friend
in person as well.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.280
So in summary, if you're curious
about the web's potential

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.050
for game developers,
think about how

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.930
you can play to the
strengths of the platform.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.200
Support as many devices as
possible, think outside the box

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.420
when building your
monetization model,

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.820
and build your game to
load as fast as possible

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.600
so users can jump into it
and play your game instantly.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.320
But most importantly,
make your game fun.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.390
Design it to be viral, to
leverage the URL so users

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.130
have a reason to
share it and spread

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.530
the word about your game.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.580
Thanks, and see you next time.
