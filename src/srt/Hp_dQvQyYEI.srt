[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.325 --> 00:00:07.450
PJ MCLACHLAN: Your users
know that the word install

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.742
means that it's software
that's meant for their device,

00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:11.815
and you want to meet
your users' expectations.

00:00:11.815 --> 00:00:14.440
So that's what you see there on
the right, an app that launches

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.500
from the home screen and is
essentially indistinguishable

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.370
from a native experience.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.430
Let's start at the beginning
of the story though.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.097
Bookmarks are the
original way for users

00:00:24.097 --> 00:00:27.340
to get back to anywhere on the
web they wanted to get back to.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.298
They're kind of a
universal install button,

00:00:29.298 --> 00:00:31.340
and they've been available
on every major browser

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.490
since the dawn of the web.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.300
So a good question would be,
why don't we just use that?

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.620
And in a word, the
answer is mobile.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.560
Of course, you can
bookmark on mobile,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.810
but it never really
fully made the jump.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.210
And we do see significantly
less bookmark usage on mobile

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.555
than we see on desktop.

00:00:45.555 --> 00:00:47.180
One reason for that
is that the UI just

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.310
isn't quite as convenient.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.018
And that's not just
saving the bookmarks,

00:00:50.018 --> 00:00:55.690
it's also organizing and
finding them as well.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.080
The second challenge that we
see for bookmarks on mobile

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.375
is that apps, as we
just saw right now,

00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:02.250
integrate into the mobile
OS in ways that are

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.730
important for functionality.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.277
So for example, a
lot of apps do need

00:01:06.277 --> 00:01:08.610
to tie in to, say, Android's
native sharing sheet, which

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.568
is what you see on the
right side of the slide,

00:01:10.568 --> 00:01:13.200
where a URL is shared from
the Myntra PWA to Twitter.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.990
And to enable a share target,
we needed OS level entity.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.930
We need something like
an APK on Android,

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.000
and not just a bookmark

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.070
A lot of you will be
familiar with this term Add

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.695
to Home Screen.

00:01:24.695 --> 00:01:26.903
And again, you see that on
the right in the Starbucks

00:01:26.903 --> 00:01:28.125
screenshot in this example.

00:01:28.125 --> 00:01:29.500
Unfortunately,
Add to Home Screen

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.602
can actually mean
two different things.

00:01:31.602 --> 00:01:33.310
It could mean that
it's a bookmark that's

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.800
being placed on the home
screen, or it could also

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.480
mean that it's
actually an integrated

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.190
experience on the device.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.110
And that's why we'll be
using the word install

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.360
for the rest of this talk
to talk about the integrated

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.960
experience.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.990
And in the future, you're going
to see this in the browser UI

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.670
on mobile and desktop.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.280
The reason for that is
install is a UX affordance

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.320
that's familiar to
mobile users who

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.530
are used to adding content
from their OS's stores,

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.530
such as Play, and then
finding that content again

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.740
on the device through whatever
the native launch surfaces are.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.770
So on mobile, usually
from the home screen.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.433
Install aligns to a user's
mental model for how install--

00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:12.850
basically, how experiences
ought to operate on the device.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.900
An installed web app looks and
feels like every other app.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.450
And the fact that your user
discovered and installed

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.120
your app from the
browser or from Play

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.070
shouldn't actually
matter when they go back

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.090
to use your app again.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.200
Most importantly, the word
install signals to users

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.005
that the experience was meant
to be great on their device.

00:02:38.607 --> 00:02:40.190
Here's a summary of
how web install is

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.650
different from bookmarks.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.410
Web install offers
users access to web apps

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.880
from familiar
discovery and launch

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.710
surfaces for their device.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.448
So install web apps
can be standalone.

00:02:49.448 --> 00:02:51.490
That means they can be
separate from the browser.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.190
It also means that they can be
integrated into the native task

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.060
switcher.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.030
And they can-- this is gonna be
a more familiar way for users

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.470
to interact with
apps, or it might

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.180
be more suitable to certain
types of tasks than tabs.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.140
Web install integrates
the web apps

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.270
with the device services
that expect an installed app.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.140
The important thing to remember
when you're asking a user

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.690
to install a PWA is that
with an installed app,

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.030
you're telling the user that
it is an experience that

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.190
is meant for the device
that the user is using,

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.360
and that means that
you need to live up

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.068
to those expectations
of what you design,

00:03:21.068 --> 00:03:22.850
or you're going to
have unhappy users.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.183
There's a good thing that we
have a pattern for building

00:03:25.183 --> 00:03:27.540
experiences that do just that.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.600
Progressive Web Apps are
a pattern for great apps

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.860
that use web technology.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.860
And they have all the
features and functionality

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.240
users expect from a modern
app on mobile or desktop.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.740
I'm sure most of
you in this room

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.550
are quite familiar with
PWAs at this point,

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.270
so I'll just cover some of
the very high level background

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.370
information about PWAs
for those of you who

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.323
maybe are new to the concept.

00:03:46.323 --> 00:03:48.240
PWAs include things like
personalized content,

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.250
offline mode, push
notifications,

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.510
and instant loading.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.460
And PWAs and installed web
apps do go hand in hand.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.910
You need to have a PWA in
order to offer install.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.487
There are, of course,
other projects

00:03:59.487 --> 00:04:01.070
that are trying to
crack this problem,

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.513
and you can take a look at React
Native, at Electron or Cordova.

00:04:04.513 --> 00:04:06.305
And all of these are
basically offering you

00:04:06.305 --> 00:04:09.300
a way to build native
apps using web technology,

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.060
but those experiences do depend
on functionality that won't

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.850
also work in the web browser.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.617
PWA's goal is to build
directly on the web.

00:04:16.617 --> 00:04:18.450
So that means you can
maintain one code base

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.720
and that's going to work for
visitors both in the browser

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.430
as well as for your
installed users.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.857
SAM THOROGOOD: So hi.

00:04:27.857 --> 00:04:29.940
I'm lucky enough to get
to work on "Santa Tracker"

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.220
every year, which is
a fun holiday themed

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.810
experience for all ages.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.343
And so we'll be using this
as an example as we go along.

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:38.760
Santa runs on
basically everything

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.163
with a browser, even this
magical screen changing device.

00:04:42.163 --> 00:04:43.830
And so we find that
folks who install it

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.990
to their home screens on
any one of these platforms

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.323
where it's supported are some
of our most engaged users,

00:04:48.323 --> 00:04:49.880
coming back the most often.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.570
And on Android alone,
a few years ago,

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.250
we found that about
10% of all our loads

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.960
were coming from
that installed icon.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.020
So that's a quite nice number.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.440
This is fundamentally because,
when an app is installed,

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.760
your users will feel like
it is designed for them.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.010
Users will have better
engagement, more loyalty,

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.635
and have a positive
experience with you

00:05:06.635 --> 00:05:09.640
with your installed application.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.980
But of course, who
are these users?

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.345
Who is going to benefit
from this extra power?

00:05:14.345 --> 00:05:16.720
We're the first ones to admit
that it won't be everybody.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.570
The power of the web has always
been that it is ephemeral.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.090
Users can move seamlessly
between experiences,

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.080
and so you shouldn't expect
all of your users to install.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.790
And to that end, there is
a bit of an install funnel.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.870
This is the same as native
apps or e-commerce conversions.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.245
Most strategies for
optimization apply here as well.

00:05:34.245 --> 00:05:36.370
You don't want to push the
user to convert too soon

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.330
or they'll leave
your site running.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.130
You should only promote install
to users who are frequent users

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.190
or who will actually
benefit from your services.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.270
You know, focus on
features that users

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.758
might care about, like smaller
download size or faster access.

00:05:50.758 --> 00:05:53.050
You'll also want to track
the right events in analytics

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.675
to make sure you know
what to optimize.

00:05:54.675 --> 00:05:57.260
PJ will cover this
a bit later on.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.080
So promote web
install on screens

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.640
where the use case makes sense,
including desktop, tablet,

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.350
and mobile.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.290
Take this example of Spotify's
CTA from a landing page.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.910
We'll also be covering more
of these as we go along.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.160
So we've covered some of the
what and some of the why.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.540
And I'll continue now by talking
about the how of install.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.100
Your basic requirements for
supporting the installable web

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.860
are to have both our Web App
Manifest and a Service Worker.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.917
These are actually, in 2019,
pretty well documented.

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:26.500
These are the same
requirements, as we

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.050
mentioned, to be called a PWA.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.360
I'll mostly be
covering the Manifest.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.970
For the Service Worker, just
briefly, the requirement

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.160
is that you do
actually load offline.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.630
If your user clicks on your
app icon while they're offline,

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.990
and they see nothing
or an offline dino,

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.960
users will have a bad
time and so will not

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.963
allow it to be
installed in this case.

00:06:44.963 --> 00:06:47.380
I think you'll find some great
amazing content on Codelabs

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.963
for Google and Service
Workers online.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.930
The Manifest is a
simple JSON file,

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.440
which basically informs
your user how the site acts

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.323
when it's installed.

00:06:59.323 --> 00:07:01.740
You need one per app, and you
need to include a link to it

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.573
from every page of your
site so the user can

00:07:03.573 --> 00:07:05.050
tap install anywhere.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.745
And I'm kind of
trivializing it, but pretty

00:07:07.745 --> 00:07:09.870
much all modern browsers
have some level of support

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:14.047
for this file, and
including it's quite simple.

00:07:14.047 --> 00:07:15.880
You simply include a
link in pretty much all

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.560
your pages, as I
mentioned, because you

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.602
don't know where your user
will hit install from.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.070
One of its core
parts is controlling

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.270
what your launcher icon
will actually look like

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.360
and the start page that
opens when you press it.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.200
He's what an Android
experience will be.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.800
"Santa Tracker" has a little
green icon with a short name,

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.592
and you'll see something
quite similar when

00:07:34.592 --> 00:07:36.970
an app is installed on desktop.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.560
The Manifest also controls
how your app is loaded.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.630
For games, you might
choose full screen.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.100
See the example on the right.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.660
But for anything
app like, you want

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.567
standalone, which won't take
over the target device's UI.

00:07:48.567 --> 00:07:50.150
Websites running in
any mode can still

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.305
use browsers' APIs to
later request full screen.

00:07:53.305 --> 00:07:54.680
There's a few
other options here,

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.290
including browser which
retains the URL bar.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.540
But honestly, we don't think
this is that interesting,

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:00.920
and so we think
these two options are

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.295
what most people will end up
choosing when they configure

00:08:03.295 --> 00:08:06.350
their installed PWA.

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.020
The Manifest itself
is pretty boring.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.700
Here it is for completeness.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.410
I won't go through every field.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.630
Like I said, there's
actually tons of information

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.340
out there on the web.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.323
But I want to cover
some important patterns.

00:08:18.323 --> 00:08:20.240
You need to include a
few icons, including one

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.370
which is at least 512 by 512.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:24.530
And remember that this
isn't your site's fav icon,

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:26.872
so you still need to
include one of those.

00:08:26.872 --> 00:08:29.330
In building "Santa Tracker,"
one thing we really discovered

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.798
was that there's no implicit
internationalization support.

00:08:31.798 --> 00:08:34.215
You need to serve a different
Manifest for every language.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:40.480
And icons, the standard also
now describes maskable icons.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.799
The very short version
is, if you provide an icon

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.897
and indicate that it's
maskable, this is a signal

00:08:44.897 --> 00:08:47.230
to the platform that it can
cut your icon down to safely

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.890
display crazy icon
types like circles,

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.940
[? square-circles, ?]
or teardrops,

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.580
making your users feel like the
app was really made for them.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.080
And with this, we
actually recommend

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.900
not using transparency
in your PWA icons at all,

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.430
because the OS is handling
this part for you.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.170
Of course, this is
still a bit brand new,

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.480
so we recommend also
loading up your app

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.938
in some major
environments to check

00:09:05.938 --> 00:09:08.060
what the icon will look like.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.310
There's a few more things
coming in the Manifest which

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:11.772
are also worth mentioning.

00:09:11.772 --> 00:09:13.730
App shortcuts have just
been added to the spec.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.550
This lets an install icon
provide secondary intents,

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:17.770
perhaps with one press.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.145
I've kind of cheated here and
show you an Android example

00:09:20.145 --> 00:09:21.400
of this case.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.510
And Web Share Target,
which we'll cover more,

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:28.150
allows an installed web app
to be a target for sharing.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.638
We're also just seeing a bunch
of tooling around manifests.

00:09:30.638 --> 00:09:32.680
And we think that honestly,
going forward, nearly

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.170
every tool chain will just
provide you a web app manifest.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:37.878
And so while we're
glad you're listening,

00:09:37.878 --> 00:09:39.795
this stuff is also
becoming just boring enough

00:09:39.795 --> 00:09:42.220
that it's likely handled for
you, which is great for us

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.220
as web developers.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.850
So as I mentioned
earlier, Manifests

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:49.190
are supported by pretty much
all modern browsers, which

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.950
leads me on to,
well, the nuances,

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:55.180
a web developer's best friend.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.290
Let's start with Android.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:58.580
This was the first place
that install was available,

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.270
and once installed, apps
are first class citizens

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:05.290
provided by real native APKs.

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.120
Importantly, Chrome
on Android is actually

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.980
able to prompt your
users to install

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.500
if your site includes a
Service Worker and a Manifest.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.180
"Santa Tracker" here is
actually pretty ambitious.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.722
If you take a look
at this animation,

00:10:14.722 --> 00:10:16.240
even during the
loading screen, it

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.130
pops up a little mini info bar.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:21.930
It's not ideal, but we'll
revisit this in a bit.

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.030
Regardless, if you
then tap that info bar,

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.350
you'll get a full screen
prompt to install.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:28.350
There's a few things
to dissect here.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.900
While this does say Add to
Home Screen, as we mentioned,

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.520
we're moving away
from that verbiage

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.400
as we support really
so many platforms now.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.468
And as I mentioned, this
generates a real APK

00:10:37.468 --> 00:10:39.260
that works with any
launcher, and is really

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.050
a first class system for
users like any other installed

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:44.368
application.

00:10:44.368 --> 00:10:45.910
Another option for
install on Android

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:48.847
is something called Trusted
Web Activities or TWA.

00:10:48.847 --> 00:10:50.930
While this has a few
[? details ?] to get through,

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:52.760
fundamentally, you're writing
an Android application which

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.980
features a core activity
provided by Chrome,

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.580
or actually, fairly
soon, Firefox as well.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.330
And you're uploading
it to the Play Store,

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:00.830
so it's discoverable
and promotable

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.840
like any other native app.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.110
The best way to learn more
here is to go and follow

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.940
Google's Codelabs on this.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.490
Do a search for TWA
Codelabs to find out more.

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:12.990
We've also got an
interesting option

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.870
for folks who are using
Managed Play with G Suite.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:18.360
This means if your organization
signs into corporate Gmail

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.980
on their devices,
you can simply push

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.310
real APKs that load your
website by Managed Play.

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:24.990
There's quite a few steps.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.290
This video is quite long.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:27.870
But if you watch
closely here, I've

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:30.570
built "Santa Tracker for Work,"
which pushes "Santa Tracker"

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:32.388
to all the elves
and in Santa's org.

00:11:32.388 --> 00:11:34.180
So while we think this
is real interesting,

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.763
it's also worth noting that your
corporate users will actually

00:11:36.763 --> 00:11:39.480
never see the URL that's
being added to their device.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.300
You're able to push any
website as a real app, not just

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.940
your own.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.400
Finally, and probably
most interestingly,

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.120
let's talk about the how in iOS.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.370
iOS has had install for web
apps since the beginning,

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:52.912
but the last few
releases have really

00:11:52.912 --> 00:11:55.070
made install in iOS
quite practical.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:57.680
Here's an example of loading
"Santa Tracker" from the iPad.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.130
We do have to have custom icons.

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:02.210
This is done by the iOS metadata
icon tags, which I won't really

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:03.223
cover here.

00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:04.640
And while they're
a bit of a pain,

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.022
tooling can help
you generate these.

00:12:07.022 --> 00:12:08.480
Apple has also
previously suggested

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.070
providing splash screens.

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:13.530
Honestly, we don't think this
is that important anymore.

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:15.940
IOS 13 has brought you
nice animations and fades

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.440
that make sure that your website
isn't just jarringly dumped

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.550
on the screen.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:21.155
We didn't use one
in this example.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:26.740
And last but not least, I also
want to talk about desktop.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.960
Only Chrome provides install
on desktop right now,

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.020
but it works well across
all platforms, macOS, Linux,

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.858
Chrome OS, and Windows.

00:12:33.858 --> 00:12:35.650
Your sites will get
the little plus button,

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.070
and users will get a native app
that lives in their launcher.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:39.760
The plus button will
even wiggle a little bit

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.093
if you do the right thing,
calling attention to the fact

00:12:42.093 --> 00:12:43.319
that install is available.

00:12:47.557 --> 00:12:48.640
PJ MCLACHLAN: Thanks, Sam.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.598
I'd like to cover some
of the frequently missed

00:12:50.598 --> 00:12:54.030
details that will help you
acquire more installed users.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.330
So first, a lot of
companies have native apps

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.990
and worry about accidentally
promoting the PWA to a user who

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:01.250
already has their app.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:03.350
And you may want to
promote your PWA,

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:04.862
but you want to
explicitly target

00:13:04.862 --> 00:13:07.070
a group of people that are
not your native app users.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:09.770
Now, keep in mind that
there's all kinds of reasons

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:12.430
that a user may not have
or want your native app

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.180
but might still
want the web app.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.730
Storage, for example,
is the number one reason

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.950
that users remove apps
from their device.

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:21.230
But most web apps are
tiny, and the stores

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:23.240
that most web apps use
can be dynamically purged

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.910
from the browser through
either a manual cache clear

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.607
or in response to
storage pressure.

00:13:27.607 --> 00:13:29.690
So you may want to let
users know that the web app

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:32.240
option exists, but you don't
want to create any channel

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.560
conflict with your native apps.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.580
So to avoid promoting your PWA
install feature to native app

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:40.460
users, you want to use the
getInstalledRelatedApps,

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:41.900
just there to help.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.560
This API is going to let you see
in JavaScript if the user has

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.820
your native app installed.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.160
getInstalledRelatedApps
is not in stable yet,

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.050
but it is in an
origin trial, which

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:53.030
is an early access program.

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:55.340
You can still use it
on your site today.

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:58.280
An origin trial might sound
scary, but all it means

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.200
is that you need
to register online,

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.780
and the API will be enabled
for all Chrome visitors

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:03.875
to your site.

00:14:03.875 --> 00:14:06.000
SAM THOROGOOD: If only
there was some search engine

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.403
that will help you with that.

00:14:07.403 --> 00:14:08.320
PJ MCLACHLAN: If only.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.390
Most PWA installs
today are happening

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:14.710
from the mini infobar.

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:18.840
The mini infobar was only
intended as a temporary shim.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.060
It's not the best
user experience.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.340
And since it's generated
by the browser,

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.610
it really has no way of knowing
whether this particular moment

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:29.040
is the right moment
to present to the user

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.210
the option to install.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:32.130
It just shows up
as soon as the site

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.800
passes installability criteria
and the user engagement

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.075
measure.

00:14:36.075 --> 00:14:38.700
You're going to want to replace
the mini infobar with something

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:39.477
better.

00:14:39.477 --> 00:14:42.060
And we're going to get to what
is better than the mini infobar

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.490
soon, but first you
need to hide it and make

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.040
sure the mini infobar doesn't
appear if you don't want it.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.620
And all you need to do that
is to call preventDefault

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.650
on the
beforeinstallprompt event.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:54.530
Make sure that
you've added the UI

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:58.010
that you need to trigger
the install prompt

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:01.070
before you do this though,
or you will literally

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:05.200
have no installed users after
you prevent default on this.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.650
So let's look at the
code for a second.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:12.500
The relevant line is right
here, event.preventDefault.

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.100
And that's the critical thing
for hiding the mini infobar.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:19.550
Most sites, it should be
a very trivial change.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.640
So let's assume that you've got
a UI element in the page called

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.980
Install Button and
that you're going

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.900
to want to display
this Install Button as

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.625
soon as the browser signals
that your app can be installed.

00:15:29.625 --> 00:15:31.250
You don't want to
show this beforehand,

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:33.830
because this button won't work
the way that the user would

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:35.270
expect it to work.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:38.130
This element should be
hidden and then enabled,

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:42.120
and that's exactly what
we do in this next line.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.560
And finally, you're
going to want

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.670
to capture a reference
to the install event

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:48.100
so that you can use it
to prompt the user later

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.450
when the user actually clicks
on that Install button.

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:53.520
And now we can look at
exactly how you do that.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.540
So here's how you use
that save reference.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.920
So let's imagine that you want
to wait until the user has

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:04.030
finished some important journey
that's part of your experience

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:06.310
before you prompt them.

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:09.498
You could use this stored handle
for whenever you're ready.

00:16:09.498 --> 00:16:11.040
The user clicks on
the Install button

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:15.080
in your UI to trigger the
browser's UI for the install

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:15.580
prompt.

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.530
Don't forget to
instrument analytics

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:23.140
so that you can understand your
user's behavior with respect

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.790
to install prompts.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.578
There's really three
important moments

00:16:26.578 --> 00:16:28.620
that you want to capture
here for your analytics.

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:32.080
So the first is when that
prompt is actually available,

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:35.720
when did the site fulfill
the installability criteria?

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.930
And that happens with the
beforeinstallprompt event.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.013
And that's what you listen
for, and you can set up

00:16:40.013 --> 00:16:41.720
an analytics event there.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.700
The second is the analytics for
when the prompt is triggered.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.890
If you're taking the
recommended approach here

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:52.600
and you're tying that to a
piece of UI inside of your web

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.120
content, then this is going
to be probably a click

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.800
handler on some element
inside of your page.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.030
And finally, when
the user has actually

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:02.800
completed the app
install, you're

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.550
going to want to listen for
the app installed event.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:07.990
And this is what's going to
tell you that the app install

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:09.970
was completed
successfully and the user

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:12.430
hit OK from the browser UI.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.609
So you may be asking
yourself, what about iOS?

00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:20.640
And the great news here is
that iOS Safari has had support

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.310
for the essential PWA
Ingredient Service Worker

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:25.089
for quite a while now.

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:27.510
And it's easier than
ever to install PWAs

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:30.990
from iOS Safari with
Add to Home Screen

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:33.180
like moving to an option
on the first level menu.

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:36.207
So here's an install
promotional pattern for iOS

00:17:36.207 --> 00:17:38.040
that we're going to use
for "Santa Tracker."

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.840
Notice how this--
we're basically

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.600
triggering a pop-up
helper to help

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.270
the user through the install
experience from the Install

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.980
button.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.070
And this is the
same Install button

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:48.910
that we're going to
use on Android as well.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.330
So the delta between
the two experiences

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:52.770
is really quite small.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.750
SAM THOROGOOD: So
with that, I want

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:59.792
to talk briefly about a
few different UX patterns

00:17:59.792 --> 00:18:00.980
for your installed PWAs.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.580
So "Santa Tracker" is
pretty unique, right?

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.230
It already has a pretty
simple look and feel,

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:05.522
and your site probably doesn't.

00:18:05.522 --> 00:18:08.550
It looks like a
regular web page.

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.692
So the uncanny
valley for something

00:18:10.692 --> 00:18:12.650
which looks almost correct,
which is ultimately

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:15.440
just a bit off, like this
almost right dino game

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.180
with some very odd UI elements.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.390
If your experience doesn't
match your user's expectation,

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:23.060
they might be put off.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.560
So we at Google love the web,
and there's now an expectation

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.720
that perhaps an installed
app acts and feels

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.380
like it's always been that way.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.452
And this advice isn't
really unique to PWAs.

00:18:31.452 --> 00:18:32.910
I want to talk
about the feeling we

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:36.360
get when we use web apps
like Gmail, Spotify, or even

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.380
Google Docs.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.200
When I use these apps, I almost
forget that I'm on the web.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.468
How can you help your users have
that same level of immersion?

00:18:43.468 --> 00:18:45.260
There's a few tips I'd
like to talk through

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.000
to make your site
feel more native

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.260
and lose the uncanny feeling.

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.210
Focus rings are where
I'm going to start.

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:53.220
These let the user know
where the cursor is.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:54.630
Pretty basic access
accessibility

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.400
feature, which you should keep.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.758
But the default ring is a
definite tell of the web.

00:18:58.758 --> 00:19:01.050
So mix it up, and this applies
to form elements as well

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:03.302
as links.

00:19:03.302 --> 00:19:05.010
Text selection is also
probably something

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.218
you want to disable,
especially on UI components,

00:19:07.218 --> 00:19:08.760
because it's not an
expected behavior

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.560
of installed applications.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.570
Personally, I'm not ever
a fan of making this UI

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:14.945
part of a page selectable,
but it's especially pronounced

00:19:14.945 --> 00:19:17.600
when installed.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.800
And set a theme color.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.720
This refers to the
window color of your app,

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.970
as you see in this desktop
version of "Santa Tracker,"

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:23.940
where it's a dark blue.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.220
By the default, it's
from the platform,

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.390
so you don't really know
what you're going to get.

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:29.330
An over scroll, which you
can see happening here,

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:30.997
is actually somewhat
related, because it

00:19:30.997 --> 00:19:33.710
can mean that three contrasting
colors end up showing.

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:36.350
And in most cases, you just
want to disable over scroll

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.070
to prevent this from happening.

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:39.368
It's a very web pattern.

00:19:39.368 --> 00:19:40.910
As an alternative,
at least make sure

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:45.260
that your HTML tag is set to
a reasonable background color

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.120
that's not the default white.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.300
Also very briefly
mention safe area inset,

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.190
which if you're a fan
of notches on phones,

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:54.260
let you avoid that
notch and put some color

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.940
or interesting content
behind that area.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:01.600
You'll also want to think
about some UX changes.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.520
I'm going to go through
these fairly quickly.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.190
First, don't allow navigation
outside your own site.

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:09.240
If you do, users will get
a really ugly URL bar.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.990
Make sure you always
open external content

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:12.700
in a new window.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.580
Next, think about better
behavior for extended actions

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.250
like select all, undo,
and redo, especially

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:19.830
if your experience is app like.

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:23.170
But by default, undo and redo
only apply to text elements.

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:25.792
What if you're allowing
the user to reorder a list?

00:20:25.792 --> 00:20:28.000
And finally, you might want
to do something different

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.167
with the right click menu,
especially when installed

00:20:30.167 --> 00:20:30.700
on desktop.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.820
The default menu includes
items like Save as or Cast,

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:36.400
which barely make sense
on some web pages.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.010
And while it's bad practice
to disable this right click

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:41.200
menu on the web, when
you're installed,

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.190
that's really a license to
improve the user experience

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:45.190
by hiding these options.

00:20:50.043 --> 00:20:51.710
PJ MCLACHLAN: So I've
mentioned a couple

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:54.622
of times the different ways that
you can promote your web app,

00:20:54.622 --> 00:20:56.330
and here's where we
get into the examples

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:58.050
of how exactly to do it.

00:20:58.050 --> 00:20:59.972
So keep in mind, as
we go through these,

00:20:59.972 --> 00:21:01.430
that these patterns
aren't intended

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:02.670
for every kind of site.

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:05.300
They're examples
of good patterns

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.930
that you can use, but try
to understand your use cases

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:10.880
and use patterns that
are appropriate for you.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.400
And please always
remember the rule of thumb

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.710
whenever you're prompting
users about anything

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:20.026
installed or otherwise,
don't be annoying.

00:21:20.026 --> 00:21:21.153
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:21.153 --> 00:21:22.070
Let's give this a try.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.570
All right.

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:24.965
First, the header
can be a good place

00:21:24.965 --> 00:21:26.590
to promote install
of your app, but you

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:27.715
do need to be careful here.

00:21:27.715 --> 00:21:31.010
This one comes with a lot
of cautions and hand waves.

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:32.980
These are really
precious pixels,

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:36.910
and you want to use information
architecture and A/B testing

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:39.310
to determine whether it
actually makes sense for you

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:41.477
to have an install option
and a header of your site.

00:21:41.477 --> 00:21:44.480
For some apps, this will
be a clear and obvious win,

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.870
and for other apps, it would
be completely inappropriate.

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:49.640
That will really depend
on your use case.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.810
You may want to use an
icon instead of text,

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:54.310
if you want to make this action
button a little bit smaller.

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.410
And you might also want
to consider selectively

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:59.060
promoting only to users
that have engaged with you.

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:01.390
So for example,
could be only shown

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:04.597
to signed in users who clearly
have an interest in what

00:22:04.597 --> 00:22:06.430
the product or service
that you're offering.

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.890
This is an example of adding an
install prompt to the hamburger

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:12.910
menu.

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:15.100
The great thing about
using the menu here

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.900
for promoting your
web app install

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.705
is that there's
already a strong signal

00:22:18.705 --> 00:22:20.830
that the user is interested
in what you're offering

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:22.370
by clicking on the menu.

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:24.640
And I hope that this
is obvious, but you

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.910
don't want to block access to
any important functionality

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:29.830
in your app with
the promotion here

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:32.110
or anywhere else
for that matter.

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:33.700
You want to make
sure that it doesn't

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:37.180
overlay anything or
clutter up the menu design

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.120
or in any way take precedence
over the other actions

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:44.760
that the user might want to
take by clicking on that menu.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:48.050
Here's an example of promoting
install via a landing page.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:51.200
And landing pages are explicitly
about marketing your product

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.080
or service, and so this is
really your one opportunity

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.630
to go crazy, be as
big as you want.

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.660
But just keep in mind that
all the usual best practices

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:02.190
for creating a good landing
page are going to apply here.

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:04.130
In particular, the
most essential thing

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:05.960
about your landing
page is that the user

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.180
understands what the value
proposition that you're

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.230
offering them is.

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:11.960
If your install pattern is
getting in the way of that,

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.810
then chances are you're going
to lose both the potential user,

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:16.670
and you're certainly
not going to encourage

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:17.712
them to actually install.

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.320
Here's an example of
an in feed pattern

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.740
for promoting PWA install.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:26.400
And feed cards are very common
these days in many types

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.630
of apps, including in social
and news, e-commerce--

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:34.200
basically anywhere where there's
a lot of vertical scrolling

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.950
and chunked information.

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:38.990
Don't show this
promotion too often.

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:40.910
And if a user
dismisses the card,

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:46.200
please remember and respect
the user's choices here.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.420
Every app's use case is
a little bit different,

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:51.270
but there's almost
always some key moment

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:53.430
of engagement in
the journey when

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:57.030
you know that the user is truly
interested and understands

00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:58.680
what it is that you're offering.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.200
And that's a great moment to
ask if they want to reconnect

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.540
with you in the near future.

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.140
The usual rules apply here.

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:08.010
You want to always focus
on the benefit to the user

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:10.290
and use the context
of the key moment.

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:13.270
In this example, the user's
just finished a game.

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:15.190
It's a great
opportunity to say, hey,

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:16.980
do you want to play
again really easily?

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:18.897
You can find this again
from your home screen.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:24.640
So let's recap on
the principles here.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.310
Don't be annoying.

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:28.630
Your users came to your
site to get something done.

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:30.660
If you interrupt
that flow or make it

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.830
in any way difficult for
them to get the task done

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:34.870
that they came to
your site for, chances

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:36.490
are they're just
going to leave and go

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:38.500
get it done somewhere else.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.480
Information architecture
is your friend

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.820
for figuring out
what belongs where,

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.850
and that includes for
promoting install.

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:48.760
Second, remember that if
the user doesn't benefit,

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.320
you shouldn't be promoting it.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.120
And finally, do use
the context where

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:56.470
is the user in their journey
to help the user understand

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:59.870
what they're actually going to
get out of installing your app.

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:01.660
If you want to
learn more, you can

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:05.050
search through the fundamental
site with a query Promoting

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:07.520
Install.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.640
Now, investing in a
great PWA and making

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.580
that PWA installable
does have big benefits

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:15.490
for user engagement.

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:17.650
To talk about these
benefits in practice,

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:20.810
Mukund, a Product Manager
for OYO Consumer Experience,

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:22.832
is going to join us
on stage and talk

00:25:22.832 --> 00:25:24.290
about the impact
installability has

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:25.910
had for them and their team.

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:27.800
As a little bit
of background, OYO

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.660
is the world's second
largest hotel chain,

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:33.590
and it has a presence in
more than 80 countries.

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:36.590
It has more than 23,000 hotels.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:39.710
And with the rapid growth,
they have basically

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:42.800
pursued mobile web as
a key demand channel.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.820
So today, Mukund's going
to take you through all

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:46.820
that's happened with their
mobile web experience

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.445
and how they've grown
in the last year.

00:25:48.445 --> 00:25:49.836
Please welcome Mukund.

00:25:49.836 --> 00:25:53.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.930
MUKUND LADDHA: Thank you, Peter.

00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:57.730
Hi.

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:58.550
I'm Mukund.

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:01.880
I am Product Manager for
OYO Consumer Experience.

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.820
And I'm super excited
and delighted to share

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:08.900
the journey of OYO mobile
web, as well as how focus

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:12.150
on this channel led to
rich results for us.

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:16.910
So if we talk about the growth
that we saw in OYO mobile web,

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:18.980
we can talk about three
major interventions

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:20.390
that were brought about.

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:23.180
First was PWA.

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:26.420
This was followed by the
capability as well as

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.540
adoption of browser installs.

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:34.160
Finally, the integration of TWA,
that is Trusted Web Activities,

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.010
really led to rich
results for us.

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:39.920
With each of these
key interventions

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:43.790
we were able to see good,
sizable lift in conversion,

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:46.520
as well as key
capability increase.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:51.530
Also, our product was made more
accessible to the end users.

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:54.890
Let me take you through each of
these interventions one by one.

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:02.290
PWA was the first major
intervention for us.

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:05.110
It provided users with
key UX capabilities,

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:07.000
like offline
support, reliability

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.150
on different networks, which
was especially important for us,

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:16.210
given the markets we were
present in, and also better

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:17.500
latency.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:21.110
Overall, we saw a conversion
lift of around 2.2X,

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:24.730
while our user base
also rose by 4X.

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:27.170
We saw a latency
rise of almost 75%.

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:33.710
Our product was optimized
leaps and bounds.

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:36.160
And this was one of the
first major breakthroughs

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.610
which really made us
believe in OYO mobile web.

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:42.320
With an already optimized
product in our hands,

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.920
we were looking to make it more
and more accessible to the end

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.160
users.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:50.283
This is where the capability
of browser installs

00:27:50.283 --> 00:27:51.200
came into the picture.

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:56.330
From browser installs,
users were already

00:27:56.330 --> 00:28:00.560
converting by around
2X as compared to PWA.

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.720
Having these metrics
[? insight, ?] we

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.820
were actually looking to
increase its adoption.

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:09.140
This is where we started
doing a lot of A/B experiments

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:13.400
around how to have nudges
across user journeys.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:18.290
We started making nudges on
home pages and [INAUDIBLE] pages

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:22.380
in which we saw adoption
increase of around 1.5X,

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:26.520
whereas we did not see any
drop in PWA conversion.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.950
Finally, this May,
we released OYO Lite,

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:34.740
which was built on
Trusted Web Activity.

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:39.600
It was a major breakthrough in
the world of OYO mobile web.

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.670
Users were starting
to get access

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:46.420
to OYO PWA on Play Store,
which was really cool.

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:49.390
The numbers since
have been incredible.

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:53.610
We have a similar rating on OYO
Lite as compared to native app.

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:57.240
This showcases the importance
of core capabilities

00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:00.660
like low size, easy
over the air updates,

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:04.170
deep linking support,
full screen, and a lot

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:07.180
of other capabilities.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:11.350
Overall, we were seeing a
conversion lift of 3X as

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:14.740
compared to PWA,
and our conversion

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:18.270
was similar to the native app.

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:21.420
To summarize, each of
these interventions

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:26.400
has brought about a good
growth in our channel.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:31.110
From [? M site ?] to PWA, our
conversion has risen by around

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:34.440
6.6X, which is incredible.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:38.250
Mobile web has been the highest
growing demand channel for OYO

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:39.570
over the past few months.

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:42.480
And we have undoubtedly
benefited from all the three

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:46.480
interventions and got a
great [INAUDIBLE] out of it.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.738
Thank you.

00:29:47.738 --> 00:29:51.126
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:53.797 --> 00:29:55.380
PJ MCLACHLAN: Thanks
so much everyone.

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:57.990
Just to invite you to
come on by the sandbox.

00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:59.840
We'll be there most
of the day tomorrow.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.800
And our Twitter handles
are right up here.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.020
So do please reach
out to us if you

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:05.700
have any questions,
any feedback,

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.160
or feel like a good
public shaming.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:11.510
