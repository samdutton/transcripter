ADRIANA JARA: My
name is Adriana Jara.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.830
I'm a Developer
Advocate in Chrome OS.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.180
I will share five tips to
make your PWA stand out

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.100
in a good way.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.800
Earlier this year, I was a
developer on a progressive web

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.900
app here at Google.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.610
And in the beginning,
our users had

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.910
a lot of questions about PWA.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.620
How do you install a website?

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.500
What happens if you don't
install it right away?

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.870
What happens when
you're offline?

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.420
How does it manage
local resources?

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.830
These are the lessons I learned
from answering their questions.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.870
Hopefully, they'll help
you build an experience

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.820
your users will love.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.190
Here we go.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.970
Number one, dare to be offline.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.770
When a user is
offline, they don't

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.800
expect to be able
to get to a website,

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.520
let alone enjoy any
of its features.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.240
As a developer, you might even
be convinced that your app just

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.240
doesn't make sense offline.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.960
And because a PWA requires
an offline experience,

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.360
you can create a
custom page that

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.590
asks users to come back later
when there is a connection.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.370
Instead, how about creating
different features?

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.340
You can't give users
full functionality,

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.950
but some parts could still work.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.770
With the use of device
storage and caching,

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.670
for example, users can't
get to the latest posts,

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.540
but they could interact with
previously retrieved posts.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.940
They could comment
and add reactions.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.540
You can save those interactions
locally and see them later

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.310
when they are back online.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.450
Random searches are impossible.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.210
But if you have
cached recent results,

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.570
they answer they are
looking for may be there.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.410
The result?

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.610
Happy user.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.280
And you didn't even
need the internet!

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.320
By the way, since
you don't know when

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.630
a user is going to
be offline or when

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.480
the phone is going
to be turned off,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.120
it's a good practice to
save snapshots in workflows

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.490
so that the users don't
lose a lot of work

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.100
in case of an interruption.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.669
Number two, use
device storage wisely.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:12.210
On the web, our apps seem
to have unlimited storage.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.580
But in a device, it's
a different story.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.500
There are hard limits.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.380
Keep tabs on how much
space is available.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.210
You don't want your
app to just stop

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.270
working in the middle
of recording a video.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.170
You can use Storage Manager
to calculate available space,

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.370
and then show the user warnings
so they can take action.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.300
Also, choose wisely which method
is more appropriate to save

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.530
the local data.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.470
Some options are cached API--

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.750
which, by the way, can
be accessed directly

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.520
from the window object.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.920
It doesn't need to go
through a service worker.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.180
IndexedDB.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.130
A good use case
here are operations

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.420
that need a transaction or
the native file system API.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.110
It is not fully available yet,
but you can start to experiment

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.230
with it.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.920
Check out the link in the
description for more info.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.830
Also, don't keep local
data longer than necessary.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.860
Once you can sync the
data to the cloud,

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.200
free up space in the device.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.690
And clear all local data when
appropriate-- for example,

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.360
when the user signs out.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.190
Number three, embrace
multi-device journeys.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.560
Users have multiple devices.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.250
They jump from one another
and pick up where they left.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.580
At least, that is
their expectation.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.640
As users, we want to start
a task on our computer

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.540
and send it to our phone to
be continued, and vice versa.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.390
It is pretty convenient to
take a picture with our phone.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.970
But also, a big
screen and a keyboard

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.100
are nice to edit photos
and type captions.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.320
Another example is
content consumption.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.200
We consume content on our
phone in a different way

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.820
than we do on a larger screen.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.730
Users want to be able
to take advantage

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.650
of the real estate
that is available

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.860
and consume content in the most
efficient and enjoyable way

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.220
for them.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.250
Building different
layouts also helps

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.440
with making your app more
accessible and inclusive.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.820
Your users know that no matter
what device they're using,

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.460
your app will provide the
appropriate experience

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.060
for their journey across
different form factors.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.050
Number four, bring
your users with you.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.840
Progressive web apps
are still new for users.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.790
They might not realize
they have landed

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.670
on a website with
special capabilities.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.180
Help them along the way.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.240
Prompt your users to install
your app when it is convenient.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.480
For a while, we used the
browser's default prompt.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.450
Unfortunately, it would
interrupt our users

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.080
in the middle of our
getting started flow.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.690
The prompt would go
away, and users would

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.910
forget to install our app.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.000
Now, you can capture the
before install prompt event

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.360
and prompt the users
at a later time.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.060
You can use headers,
banners, menus, and others.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.040
I added a link to an article in
the description that walks you

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.150
through different patterns.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.270
You can also help your users
by adding tips in your UI

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.030
the first time they
go through a workflow.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.320
You can highlight things like
what data will be available

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.540
offline or what
parts of your app

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.340
will work in the background.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.590
Finally, don't ask
for permissions

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.740
until the user is trying
a specific feature.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.110
Don't ask for camera
access until the user

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.000
is going to take a picture.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.390
This makes the user understand
why you need permissions,

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.060
and they will be more
willing to grant them.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.720
Number five, beware
of service workers.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.120
Service workers are
powerful and are

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.000
central in implementing
several of my tips.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.250
For example, you can
use background sync

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.020
to upload large amounts of data.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.020
Even when the app
is closed, they also

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.630
make possible to make
good use of notifications

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.820
and re-engage your users.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.490
Maybe to remind your
users of unfinished task

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.410
or of new content.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.930
However, service
workers can be tricky.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.580
The best approach
is to generate it.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.720
There are tools
like Workbox that

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.380
can help you generate a service
worker with the strategies

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.010
your app needs.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.720
Finally, keeping your service
worker code to a minimum

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.240
will also make your
app easier to test.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.510
This way, you'll
implement behaviors

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.000
in helper classes that
can be better unit tested.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.450
Thank you for watching.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.070
I hope you got some new ideas
to make your PWA give users

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.340
the best of the web
and native experiences.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.080
I included links
in the description

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.720
to help you
implement these tips.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.090
