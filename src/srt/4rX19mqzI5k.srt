THOMAS STEINER: Hi, folks.

00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:01.655
My name is Tom.

00:00:01.655 --> 00:00:03.853
And today, I want to
talk about Dark Mode.

00:00:03.853 --> 00:00:06.270
I'm not sure when you have
entered the world of computing,

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.930
but for me, it was during
the dark era of MS DOS.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:10.800
And you know what?

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.480
We've actually gone full
circle with Dark Mode.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.590
If you've used a computer
in the 1970s or 1980s,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.390
you probably have
used Dark Mode before.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.270
Well, Dark Mode became a thing.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.820
At that time, when screens
oftentimes were monochrome

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.000
and color screens
incredibly expensive,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.490
Dark Mode wasn't a
choice but simply a fact.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.800
Only when color monitors
became more affordable

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.010
and what you see is what you
get desktop publishing evolved,

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.900
the idea of making
a virtual document

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.590
resemble its physical printed
end product became popular.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.830
And this baseline assumption of
dark text on light background

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.500
was carried over to the very
first, earliest web designs.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.660
The output of those
heavy cathode ray tube

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.010
monitors with
massive desktop PCs

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.370
that we consume these very
first web pages on is long over.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.320
And nowadays, more
often than not,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.110
we use mobile devices
with light LCD displays

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.050
or AMOLED screens that also have
enabled completely new usage

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.340
patterns.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.060
For example, I often browse
the web while in bed.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.630
And because it's
easier on my eyes

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.940
and less likely to
wake up my better half,

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.287
I tend to turn on my
phone's Dark Mode.

00:01:14.287 --> 00:01:16.620
I've done some user research
on why people use Dark Mode

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.360
and under which circumstances.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.190
The results are
pretty interesting.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.050
While the majority
of the surveyed users

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.660
unsurprisingly said Dark
Mode was easier on the eyes

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.850
and just looked
beautiful and elegant,

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.340
the third most mentioned
reason for using Dark Mode

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.810
was that it consumes
less energy.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.150
The Android team
have looked into this

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.930
and found out that
on AMOLED screens,

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.710
Dark Mode can save
up to 60% energy.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.700
This is why on Android Q,
when Battery Saver kicks in,

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.900
we automatically
activate Dark Mode.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.580
And finally, some
people say they

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.310
require Dark Mode as a
true accessibility tool,

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.440
without which they can't
get their work done.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.170
Interestingly, Dark Mode usage
correlates less than expected

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.150
with the surrounding
ambient light situation,

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.140
meaning a lot of people, like
me, use Dark Mode permanently.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.630
So how do you activate Dark
Mode in the first place?

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.389
On Mac OS, it's a setting
in the System Preferences

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:09.680
in the General section.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.650
On iOS and iPAD OS, you can
toggle Dark Mode in Settings

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.960
in the Display and
Brightness section.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.510
On Android, Dark Mode
is called Dark Theme.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.010
And you can activate
it in Settings

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.510
in the Display section.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.910
For Windows, Dark Mode can
be activated in Settings

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.220
in the Colors dropdown menu in
the Personalization section.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.700
And finally, for the
various Linux distributions,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.500
activating Dark Mode
typically involves

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.710
setting a dark desktop theme.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.508
Now that we know how
to enable dark Mode,

00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:36.050
let's see how we
can actually support

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.700
Dark Mode on our web pages.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.680
The secret is a user
reference media feature

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.450
called prefers-color-scheme.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.220
It has three possible values--

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.010
dark, light, and no preference.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.990
The simplest possible
Dark Mode implementation

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.870
is to just invert the background
and the foreground color

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.387
in the case the user
prefers Dark Mode.

00:02:53.387 --> 00:02:55.970
You can see how the page reacts
when I toggle the MAC OS color

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.490
theme between light and dark.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.770
Switching the entire operating
system's color scheme

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.120
can get really annoying.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.640
So in Chrome Dev
Tools, we now allow

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.650
you to emulate the user's
preferred color scheme.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.480
So back to the
theme [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.025
While it works, already
in this basic example,

00:03:11.025 --> 00:03:12.650
you can see how in
practice, things are

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.630
a lot more complex than that.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.850
The default purple user
agent stylesheet color

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.340
of a visited link has a
contrast ratio of only 1.9,

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.780
which isn't enough.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.260
We can fix this by
adding some [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.090
And now it slowly
starts to look OK.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.740
But you can see
where this is headed.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.380
For a production website,
we'd have hundreds or even

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.780
thousands of cases like this
that we'd need to cover.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.590
So rather than one by one,
we need something better,

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.800
semantic color definitions.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.940
You can do this
with CSS variables.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.110
So instead of using hardcoded
colors on the various elements,

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.510
we use variables like text
color or background color

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.490
and then define these
variables dynamically

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.580
based on a preferred
color scheme.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.980
As I said before, we're
ready for the toy example.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.520
We need quite some CSS and even
more for production web apps.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.670
But here's the thing--

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.310
if you have Dark
Mode enabled, you

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.460
shouldn't be forced to load CSS
that is only relevant in Light

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.175
Mode and vice versa.

00:04:09.175 --> 00:04:10.800
You can deal with
this by splitting out

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.200
CSS into three files, dark.css
that contains all the Dark Mode

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.459
relevant CSS variable
definitions, light.css that

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.649
contains all the Light
Mode relevant CSS variable

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:24.610
definitions, and style CSS that
contains the common CSS where

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.280
these variables are being used.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.170
Like that, they make sure that
in the critical rendering path,

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.780
only the CSS that's needed
for the preferred color scheme

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.600
gets loaded with the highest
priority and the rest

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.138
with the lowest priority.

00:04:36.138 --> 00:04:38.680
If you have to deal with older
browsers that don't understand

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.390
the prefers color
scheme media query yet,

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.280
we require one last trick
to make sure the default

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.240
CSS, for example,
light.css gets downloaded

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.640
with highest priority.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.610
Therefore, we manually insert
the light.css stylesheet

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.640
with the good old
insertAdjacentHTML method

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.970
to force its download
with the highest priority.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.182
The obvious [INAUDIBLE]
is to make it work even

00:05:00.182 --> 00:05:02.390
on browsers that are only
compatible with [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.010
script 5.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.540
All right.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.550
With all of this out of
the way, let's have a look

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.410
at how you can actually
design for Dark Mode

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:09.970
and what to keep in mind.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.730
As we've seen before, getting
all the contrasts right,

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.560
making sure the design
conveys concepts

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.320
like elevation in both
light and dark themes

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.480
and still incorporating
your brand's colors

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.360
and accent colors
is incredibly hard.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.580
Material design can help
your design team bootstrap

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.340
a design that respects all
the best practices material

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.660
has established.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.930
On material.io, you can find a
number of resources, including

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.000
a code lab to get you started.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.460
One last tip-- remember
that not everyone who

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.830
has Dark Mode activated
on their operating system

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.680
necessarily wants
websites to be dark too.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.420
It is a nice gesture
to provide users

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.220
with a Dark Mode
toggle for your site

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.710
that initially respects
people's prefers-color-scheme

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:48.340
preference.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.540
But then, I'll ask them to
temporarily or even permanently

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.540
override it.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.150
You can easily support this
use case with a custom element

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.720
that we've developed right for
this purpose, dark-mode-toggle.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.210
All you need to do is load
the custom element script

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.800
and then include
it on your page.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.510
You can find out more about
this custom element on GitHub.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.980
And with that, thank you
very much for watching.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.190
You can find links to all
the features, articles,

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.950
and code samples from this
video in the description.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.720
See you next time,
and enjoy Dark Mode.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.170
