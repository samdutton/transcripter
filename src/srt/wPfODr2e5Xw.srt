SAM DRAZIN: Hi.

00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.180
I'm Sam Drazin from
the Chrome XR team.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.980
We work on advancing
the web to power

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.600
compelling virtual, mixed, and
augmented reality experiences.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.125
Google is committed to
growing the immersive web.

00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:14.250
And we believe that immersive
computing and the web

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.840
complement each other.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.605
The web excels at
providing information

00:00:18.605 --> 00:00:20.730
you didn't know you needed
right until you need it,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.800
like how to fix a leaky sink.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.660
Even if you installed
an app for this,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.810
you'd likely uninstall it
as soon as you were done.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.060
Situations where immersive
experiences shine

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.549
are often ephemeral or sporadic.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.290
You might not buy
a sofa very often,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.050
but when you do it likely
helps to see how big it is

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.960
or whether it will
fit your room's decor.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.290
The web empowers users to
explore and discover easily,

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.260
and in the moment without
the burden of installation.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.750
In addition, the web
also unifies hardware

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.050
and ecosystems.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.210
It runs on laptops, phones,
desktops, even cars.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.180
For XR hardware, like
virtual reality headsets,

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.270
there are already numerous
siloed app ecosystems

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.019
that exclusively cater to their
respective hardware platforms.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.300
The web unifies these
device ecosystems

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.540
under one common XR
platform, while also serving

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.200
foreign factors like smartphones
and augmented reality headsets.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.020
The web provides a clear
path to broadly access

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.780
users, devices, and ecosystems.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.210
That, in conjunction
with compelling use cases

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.130
that are best
served ephemerally,

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.727
has driven us to push the
immersive web forward.

00:01:25.727 --> 00:01:27.810
And we have some exciting
updates and user stories

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.400
to share.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.130
Last year at CDS, we previewed
the WebXR device API,

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.300
an imperative API that enables
web developers to create

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.470
VR experiences for tethered
and mobile VR systems.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.570
We're excited to
announce that the core VR

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.090
capabilities of the
WebXR device API

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.720
are available now
in Chrome 79 beta.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.350
Next month, we will ship WebXR
in Chrome Stable in the 79

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.820
release.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.950
We're ecstatic to be
joined by other browsers,

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.860
like Firefox Reality
and Oculus Browser, who

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.160
will also be shipping WebXR
before the end of the year.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.700
This solidifies the foundation
for VR within the web platform,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.210
completing what WebVR
started years ago.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.750
Three.js continues to be a
flagship library in simplifying

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.260
and extending access for web
developers to 3D programming.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
Version 110 and later
feature important updates

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.545
to its WebXR
support, taking care

00:02:21.545 --> 00:02:22.920
of the heavy
lifting with regards

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.530
to rendering and
controller inputs.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.230
For enhanced testing and
debugging of immersive VR

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.050
experiences, a WebXR
emulator extension

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.390
was created by Mozilla.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.920
This extension
enables developers

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.950
to test WebVR experiences
from their desktops

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.710
with selectable XR
hardware emulators.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.420
Another announcement
we made last year

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.360
was the introduction of
model-viewer, a web component

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.290
that makes it easy to embed
interactive 3D models to view

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.410
on the web and in AR.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.230
Since then, we've added
features, such as advanced

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.160
controls to access and position
the camera, animation support,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.740
and integrations to
view models in 3D

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.960
and AR via Quick Look on iOS
and Scene Viewer on Android.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.870
It's been exciting to see
XR making waves on the web,

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.270
empowering developers
to innovate and address

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.130
real market needs.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.630
Let's hear from a
few companies that

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.152
have applied some of these
tools to their sites.

00:03:19.152 --> 00:03:20.610
DANIEL BEAUCHAMP:
In the past year,

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.740
we've made it possible
for our merchants

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.220
on our platform to upload
and manage 3D models

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.010
and to feature them on their
online store in the same way

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.080
that images and video work.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.990
Now shoppers can see
products in a whole new way.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.870
They can zoom in and zoom
out and rotate the product

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.770
to see it in any angle they want
down to the smallest detail.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.380
And the best part is they
can tap the augmented reality

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.440
button to see what that product
looks like in their home,

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.800
see it outside, even see
if it fits in their car.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.540
And the results
have been amazing.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.070
Shoppers are up
to 2 and 1/2 times

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.340
more likely to buy when
interacting with 3D models

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.303
because they're more confident
in what it is they're buying.

00:03:59.303 --> 00:04:00.970
JESSICA VANDERLELIE:
La Trobe University

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.300
is actively investing in the
future of university life.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.780
Working with XHQ
and Google on WebXR,

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.120
we are seeking to unlock
the university experience

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.580
to students and the
community everywhere,

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.110
irrespective of time, location,
or technology platform.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.070
We've began with the
construction of buildings

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.079
in the physical
world and embarking

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.960
on exciting opportunities
to build a virtual world.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.510
We see the incredible
potential for technology

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.730
to enhance an
augment student life.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.280
AMIT SION: Our focus
with XHQ is to create

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.070
an immersive experience
for the community.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.220
With this project, we started
by creating augmented reality

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.040
and virtual reality apps
to engage the students

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.022
with the university.

00:04:41.022 --> 00:04:42.980
SAM DRAZIN: There have
been great strides taken

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.820
towards realizing
the immersive web,

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.180
but this is only
just the beginning.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.250
Here is what you
can expect next.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.270
Through the W3C immersive
web community group,

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.370
AR incubations within
WebXR are ongoing

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.350
and have made great
progress, exploring

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.570
features like hit
tests and anchors

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.620
and how they enable powerful
AR experiences for the web.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.280
You can try these experiments
out today in Chrome Canary.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.380
For more information, check
out github.com/immersive-web/.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.450
As a part of the gamepad's
module spec work,

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.790
a registry of controllers
is being developed

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.530
to provide more
detailed information

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.320
about the capabilities
and layouts of controllers

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.540
for XR hardware systems.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.180
This includes providing
free-to-use rigged

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.510
3D models of known controllers,
which will enable sites

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.490
to dynamically load
controllers that

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.060
match what the user is holding
for a variety of systems.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.334
For more information, check out
github.com/immersive web/webxr

00:05:38.334 --> 00:05:39.870
input profiles.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.420
For model-viewer, we plan to
ship version 1.0 in early 2020

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.790
with noteworthy improvements,
including support

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.360
for Draco encoded models,
support for soft and real time

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.360
shadows, and integrating
animations from interaction

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.170
prompts.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.890
For more information,
check out modelviewer.dev.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.110
The future of the
immersive web is bright.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.110
And we're hoping you'll enjoy
exploring the possibilities.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.700
If you're interested
in learning more

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.700
