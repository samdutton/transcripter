[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.160
DEV GOGATE: So growing up,
I wanted to be a rock star--

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.860
literally, a rock star.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.820
I dreamt of being a
guitarist in a rock band.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.530
Now, due to lack of talent,
amongst other things,

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.200
that career move
didn't work out for me.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.520
And that's OK.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.200
But you make up for it.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.270
I did dress as my favorite
guitarist during Halloween.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.759
Does anybody recognize
who I'm dressed as?

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:32.259
Yeah?

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.100
A few of you.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.410
All right, that's awesome.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.170
Now, I was born in
India and grew up

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.760
listening to a lot of
music and a lot of bands.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.120
But growing up, I never had
the opportunity or the means

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.930
to see any of my
favorite bands play live.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.940
So I listened to a
lot of their music

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.230
through conventional means,
tapes, radio, CDs, and so on,

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.890
and so forth.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.640
But I always wished I could
see my favorite band live.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.570
Now, fast forward, and just a
few years ago, my favorite band

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.290
reunited.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.990
And I was able to
see them in concert.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.046
And man, what an
experience that was.

00:01:11.046 --> 00:01:14.630
I was all the way up in the
front yelling at the band.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.840
And it was the most beautiful
thing in the world for me.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.760
But that got me thinking,
what if watching a band

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.400
live at the concert
was the only way for me

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.920
to get exposure to their music?

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.560
Could I have discovered the
music back home in India?

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.770
Now the beauty of music is that
the original song once recorded

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.770
by the artist is available
in many different formats

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.583
and over devices.

00:01:41.583 --> 00:01:43.250
And you can listen
to your favorite song

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.850
whether you are working out,
you are cooking, or driving.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.110
So in short, as a listener, I
don't have to go to the music

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.930
unless I want to.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.750
The music is available
to me wherever I am.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.630
And in the same fashion, being
able to deliver amazing web

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.780
content to your user
wherever the user is,

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.762
that's leveraging
the power of the web.

00:02:07.762 --> 00:02:09.220
And we'll dive into
these concepts.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.930
So 30 years ago, exactly to this
day-- which is November 12th--

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.930
Tim Berners-Lee, the man
who would go on to develop

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.280
the worldwide web--

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.580
he published a proposal
for linking and accessing

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.360
information over a
shared interface.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.340
His proposal was to build a
web of hypertext documents

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.570
that could be
viewed on a browser.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.735
Now I remember my first
experience using a browser.

00:02:39.735 --> 00:02:41.950
It was a simple process.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.360
You sat in front of a computer,
you fired up the browser,

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.030
you typed up the destination
URL, and you hit Enter,

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.665
and you got to your destination.

00:02:49.665 --> 00:02:51.540
And then when you wanted
to do something else

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.450
or access some other site,
you followed the same process

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.160
all over again.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.810
It was a deliberate, simple,
and very linear process.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.220
And even if as
devices have changed

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.620
and we now carry mobile devices
that can browse the web,

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.710
the idea of going to a
browser on your device

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.430
is pretty much the same.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.210
But technology and user behavior
has changed quite a bit.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.890
Now today, the browser isn't the
only way to access the internet

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.648
or connect your users
to your website.

00:03:25.648 --> 00:03:27.690
And we are in such an
exciting age for developers

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.480
with so many new
devices and ways

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.650
to engage with your users--

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.550
all the way from tablets,
to desktops, to phones,

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.750
to newer interactive
methods like the Assistant.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.590
So thanks to the omnipresence
of all these computing devices

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.270
around us, we have entered
an era of ambient computing.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.280
And so the devices aren't the
center of attention anymore.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.260
It's the user.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.040
It's you and me.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.630
So how does web development
evolve to address this shift?

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.400
And just like in
my concert example,

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.620
it's unrealistic to expect
that the band is going

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.370
to rerecord their music every
single time a new content

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.390
format or a new device
shows up in the market.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.110
But before we go ahead, let me
just give a quick introduction.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:19.240
My name is Dev Gogate.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.420
I've been at Google
for 10 years.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.980
And I lead a team of web
solution consultants.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.040
And we work with
developers like yourself

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.180
to build engaging web
experiences using the latest

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.390
modern web tech.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.900
And it's really
amazing to see some

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.610
of the things our
partners have built,

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.100
the way they have completely
transformed the way you

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.580
buy movie tickets online,
buy flowers online, or listen

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.050
to music online--

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.820
all using the power of the web.

00:04:48.975 --> 00:04:50.350
So what are the
underlying powers

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.960
of the web that make it
so effective in today's

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.950
environment?

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.820
So I'm here to talk about how
the web can be a key building

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.510
block for building immersive
user experiences based

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.120
on its primary four superpowers.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.248
The web is capable, it's
interoperable, it's imbeddable,

00:05:09.248 --> 00:05:10.540
and it's highly transformative.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.332
And we'll dive into
each of these concepts.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.010
But before we go
any further, it's

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.070
critical to acknowledge that
we learn something completely

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.880
new when we moved
from desktop devices

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.250
and started carrying
handheld devices that

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.770
could browse the web.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.530
We learned that you can't
just be mobile first

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.290
by taking your desktop
content and just resizing it

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.890
for a different screen size.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.280
And this is beside the
obvious performance issues.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.150
Because a user's expectation of
how they interact with the web

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.990
has completely changed.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.420
I mean we started with typing--

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.580
keyboards and mouse, right?

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.830
And with mobile, now we are
all about tapping and swiping.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.880
And now we are on the
cusp of the ambient web,

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.110
with newer interactive patterns
like the Assistant and Voice.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.280
And besides the obvious
performance-related issues,

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.460
as I mentioned earlier,
these new experiences

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.690
lead to a completely
new user expectation.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.260
And a lot of this
is based on how

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.108
the users interact with the
real-life objects around them.

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:16.525
So they expect a
similar response.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.690
However, in my
experience working

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.170
with a lot of our partners,
I feel like the web design

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.380
process still starts
with the assumption

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.740
that the user will
go to a browser

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.370
and then follow the steps that
we have laid out for them.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:40.410
But then if we only think of
website design in this format,

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.500
I think we are drastically
underestimating the impact

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.620
the web can have in our lives.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.200
And we are undervaluing
the complexity

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.640
of a real user's journey.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:57.028
Now, user journeys are
getting increasingly complex.

00:06:57.028 --> 00:06:58.695
And they are actually
a lot more complex

00:06:58.695 --> 00:07:01.560
than any of our analytics
or data shows us.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.990
Now, when we look at
our analytics data,

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.260
we might look at data in
terms of a user's session

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.870
or time spent on our site.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.562
But what is the user doing
in between these sessions?

00:07:12.562 --> 00:07:14.520
Like, how are they even
getting to the website?

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.370
And it's important
to think about that.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.590
Now, research shows
that a digital shopper

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.440
will have almost more than
100 touch points to the web.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.410
And this is right
from the intent

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.240
to purchase
something all the way

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:36.000
through discovery, research, to
the actual process of buying.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.500
So people are no
longer following

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.750
a linear path from awareness
to discovery to purchase.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.060
Now, let's look at
a real-life example.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.820
Now, I talked about my
desire to be a rock star.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.250
So I want to look cool and I
want to buy a Gibson Les Paul

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:58.540
guitar.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.340
So this whole process
of me even thinking

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.640
of buying a guitar to actually
finding the perfect guitar

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.070
to buy, is long.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:07.720
And the journey is perilous.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.320
And it could take me
days, and months, or weeks

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.170
to find the perfect guitar.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:16.240
And the process of
research and discovery

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.440
happens across mobile,
desktop, tablets,

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.710
and could include a combination
of web search, social media

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:28.000
ad, remarketing ads, video
research, and research

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.140
on the retailer website.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.240
Now, let's say at the
end of all of this,

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.120
I find the perfect guitar
that I want to buy.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.019
I go to the retailer's
website and I purchase.

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:40.730
And the journey
doesn't end there.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:44.420
Now, I'm really anxious to get
this guitar right in my hands.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.600
So now I'm tracking
the delivery.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.720
Maybe I'm using the Assistant
to track the delivery.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.660
Or I could use
mobile web to track

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.060
the progress in the delivery.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.670
Now, the guitar shows up and
I get a push notification.

00:09:02.377 --> 00:09:03.710
By the way, the guitar shows up.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.530
That means I'm also
really very excited.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:09.920
Whether it's obvious or
not, a direct browser

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.730
or a version of a Chrome
Custom Tab or a WebView

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:17.600
is part of almost every part
of this journey leading up

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.760
to the event where
the guitar actually

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.040
shows up at my doorstep.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:26.210
And whether it's obvious or not,
the most interesting part here

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.390
is, it's not where I'm
directly going to the browser

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.690
to access the web, it's how the
web creeps out of the browser

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:35.510
and comes to me.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:39.150
So we don't have to
go to the web anymore.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.850
I think the web
comes to us as we

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:45.630
move across devices, services,
and even the Assistant.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.480
So we are in a
post-destination web.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.740
So how did we get there?

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.640
How did this happen?

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.490
So let's look at
the first superpower

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:58.445
of the web, which is, the
web is extremely capable.

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:04.830
We all know that
the web has evolved

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.810
from a collection
of static documents

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.600
to a collection of
highly-immersive experiences.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.660
The web can do it all.

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.790
Whether it's subscribing
to a podcast,

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.300
watching a movie online,
connecting with a friend,

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.910
or just getting the right
information at the right time,

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.870
you can build highly-engaging
experiences and performant

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:27.300
experiences that
do exactly that.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.800
If there's one
company that really

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:36.480
cares about giving their users
great experience, it's Airbnb.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.390
As part of its research,
Airbnb realized

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:44.160
that 65% of its first-time
users land on its mobile web

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.420
experience.

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:50.290
And those same users
expected all the performance

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:52.570
and all the features
of the native app

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:55.040
without having to
download the app.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.140
So Airbnb took this
really seriously

00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:02.232
and invested in rebuilding its
guest experience on the web.

00:11:02.232 --> 00:11:04.190
Now, they're already
seeing some great results.

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:07.520
They're seeing 23% improvement
in conversion rates.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.740
But that's not the
most exciting fact.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:13.040
Now, mobile web is
the primary platform

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.890
that Airbnb designs and
develops for, instead

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:18.650
of it being the last platform.

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:22.040
Which also means they're
pairative with native,

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.950
ensures that the design that
they built for mobile web

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:29.180
can easily be transformed and
transported to other platforms

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.842
like Android and
iOS, thereby reducing

00:11:31.842 --> 00:11:33.050
the overall development time.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.780
At Google, we're
always investing

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.660
to push the boundaries
even further by bringing

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.270
newer technology to the web.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:47.930
TensorFlow.js is a
web-native implementation

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:49.700
of the core machine
learning functionality

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.280
provided by TensorFlow,
which is our software

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.750
tool for deep learning.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:57.900
And this includes many,
many prepackaged solutions--

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.250
let's say to classify images,
to detect objects, detect

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:05.810
body poses, detect language,
and so on, and so forth.

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:10.270
ModiFace, which is a Canadian
augmented reality company,

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:14.150
use TensorFlow.js to build
a beauty product virtual

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.590
try on app for L'Oreal.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.520
And as you can see
from this image here,

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.590
it's highly interactive,
highly engaging.

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:22.580
It's a really good way to
take a real-life use case

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.470
and apply technology
to solve the problem.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.270
Even emerging areas
like augmented reality

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:35.000
and viewing 3D models are
now possible on the web.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.130
Yahoo introduced
a web AR feature

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:41.120
to distribute rich media
content to all its users.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.510
They used the model
viewer web component.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:47.030
And by using that, they
were able to ship a AR

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:52.130
mode with fall back to 3D
for non-supported devices.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:55.730
Even though this is an
early experimentation phase,

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:59.040
Yahoo is already seeing a
huge increase in engagement.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.200
They are seeing
around 10% engagement,

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.280
which is much higher when
compared to non-AR mode.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.520
And they're also seeing a
bump in conversion rates.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.120
So this is, going forward,
going to play a critical role

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.630
in enhancing the e-commerce
experience at Yahoo shopping.

00:13:18.237 --> 00:13:19.820
And if you're willing
to try this out,

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.730
it only takes a few lines
of code to try this out.

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:27.310
And it works across
platforms and frameworks.

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:29.150
So I highly encourage
you to try this out.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:35.290
The second superpower of
the web I want to talk about

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:38.290
is the web's ability to
be interoperable-- or

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:39.800
interoperability.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.270
Now, this speaks to the ability
of the web to really render

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.570
across all types of browsers.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:48.230
This is not a new thing.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:51.730
We already know that a good
web page renders and works

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.890
across all browsers.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:58.250
But from a user's perspective, I
think this is beyond a browser.

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.120
Now your same web
content can render

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.440
in your favorite native app,
on Google Search, or even

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.248
the Assistant.

00:14:07.248 --> 00:14:08.790
So let's look at a
few examples here.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.270
As we have transitioned
to a mobile-first world,

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.360
native apps are
obviously very popular--

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.470
and especially
social media apps.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.310
And one specific format that's
become increasingly popular

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:24.660
is Stories.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.430
For those of you who
don't know, Stories

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:30.480
is a highly-interactive way to
share your experiences online

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.900
by using a combination
of video and images.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.880
And if you're a
verified user, you

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.010
can even add a web
link to your story.

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:41.400
So in a way, your
app now acts like

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.720
a post-destination browser.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.380
And with one swipe up,
you're able to load

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:51.900
your web content embedded within
the app in a Chrome Custom Tab.

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.120
Now, imagine if these
pages were actually built

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.650
for this type of handoff--

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.240
how efficient and
cool this would be.

00:15:00.012 --> 00:15:01.470
Let's look at a
different example--

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:03.720
the Assistant.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.390
One of the amazing things
about the Google Assistant

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:09.540
is, you can now use
your voice to find

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:14.770
interactive or immersive
services and experiences.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.850
And if you want more control
over this experience,

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:21.680
you can even write a dedicated
action like Walmart did.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.460
And as you can see
here on the screen,

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.350
you can search for
objects or things--

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:26.795
in this case, this apple--

00:15:26.795 --> 00:15:28.170
and add it to your
Shopping Cart.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.600
And when your shopping
journey is over,

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.380
you can just click
the link, which

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.570
deep links straight into
their Progressive Web

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:41.665
App at the point of checkout.

00:15:41.665 --> 00:15:46.700
And the Progressive Web App is
hosted at grocery.walmart.com.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.070
And at this point, you
transition to your normal touch

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:53.160
interface and complete
the checkout process.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.970
And this just works.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:56.988
It's the same
URL-supported experience

00:15:56.988 --> 00:15:58.030
that you find on the web.

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:05.430
The Google Lens platform
is an entirely new way

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:10.270
for users to explore what's
around them using the camera.

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:13.260
And this makes a lot of sense
because, let's admit it,

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:19.140
it is hard to type into a search
bar or a URL bar on your phone.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:22.530
We recently partnered with
Netflix and the "New York

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:26.010
Times" for a special Lens
experience in the print

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:28.810
edition of "New York Times."

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.260
And as you can
see in this image,

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.060
there was a printed
ad in the newspaper,

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.550
and when you point
Google Lens at it,

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:38.650
it shows you a digital overlay.

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:40.940
And when you tap
the digital overlay,

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.890
it takes you to additional
content tied to it.

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:45.260
And now, guess what?

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.320
This experience is
powered by the web

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:52.850
and opens up an immersive
page using the physical world

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:55.250
as your virtual URL.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:58.760
And due to the interoperability
of the web content,

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.060
Lens can now immediately
surface your content that's

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.760
tied to a visual anchor point.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.170
So in a way, it's your
same web-hosted content,

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.970
but which can be surfaced
in new and engaging ways.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.829
So let's look at
the next superpower.

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:19.109
The web is embeddable.

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:21.660
In the previous
examples, you end up

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.550
in what looks like a
traditional browsing

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:25.410
experience, which
takes advantage

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:28.180
of the linkability of the web.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:32.120
But what if you want
to embed content?

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.640
So we think of embedding
in really two contexts.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:39.190
What if you want to embed web
content into other platforms?

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:42.110
Or what if you wanted
to bring native content

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:45.050
and embed that into the web?

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:47.708
I'm glad to say, both these
scenarios are possible.

00:17:47.708 --> 00:17:49.250
So let's explore a
few examples here.

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:56.660
Dynamic Mail takes
us to the next level

00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:00.740
by bringing modern tech
like interactive AMP content

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:03.290
into your email client.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:06.980
It provides senders
the ability to provide

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:10.370
expressive and immersive content
and deliver to your email

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:11.240
inbox--

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.580
so much better than
static, boring emails.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:18.450
And as a user, you can now
interact with the content

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:20.590
as if it was a mini app.

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:22.920
So in a way, a
user can now, let's

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:29.010
say, browse through a carousel,
click a link, submit a form,

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:32.460
or click a button, all within
the context of the email,

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.440
and always have
access to the latest

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.210
information in the email.

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:42.620
Now, we always knew
that web content

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.650
could be made available
inside your Android app

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:47.540
through WebViews.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.490
What we are offering
you is a much better way

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:50.282
to do these things.

00:18:50.282 --> 00:18:52.852
So we recently announced
Trusted Web Activities.

00:18:52.852 --> 00:18:54.560
And you've probably
heard about all of it

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.450
over the last two days.

00:18:56.450 --> 00:19:01.490
It lets content creators quickly
integrate existing web flows

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:03.980
and journeys in
a fullscreen mode

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:08.090
within existing Android apps,
with all the performance

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:11.432
and the assistive features
of the Chrome browser.

00:19:11.432 --> 00:19:13.390
As you might remember
from all the other talks,

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:15.310
there are a ton
of other partners

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:20.650
who have experimented with this
and have seen immense value.

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:24.415
Obviously, all of this should
adhere to Play Store policies.

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:31.930
So what about the other
type of embeddability?

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:34.780
Now, if the key
differentiator of the web

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.610
is its power of
distribution, can

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.760
you take native content and
then leverage that power

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.080
to distributed it widely?

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:47.350
And the answer is yes,
using WebAssembly.

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:50.770
WebAssembly lets you run
your high-performance,

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:54.870
low-level code written in
C and C++ and run it within

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:57.670
the browser in a much
more efficient manner.

00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:00.690
And I think, again, you have
learned all about it today.

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:04.620
So WebAssembly also has broad
support across many browsers

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.640
and devices.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.750
So let's look at a few examples.

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:13.890
Now AutoCAD took their
35-year-old code base--

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:16.860
by the way, that is older
than the web itself--

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:21.645
and is now running it in the
browser as a proof of concept.

00:20:21.645 --> 00:20:22.770
And it's going really well.

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:25.410
Now, what an
amazing achievement.

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:27.270
And if, as a web
developer, you're not

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:31.210
that familiar with AutoCAD or
you don't use AutoCAD as much,

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:34.270
you might be familiar with
Figma, which is a software

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:37.840
that you use to design
your web interfaces.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:41.920
Figma has been using WebAssembly
to run their C++ code within

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.550
the browser.

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:45.790
And the biggest
benefit Figma saw

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:48.830
from using WebAssembly
was faster load time.

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.970
In fact, they are
seeing 3x the load time

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:54.355
after they switch
to WebAssembly.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.110
So let's talk about the last
superpower of the web, which is

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:03.120
the web's ability to transform.

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:08.310
Now as we've seen
throughout this talk,

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:11.930
the digital ecosystem is
getting more and more complex.

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:15.090
And it's no longer about
worrying if your page can

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:17.460
render in the browser.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.890
You now have to worry
about platforms, apps,

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:24.347
and new computing surfaces that
all seek for your attention.

00:21:24.347 --> 00:21:25.680
So how do you keep up with this?

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:32.000
And maybe it doesn't make
sense to publish a dedicated

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.470
UI for all of these surfaces.

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:38.770
Your content might be
universal, but your UI

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:42.900
is increasingly custom
to a particular surface.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.680
So it might be interesting
to see how your published end

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.570
points can be seen as
separate entities--

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:53.450
like, let's say, business
logic, content, and UI.

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:55.910
In a typical web page
loaded in a browser

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:59.000
all three are combined to
form the user experience

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.880
that you control.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.300
But you might have noticed that
some of the markup that you use

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:08.188
lets your content
act independently.

00:22:08.188 --> 00:22:09.730
And I'm talking
about structured data

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:13.780
here, which is a way to mark
up your pages so platforms

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.290
like Google can better
understand your content

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:21.820
and can transform
it if necessary.

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:24.730
Now, the end result is that
your web content, which

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:27.730
was previously
coupled with your UI,

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:32.260
can be decoupled and transformed
into a richer UI within, let's

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.790
say, Google Search.

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:37.880
In this example, you can see
snippets, events, and products,

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:41.930
and many more areas shown
here, with a very rich UI that

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:43.820
shows up within Google Search.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:48.350
So in a way, this extends your
presence beyond your core page.

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:54.300
Earlier, we talked about
how the Assistant can become

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.720
a good referrer to your site.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.690
But what if you want to trigger
a quick action before it even

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:02.780
gets to your site?

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:06.400
Now, what's neat about
this ecosystem is that,

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.320
to enable actions on
Google for your content,

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.520
you don't have to create
something from scratch.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:17.290
Because you already mark up your
pages to describe your content,

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:20.150
Google can automatically
generate actions for the Google

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:23.150
Assistant with a corresponding
entry in the Assistant

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:25.280
Directory.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.440
So when users ask
the Assistant for one

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:30.900
of the available content
types, the Assistant

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.120
is able to serve it up easily.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.090
And we are already doing this
for our podcasts, recipes,

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:38.650
and news articles.

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:41.890
And as a site owner, now
you can go to the console

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:45.580
and claim your site
content, knowing

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:47.170
that it has already
been transformed

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:49.188
for use with the Assistant.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:58.510
So as web developers, you
have made huge investments

00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:00.390
in the web platform.

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:02.220
So it's only logical
that you should

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:06.030
be able to leverage this when
new markets or platforms open

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:07.110
up.

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:09.030
And there's a way to do that.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:12.360
Now, recently in India, we
announced the Spot Platform,

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:15.320
which is powered by Google Pay.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.600
A Spot is a digital
front for a business that

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:22.630
is created, branded, and
hosted by the business,

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:25.100
but powered by Google Pay.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.320
Now users can discover
a Spot online or at

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.590
a physical location
by scanning a QR code

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:35.010
and transact with the merchant
safely and securely, all

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:38.050
within the Google Pay app.

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:40.440
Now, the good news
is, a Spot is built

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.110
using HTML and JavaScript.

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:46.410
So as developers, you can
leverage your existing

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:50.340
investments in the web and
transform it into a Spot

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:54.330
by just adding a few
lines of JavaScript code.

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:56.190
Now this makes it
possible for a merchant

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:59.790
to have a truly scalable
solution, while maintaining

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:01.650
the consistency
of your user flows

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:04.120
across different platforms.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.180
And Google is not the only
player who is doing this.

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.700
WeChat lets you do something
similar on their platform

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:10.200
as well.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.080
So to recap the
four superpowers--

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.310
the web is capable.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:22.570
You can do almost anything
with the web today.

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:24.100
The web is interoperable.

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:28.620
You build something once, and
it works almost everywhere.

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:30.360
The web is embeddable.

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.450
You can embed web tech
into native platforms

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:36.250
and bring native to the web.

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:38.220
And the web is transformative.

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.760
Your web content can adapt
and seed new platforms.

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.920
So now that we have discussed
the main superpowers

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:51.850
of the web, here are some
things to ponder and reflect on.

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:55.290
Are you building
high-quality content?

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:58.850
Are you building
highly-performant sites?

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:01.520
Are you taking advantages
of all the capabilities

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.850
that the web has to offer, so
that you are creating the best

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:07.700
experience for your users?

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:11.630
Are you really designing
for a post-destination web?

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:14.090
You know that users are
accessing your site through all

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:16.520
these non-conventional
means, how

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.380
are you ensuring
that your site is

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:21.560
interoperable and embeddable?

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.110
Is your web presence modular?

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:25.610
Are you designing
your site in a way

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:27.770
so that you can
leverage your investment

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:31.377
and apply it across platforms so
when a new technology comes in,

00:26:31.377 --> 00:26:31.960
you are ready?

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:38.290
Now you might leave
CDS today and say,

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:40.440
hey, this is all
great, but I have

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.050
to think of all this technical
debt that I have accumulated

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:45.990
and deal with all these
performance issues.

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:48.910
Now, it's not that different
than the sound engineer

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:52.120
at a concert who has to stare
at this jumble of cables

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.780
and try to make things work.

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:59.460
But I ask that you leave
that aside for a moment.

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:03.630
Just like fans like me
demand an amazing experience

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:08.560
at the concert, we are on
the cusp of the ambient web,

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.950
and our users are demanding
an amazing and immersive web

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:14.170
experience from us.

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:16.720
And as you probably learned
over the last two days,

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:20.098
there's tons of capabilities
and tools that you can leverage.

00:27:20.098 --> 00:27:22.390
And now that you have learned
about all the superpowers

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:25.780
of the web, the
only thing needed

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:29.560
is your creativity
and your imagination.

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.800
So I can't wait to
see what you'll build.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.030
Let's go put on an amazing show.

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:36.470
Thank you.

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:39.520
