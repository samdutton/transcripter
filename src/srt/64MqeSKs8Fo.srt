00:00:07.212 --> 00:00:09.295
CHRIS WILSON: Chrome, I
would hope everyone knows,

00:00:09.295 --> 00:00:11.350
is Google's browser.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.290
This wraps in a bunch of Google
services and user experience

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.250
features.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.800
But Chrome is built on
top of Chromium, which

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.940
is an open source project.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.420
And that core open
source project

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.940
also gets used by a
number of other browsers--

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.690
Edge, Samsung, internet
browser, many others.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.600
Blink is the web platform
engine inside that.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.480
And Blink is built
around the implementation

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.620
of a number of features, open
standards-based web platform

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.590
core features that we've
all known to come and love.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.720
The last bit is one that Yoav
and and I already mentioned,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.530
which is the Web Platform
Incubation Community group.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.600
We usually call this WICG.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.790
We co-chair this along
with Marcos Caceres

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.880
from Mozilla and Travis
Leithead from Microsoft.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.800
And this is the
place where we start

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.495
the journey of a lot of
these collaborative efforts.

00:00:59.495 --> 00:01:01.870
YOAV WEISS: Chromium is a huge
open source project that's

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.490
seeing 90,000 commits
a year from over 2,000

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.430
different contributors
working for 55

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.060
different companies, potentially
with multiple organizations

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.250
inside of each company.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.980
And each one of those parties
have slightly different

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.170
interests.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.540
It's also important to
recognize that a lot

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.330
of those contributions are
coming from Google employees,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.240
but non-Google contributors are
almost 20% of that pie chart.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.850
In order to make sure that
all of those contributions

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.112
from different parties all make
sense, we need an open process.

00:01:38.112 --> 00:01:39.820
CHRIS WILSON: If you've
interacted at all

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.710
with the Chromium
open source project,

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.680
you've probably seen people
talking about intents--

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.140
intents to implement,
intents to ship.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.380
These intents are part of
the Blink process, where

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.090
a set of trusted
Chromium engineers,

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.520
called the API
owners, such as Yoav,

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.230
make sure that the
trade-off is being

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.390
taken into account by
the engineers working

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.740
on different features.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.200
Mozilla has a very
similar process.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.930
Part of our process grew from
the WebKit process as well.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.780
But as part of these
processes, engineers

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.820
need to show that there's
industry agreement

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.310
or backing that the feature
they're trying to ship

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.000
is an important one, and also
that the features' design was

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.530
properly reviewed.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.140
That Blink process is not a
replacement for the standards

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.360
process, but a separate one.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.570
YOAV WEISS: To recap, the
typical journey of an API

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.600
goes from researching
the problem space,

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.330
publishing an explainer
with use cases,

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.740
designing a solution in the
open with interested parties,

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.910
experimenting with
that solution,

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.893
and eventually
shipping it or not.

00:02:40.893 --> 00:02:43.060
CHRIS WILSON: So what we
would like you to take away

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.100
from this talk is,
first, there is

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.520
a difference between Chromium
process and standards process.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.350
They work together,
but they're not

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.120
replacements for each other.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.640
Our intent process is
intended to make it possible

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.022
for us to move the
web platform forward,

00:02:57.022 --> 00:02:58.480
even if we have to
go out on a limb

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.850
sometimes, but also work
together with the standards

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.350
process.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.290
GREG WHITWORTH: And at
Microsoft, we completely agree.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.373
On the move from EdgeHTML
over to Chromium,

00:03:08.373 --> 00:03:10.790
we did a full inventory of
some of the goodness we thought

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.547
was in EdgeHTML and wanted
to bring over to Chromium.

00:03:13.547 --> 00:03:15.630
We reached out to our good
friends over at Google,

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.300
and they completely
agreed, because one

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.842
of the things we wanted to look
into, that we'll be covering,

00:03:19.842 --> 00:03:20.660
is form controls.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.750
And starting up, we were
with accessibility, touch,

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.700
and ultimately a
fresh coat of paint,

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.242
because when we were
looking at them,

00:03:27.242 --> 00:03:29.010
they were pretty
dated as you'll see.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.130
And we'll also be
covering scalability,

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.230
extending functionality,
and then ultimately,

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.480
as Nicole was saying,
new components.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.270
And then we have this
lovely Windows 95

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.147
draggable element here in the
range, which is definitely

00:03:42.147 --> 00:03:43.230
in the need of an upgrade.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.110
So we gave it a more
modern splash coat of paint

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.575
to flatten it up a little bit.

00:03:47.575 --> 00:03:49.700
So hopefully, it looks a
lot better to you as well.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.795
NICOLE SULLIVAN:
And for Chrome, we

00:03:51.795 --> 00:03:53.420
decided to experiment
with a little bit

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.360
of a different visual detail.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.865
We are showing the selected
portion of the range in color.

00:03:57.865 --> 00:03:59.240
We'd love to know
what you think.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.520
This is something we're
still playing with and trying

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.650
to figure out what works well.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.770
GREG WHITWORTH: And checkbox
and radio, they're small,

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.980
but they're also really,
really impactful form controls.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.750
They're on almost
all of our forms.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.490
And while, again,
there's subtle changes,

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.890
those gradients are very,
very indicative of the era

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:16.972
that they came out.

00:04:16.972 --> 00:04:18.680
And we've now flattened,
modernized them.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.990
And hopefully, they fit better
in all of your form controls

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.440
on your websites
that you're making.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.982
NICOLE SULLIVAN: I believe that
you lit the path for us here.

00:04:24.982 --> 00:04:26.060
Thank you.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.920
On Chrome, again, we
decided to experiment

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.350
with color for the
selected state.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.260
So that said, though,
we share about 99%

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.850
of the code for these elements.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.058
And so that's going to make
the next steps that we're

00:04:37.058 --> 00:04:38.490
talking about a lot easier.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.470
GREG WHITWORTH: Another
important aspect,

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.330
as we started off with,
was accessibility.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.830
And one of these
things is it really

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.038
doesn't matter about the
input modality you're using.

00:04:45.038 --> 00:04:47.500
You should be able to use
the control in a good way.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.240
And touch is one of those
things, as you all know.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.850
I've been using the
Macs over at the booth,

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.790
and I keep touching the
touchscreen that isn't there.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.530
We have the 2-in-1
Windows devices,

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.140
and so touch is very
important to us.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.020
And so we increased the hit
test regions on-- here's Date.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.590
But the control, I think, that
shows this the most is the Time

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.200
element, which, as you can see,
here's the current Chromium

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.700
one with those
wonderful little tiny

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.530
spinners that good
luck trying to touch

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.160
those with your fingers.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.940
We now have the similar
pop-up that we have in Date.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.600
And you've got the normal
touch scroll carousel-type feel

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.378
to have a good user experience.

00:05:22.378 --> 00:05:24.170
NICOLE SULLIVAN: So we
wanted to understand

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.530
why form elements are recreated
as sort of a starting point

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.920
for understanding what
we could do differently.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.260
The top 10 form controls that
are recreated by web developers

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.260
are here on this screen.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.670
The top one is Select.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:38.793
GREG WHITWORTH: Shocker.

00:05:38.793 --> 00:05:41.210
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Yeah, I think
we all saw that one coming.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.450
Checkbox, Date, Radio, and
File, and then a few others

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.860
that are used as well.

00:05:48.005 --> 00:05:49.880
SPEAKER 1: For the most
part, we can probably

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.070
agree that most web
developers do not

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.820
build entirely custom
infrastructure and tooling.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.010
Where possible,
developers usually

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.190
prefer to rely on
open source tools.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.050
So one way to improve actual
websites that developers ship

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.930
are to improve the actual
tools that are being

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.720
used to build those sites.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.910
Better open source
tooling can directly

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.390
result in a better web.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:19.160
MDN will soon release the first
edition of their developer

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.530
and designer survey
to try and learn more

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.610
about the needs and
frustrations of web developers.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.140
With over 28,000 responses,
one interesting result

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.500
from the survey was
that 72% of respondents

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.665
actively use React, Angular,
or View for their sites.

00:06:38.665 --> 00:06:40.790
SPEAKER 2: So how should
we invest in the framework

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:46.490
ecosystem to address both
DX and UX challenges?

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.340
We think there's a big
opportunity here for tooling

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.530
to help with both
of these problems,

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.140
in particular, by
bringing good defaults

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.473
and by being opinionated.

00:06:56.473 --> 00:06:57.890
So I'm going to
take a moment here

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.380
to define this notion
of what we decided

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.060
to call a web framework.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.420
It's an end-to-end system
that controls every aspect

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.120
from getting started,
everyday development,

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.590
through deployment.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.800
It's directly positioned
to impact both UX and DX

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.380
by controlling the
server and the client,

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.620
the build and the serve, the
dev and the prod environments.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.030
And this is a core premise
of our work in this space.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.040
Through these web
frameworks, we want

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.940
to enable developers to
successfully build and maintain

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.280
high-quality production apps.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.930
