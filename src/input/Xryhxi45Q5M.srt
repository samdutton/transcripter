00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:08,430
AANCHAL BAHADUR: Hi,
everyone, I'm Aanchal.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,130
And I work on product
partnerships for Chrome.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,620
My job is to evangelize
the web to all of you

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,320
and be an advocate
for your feedback

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,200
as Chrome continues to build
exciting new things that you

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,990
just heard about from
Ben and [? Dion. ?]

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,430
Sure, I play that role.

10
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:28,350
But if you look harder, I really
am the unicorn that all tech

11
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,090
companies are looking to solve.

12
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,549
I'm a millennial.

13
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,760
Happy being friends with
my phone, my laptop,

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,360
my noise cancellation
headphones, Fitbit, Kindle--

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,960
you name it.

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,310
So in this particular
instance, I went on a vacation,

17
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,150
unlike millennials, with my mom.

18
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,210
I grew up in India, and I
go back three times a year

19
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,520
to visit my dog, Rafiki.

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,460
And my family is
usually there too.

21
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,670
And he usually needs to be
held that way 24 hours a day.

22
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,330
And so someone needs to stay
back-- had to be my father.

23
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,140
And so my mother and I drove
up to the hills of Landour.

24
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,170
I know it sounds like a location
from the "Lord of the Rings,"

25
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,320
but it actually is a
town in Northern India.

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,950
And it's famous for great
weather, good desserts,

27
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,940
and after this talk,
for network connections.

28
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,880
So quick show of
hands, how many of you

29
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,140
have experienced
coffee shop Wi-Fi?

30
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,190
Expected.

31
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,530
I, for on-- always looking
for that perfect spot

32
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,080
on a couch in a coffee shop
solving the world's problems

33
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,920
on my laptop.

34
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,480
How about airplane Wi-Fi?

35
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,080


36
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,220
Wow, quite a few of you.

37
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,920
But yeah, definitely more
frustrating than coffee shop

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,740
or conference Wi-Fi.

39
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,660
What about instances when
you've paid for Wi-Fi,

40
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,630
and you've got no Wi-Fi?

41
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,240
Seemed like the entire
population of Landour

42
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,350
was either on 2G
or largely offline

43
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,210
or, like me, pointing
my phone at network

44
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:05,430
towers demanding the internet
like it's my human right.

45
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,050
Even in an offline situation,
the web came to my rescue.

46
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,400
I had offlined a few articles
on the best bakeries in Landour,

47
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,910
how to find more
food in Landour,

48
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,400
and the web came
to my rescue there.

49
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,430
So this map from the Chrome
User Experience Report

50
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,560
shows you 4G densities
across the world.

51
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,060
And it looks like in
the US and some parts

52
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,590
where it's dark
green is really good.

53
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,980
But think about the last time
you were on your commute,

54
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,300
in the BART, or anywhere, on
the train, reliable, fast 4G

55
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,150
is still a privilege.

56
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:42,120
And this isn't really a US
or an emerging-market story.

57
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,720
The web needs to work
for everyone at any time

58
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,010
everywhere.

59
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,690
These instant-loading
experiences for everyone

60
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,870
make the web like
that crucial friend

61
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,070
who's actually there for you
when you need them the most.

62
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,480
But historically,
despite its reach,

63
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,490
the web has not met
user expectations

64
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,290
when it comes to mobile.

65
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,080
A lot of you are
changing that narrative,

66
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,090
are shaping it real-time--
adoption of new web

67
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,520
technologies like Service
Worker are playing

68
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,100
a role in changing this.

69
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,520
Investment in web performance
literally pays off.

70
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,650
These companies
across the world have

71
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,300
been investing in
web performance

72
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,650
and have actually
seen business impact.

73
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,330
LinkedIn Lite saw four times
increase in job applications

74
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,800
by just building
a progressive web

75
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,120
map using caching strategies.

76
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,050
Wayfair, like you just recently
heard from Ben and Dion,

77
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,920
have also seen 10%
conversion increase.

78
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,350
And ClickBus in Brazil is
also seeing sales go up.

79
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,720
So it literally pays off.

80
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,630
So I looked for that exact point
of intersection that lights up

81
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,426
a millennial's brain and
makes them really happy.

82
00:03:49,426 --> 00:03:51,300
And I realized that it
pretty much comes down

83
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,240
to music, coffee, and photos.

84
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,190
Music on Spotify,
coffee from Starbucks,

85
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,490
and photos of the latest fashion
trends or whatever-- dogs,

86
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,210
if you're me--

87
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,100
on Pinterest.

88
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,020
I still remember my
first few conversations

89
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,340
with these companies.

90
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,380
And the people that
I actually spoke to

91
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,050
are here today to tell you
the valuable lessons they

92
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,880
learned building on the web.

93
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,140
It hasn't been easy.

94
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,570
It's taken months and
months of testing--

95
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,420
some failures, some learnings,
but ultimately, they've

96
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,650
all seen business impact.

97
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,750
And we're glad they're
here to share it with you.

98
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,460

ado, please join me

99
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,050

[MUSIC PLAYING]

103
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:39,000


104
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,880
Last year, Spotify had
a burning question.

105
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,170
Would having a mobile web music
player allow us to grow faster?

106
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,340
Today I have the answer, and
I'm here to share it with you.

107
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,170
I'm Matt Rizzo, and
I'm a product manager

108
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,360
at the growth team at Spotify.

109
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,330
As a growth team, our goal
is to drive sustained growth

110
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,650
of users around the world.

111
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,790
Within this greater growth
team, my team's specific focus

112
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,580
is on using the web to
capture and validate

113
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,680
growth opportunities.

114
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,350
Over the next few minutes,
I'll share with you

115
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,740
how we decided if we should
invest in the mobile web

116
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,880
and where we are today.

117
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,300
So let me take you back to 2017.

118
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,820
At this time, there was no
way to listen to Spotify

119
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,320
on mobile web.

120
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,260
We already had a robust
web experience on desktop

121
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,760
that was working on Windows,
Chrome OS, and Mac OS.

122
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,350
But on mobile, we
had no such option.

123
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,460
And frankly, we were
unsure if we should.

124
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,340
Things seemed
pretty good for us.

125
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,640
We had been growing fast.

126
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,430
And our native apps had
impressive retention figures.

127
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,740
But every day,
millions of people

128
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,340
visited our artist, album,
and playlist links on the web.

129
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,960
And we're hit with a wall.

130
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,660
Each one of those users
had to download the Spotify

131
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,670
app to listen to music.

132
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,130
Our hunch was that this
hard-download wall was

133
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,776
hurting our ability to grow.

134
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,775
In fact, it was turning
users away from Spotify.

135
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:04,940


136
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,130
So to explore this
question in more depth,

137
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,260
we headed to Brazil.

138
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,790
Why Brazil?

139
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,160
Well, we saw two things
that were important to us.

140
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,200
One, we had a ton of
web traffic from Brazil.

141
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,791
It was a growth market for us.

142
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:18,290
And--

143
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,290
[TELEPHONE RINGING]

144
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:19,790
Hey.

145
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,610


146
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,040
And a significant amount
of our users in Brazil

147
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,520
had less than a gigabyte of
storage space on their phone.

148
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,410
This left these users
in a constant state

149
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,640
of prioritization.

150
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,070
Should I keep this
app on my phone?

151
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,840
Or should I delete
it to make way

152
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,120
for this app I really
need right now?

153
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,180
So after talking to
more users in Brazil,

154
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,160
we realized this was
a real challenge,

155
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,960
and it was affecting us.

156
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,720
This challenge caused people
to either delete Spotify

157
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,510
or to not download it
in the first place,

158
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,310
effectively, making
it impossible

159
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,067
for them to use
Spotify on their phone.

160
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:58,400
We also learned that there
was another type of user that

161
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,040
could benefit from Spotify--

162
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,890
those who were
unfamiliar with Spotify.

163
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,960
Imagine you've never
heard of Spotify,

164
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,110
and you get a link sent to
you from one of your friends.

165
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,510
You click that link
to listen to a song.

166
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,380
And you end up on a page.

167
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,430
This page prompts you
to download an app.

168
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,490
Downloading an app is
a tall order for you

169
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,390
if you've never even
heard of Spotify.

170
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,710
Why should I download this?

171
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,900
I just want to
hear this one song.

172
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,590
So because of these insights,
we had a strong perspective

173
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,200
that we should have a
mobile web experience.

174
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,080
And there were two users that
we thought we needed it for.

175
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,150
The first is people
with low storage space

176
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,597
who can't download our app.

177
00:07:37,597 --> 00:07:39,555
And the second is people
who don't know Spotify

178
00:07:39,555 --> 00:07:42,300
and are not familiar
enough to actually decide

179
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,980
to download Spotify.

180
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,110
So we started experimenting.

181
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,990
We started experimenting to test
our belief that the mobile web

182
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,370
would unlock growth.

183
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,430
We started really small.

184
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,070
Our first tests were
fast and simple.

185
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,340
What if we gave our existing
traffic, a limited player

186
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,220
from which they could play just
one song, before downloading

187
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,962
the app?

188
00:08:03,962 --> 00:08:05,920
Guess what happened when
we launched this test.

189
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,730


190
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:13,150
We saw first-day
plays increase by 25%.

191
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,320
This was huge.

192
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,600
That was the number of
users who play within 24

193
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,550
hours of visiting our site.

194
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,190
After seeing this, we knew
there was enormous demand

195
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,260
for a mobile web player.

196
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,840
So we took the next step.

197
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,090
Now that we had strong data
to back up our intuition,

198
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,740
we went a step further.

199
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,669
We wanted to test two
universes against each other,

200
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:38,140
one universe in which we had a
mobile web player and then one

201
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,610
in which we didn't.

202
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,200
We wanted to do this
because we wanted

203
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,350
to understand if there would
be an incremental benefit to us

204
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,520
going in and
investing in the web.

205
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,659
So we built a full experience.

206
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:50,950
And this full experience
would allow for more immersive

207
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,210
sessions on the web.

208
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,520
And then we exposed it
to 50% of our visitors.

209
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,070


210
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,350
This experience included
three key Chrome features.

211
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,910
First, the media session
API, and this allowed users

212
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,030
to control playback from
the notification tray;

213
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:11,780
second, PWA install for Quick
Access from the home screen;

214
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,710
and finally, we had
protected content support

215
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:18,496
to ensure artists were
guarded from piracy.

216
00:09:18,496 --> 00:09:19,870
Guess what we saw
from this test.

217
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,060


218
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,540
We saw a 54% increase
in day-one plays,

219
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,260
and even a sustained 14%
increase in active users all

220
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,910
the way through to day 60--

221
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,870
so real retention.

222
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,660
We also learned about
the power of the web

223
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,820
as a reactivation driver.

224
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,250
So 30% of the logins
we were seeing

225
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,560
were coming from users
who had not been active

226
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,480
in the past 28 days.

227
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,291
Our mobile web player was
bringing churned users back

228
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,040
onto the platform.

229
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,780


230
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,550
We had one concern though.

231
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,530
And our concern was that
launching a mobile web

232
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,680
experience would actually
cannibalize our app downloads

233
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,980
and hurt those impressive
retention figures I referenced.

234
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,530
But we've seen the opposite.

235
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,680
When people have access to
a robust web experience,

236
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,850
they're actually more likely
to download the Spotify app.

237
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,500
So to summarize, we had a hunch
that the app download barrier

238
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,840
was turning users
away from Spotify

239
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,970
and hurting our
growth potential.

240
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,070
By building a web
experience, we made

241
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,820
Spotify accessible to more users
and have seen sustained growth

242
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,180
on both the web and
in our native apps.

243
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,970
If you are on the fence
about investing in web,

244
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,790
I would start by understanding
what barriers are keeping you

245
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,430
from reaching your customers.

246
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,110
After you've done
that, then start

247
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,530
understanding how the web
can remove those barriers.

248
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,600
And finally, start
with small tests

249
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,150
to validate your hypothesis
that the web can unlock growth.

250
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,090
Just like Spotify,
you might find

251
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:54,630
that the web is a powerful
way to reach your goals.

252
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,460
Now, I'm going to
turn it over to David

253
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,400
to talk about how Starbucks
meets their customers where

254
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,240
they are--

255
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,157
on the web.

256
00:11:02,157 --> 00:11:04,113
[APPLAUSE]

257
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:05,091
Good luck, man.

258
00:11:05,091 --> 00:11:06,174
DAVID BRUNELLE: Thank you.

259
00:11:06,174 --> 00:11:08,025
[MUSIC PLAYING]

260
00:11:08,025 --> 00:11:10,470


261
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,800
Good morning.

262
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,050
My name is David Bernelle.

263
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,300
And my team builds
the digital product

264
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,730
used by Starbucks
customers in the US

265
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,680
in a number of
international markets.

266
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,380
And our job is to extend
the Starbucks experience

267
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,290
beyond the four walls of
our stores to the devices

268
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,080
that our customers
have in their hands.

269
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,940
In early 2017, we
asked ourselves,

270
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,570
how can we use the web to
give our customers the best

271
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,460
experience possible?

272
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,320
That question led us to
launch a PWA later that year.

273
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,910
And I'm excited to share some
more of that story with you--

274
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:46,890
the why, the how, and some
of what we've learned so far.

275
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,480
Before we started,
we knew a few things.

276
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,370
First, millions of customers
were using our native apps

277
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:56,010
every day to order ahead
and pay in our stores.

278
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,170
Second, the
Starbucks native apps

279
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,650
had a higher number of daily
active users than our website.

280
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,410
But third, the
Starbucks website had

281
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,080
significantly more
monthly active users

282
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,880
than our native apps.

283
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,950
In fact, our website
was reaching 6 million

284
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:15,000
more people every
month than our IOS app.

285
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,190
The opportunity for us was huge.

286
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,200
If we could provide
a better experience

287
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,080
to these 6 million
users, we believed

288
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,520
they'd have a more meaningful
interaction with Starbucks

289
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,827
and that that would be
great for our business.

290
00:12:26,827 --> 00:12:28,410
It was important for
us to build a web

291
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,410
app that was as full-featured
and pleasant to use

292
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,820
as our native apps.

293
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:38,220
That meant that it had to be
reliable, fast, and engaging.

294
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,830
Our customers tend to
use higher-end devices,

295
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:44,460
but they experience a wide
variety of network conditions.

296
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,140
We have stores all over--

297
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,450
suburban shopping
centers, basements,

298
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:52,371
and office buildings, and
airports, for some examples.

299
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,120
Customers at these
stores might experience

300
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,740
3G, unpredictable Wi-Fi
like captive Wi-Fi portals,

301
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,690
or have no connection at all.

302
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,660
When a customer walks into
any of these locations,

303
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,430
they need to be able
to open their app,

304
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:09,900
scan their barcode to pay,
and be on their way quickly.

305
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,150
We addressed this by using
some of the web platform's

306
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,620
capabilities--

307
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,610
JavaScript, HTML, CSS,
and other static assets

308
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:18,960
are cached locally.

309
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,956
Don't pay too much attention to
the code you see up on screen.

310
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:24,330
It's there to illustrate just
how little code is actually

311
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:27,840
required to implement runtime
caching and precaching

312
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,850
thanks to Workbox.

313
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,300
User-specific data is then
encrypted and stored locally

314
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,010
with IndexedDB.

315
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,800
This means that, when a
customer opens up the PWA,

316
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,380
she can expect it to work.

317
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,020
Customers need our
PWA to be fast.

318
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,810
No one wants to be standing in
front of the barista waiting

319
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,630
for their app to load
while a line develops

320
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,430
behind them,
especially if you're

321
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,700
a millennial like Aanchal.

322
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,790
Some strategies that helped
us make the PWA fast--

323
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,970
webpack helps us keep our
JavaScript bundle small.

324
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,480
This means that devices only
need to download and parse

325
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,760
the code needed to
power the experience

326
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,820
they're trying to access.

327
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,430
We use the Service Worker
API and Workbox precache

328
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,010
to download additional
JavaScript in CSS

329
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:17,080
before the user needs it.

330
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,530
Our CDN dynamically
optimizes images,

331
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:25,190
serving the right size and the
right format at the right time.

332
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:29,140
These and other techniques mean
that our PWA's initial time

333
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:33,220
to interactive is two times
faster than the web experiences

334
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,360
it replaced.

335
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,230
And subsequent page
loads are lightning fast.

336
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,500
Starbucks customers trust us to
keep their personal information

337
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,990
and payment data
safe and secure.

338
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,710
The Credential Management
API gives us the ability

339
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,420
to provide customers
the opportunity

340
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,057
to sign in using
saved credentials,

341
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,890
eliminating a lot of
the friction associated

342
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,470
with signing it.

343
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,390
Today, 28% of
customers using Chrome

344
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,300
across mobile and desktop use
the Credential Management API

345
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,030
to authenticate.

346
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,310
Using Add to Home
screen, customers

347
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:09,940
can quickly install the
Starbucks PWA to their phone.

348
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,130
Once on their home screen,
it's indistinguishable

349
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,587
from native apps.

350
00:15:13,587 --> 00:15:15,670
And paying for your order
by scanning your barcode

351
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,870
is only two taps away.

352
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,720
And it's really a joy to use.

353
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,720
Throughout the experience, we've
added thoughtful animations

354
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,790
and meaningful user feedback.

355
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:29,240
The experience is compliant
with web content accessibility

356
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,860
guidelines.

357
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,140
We use a pattern library
to ensure consistency

358
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:38,342
throughout the PWA and other
web experiences at Starbucks.

359
00:15:38,342 --> 00:15:39,800
The pattern library
is a collection

360
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,470
of React UI components,
shared styles,

361
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,570
and commonly used utilities.

362
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,860
Developers consume the
pattern library via NPM.

363
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,580
And we also expose
it as a web app

364
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,190
so developers can
access documentation

365
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,310
and so that folks from our
design and product teams

366
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,440
can access components
and interact with them

367
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,280
to see exactly how they'll
behave in a browser.

368
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,230
The great thing
about building a PWA

369
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,690
is that it runs in a
wide variety of devices

370
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,510
that might not be supported
by our native apps

371
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,210
like this commenter
from Hacker News who

372
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,640
was excited to discover that
they had a Starbucks app that

373
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,610
worked on their BlackBerry.

374
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,550
We built our PWA
to be mobile first.

375
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,500
But because we built
it to be responsive,

376
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,410
it provides a great
experience on desktop too.

377
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,780
And we've discovered that
customers love to order coffee

378
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,010
from the desktop.

379
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:32,790
In fact, 25% of our orders
through the Starbucks PWA

380
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,915
come from desktop browsers.

381
00:16:33,915 --> 00:16:36,510


382
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,270
In short, we've learned that
customers love the Starbucks

383
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:43,200
PWA, and it's been
great for business.

384
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,050
Since we launched
app.starbucks.com and created

385
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,020
an experience that's on par
with that of our native apps,

386
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,290
the number of customers joining
Starbucks rewards via the web

387
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:55,270
has increased by 65%.

388
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,490
So should you invest in the web?

389
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,280
Yeah, absolutely.

390
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,620
The web's reach is
massive, and the barriers

391
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,280
to create a high-performing
PWA are quite low.

392
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,140
You've heard it from
Rizzo at Spotify,

393
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,700
now from me at Starbucks,
that the results are real.

394
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,829
Now I'd like to introduce
you to Zack from Pinterest

395
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:17,490
to tell you about how their
team keeps their PWA fast.

396
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,850
[APPLAUSE]

397
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:26,140


398
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,504
ZACK ARGYLE: Hi.

399
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,420
My name's Zach Argyle.

400
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,360
And I lead the web
platform team at Pinterest.

401
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,330
About a year ago, we teamed
up with the growth team

402
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:39,790
to rebuild Pinterest mobile
web from scratch, but why?

403
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:45,555
Well, for one, our users did
not like the current offering.

404
00:17:45,555 --> 00:17:48,410
[LAUGHTER]

405
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,950
It hurts because it's so real.

406
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,810


407
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,910
So Stephanie, if
you're watching,

408
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,760
my sincerest apologies.

409
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,630
At the time, our mobile website
was essentially just an upsell

410
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,620
for our native app.

411
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,480
However, we noticed
that the number

412
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,580
of users who actually
downloaded the app compared

413
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,550
to the number that actually
came to the mobile website

414
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,730
was very low.

415
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,700
And we knew we could do better.

416
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,280
So last year, we shipped
a from-scratch rewrite

417
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,740
of the mobile website in
just under three months.

418
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,460


419
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,090
It was four times faster to
load for initial page loads

420
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,934
and almost six times faster
on subsequent visits.

421
00:18:26,934 --> 00:18:28,350
The initial
JavaScript bundle size

422
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:32,880
decreased from 650
kilobytes to less than 200.

423
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,620
And our CSS payload
decreased from 160 kilobytes

424
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,880
to 6 inlined into the app shell.

425
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,150
But what about now?

426
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:43,650
It's done.

427
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,150
We shipped.

428
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,210
It's over.

429
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,620
We can all go home.

430
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,010
We did our job.

431
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:51,080
Unfortunately,
entropy is very real.

432
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,070
At Pinterest, we have
over 100 engineers

433
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,662
committing to the web code base.

434
00:18:55,662 --> 00:18:57,370
So we had to ask
ourselves, what could we

435
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,460
do to make sure that this
fast experience stayed fast

436
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,350
as time went by?

437
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,950
The answer was
performance budgets.

438
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,970


439
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,870
At Pinterest, this breaks
down into three sections--

440
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,154
logging, alerting,
and prevention.

441
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:15,820
There's two main
metrics that we look at

442
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,790
to ensure that the
PWA stays fast.

443
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,630
And the first is
JavaScript bundle size.

444
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,570


445
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:25,000
For logging, we wrote
a webpack plugin

446
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,820
that reports development
and production bundle sizes

447
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,205
to our internal logging system.

448
00:19:29,205 --> 00:19:31,510
This gave us the ability to
track bundle size changes

449
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:36,260
over time for all of
our web applications.

450
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,410
And then, using those
real-time metrics,

451
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,000
we built out dashboards
with alerting

452
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,950
enabled to make sure that all
of our core bundles stay small.

453
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,810
We know painfully,
from experience,

454
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,840
that one of the main
offenders of JavaScript bloat

455
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,350
is importing something with
a large dependency tree.

456
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:57,280
A single line of code could add
tens or hundreds of kilobytes

457
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,280
to your bundle.

458
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,250
So to help prevent this from
happening in our monorepo,

459
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,220
we wrote an ESLint Plugin
to disallow imports

460
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,700
from certain paths.

461
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,930
For example, our mobile web-only
code base cannot import from

462
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,160
our desktop-only code base.

463
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,430


464
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,680
The other metric we care about
is a composite performance

465
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,280
metric called Pinner
Wait Time, or PWT.

466
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,410
It's a combination of
time-to-interactive and image

467
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,120
load times.

468
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,841
When deciding what
to measure, look

469
00:20:26,841 --> 00:20:28,090
to what your users care about.

470
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:31,540
For us, that's images.

471
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,330
Until the above-the-fold images
are loaded, to our users,

472
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,569
page load is not complete.

473
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:37,360
So that time-to-interactive
was not enough.

474
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,130
So we created a
custom metric specific

475
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,380
to our service and
user expectations.

476
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,599
We also tracked more
granular performance metrics,

477
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:45,640
like time-to-first-paint
and time-to-interactive,

478
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,310
which are really helpful
for debugging performance

479
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,080
regressions.

480
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,350
We also have client-side logging
that includes browser, country,

481
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,180
user state, and
many other fields

482
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,792
that are helpful for
segmenting usage.

483
00:20:57,792 --> 00:20:59,500
Again, we set up
dashboards with alerting

484
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,999
enabled to make sure that all
these [INAUDIBLE] pages stayed

485
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:03,370
fast.

486
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,040
We did notice that one of the
main offenders of page load

487
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,980
regression was the
hundreds of experiments

488
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,820
that we had running
at any given time.

489
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,120
So we added performance
regression information, front

490
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,380
and center in our
experiment dashboard,

491
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,490
so the engineers could be
aware of any performance impact

492
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,890
caused by their experiments.

493
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:24,170
This also means that you
can see the performance

494
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:28,980
improvements of your experiment
as well, which was really cool.

495
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,580
These are just a few examples
of how we incorporated logging,

496
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,731
alerting, and prevention
into our workflows

497
00:21:33,731 --> 00:21:35,730
to ensure that progressive
web apps stayed fast.

498
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,690
And we saw incredible
results from building out

499
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,890
the experience.

500
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,050
Year over year on
the mobile web,

501
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:49,200
we saw a 103% increase in
weekly users, nearly 300%

502
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,030
increase in session length,
and our mobile website

503
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,940
has since been our
number one platform

504
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:01,030
for new user sign-ups surpassing
Android, IOS, and desktop web.

505
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,950
You've seen it from
David and Rizzo.

506
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,170
The future is truly
in the browser.

507
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,422
And performance is the
foundation of it all.

508
00:22:07,422 --> 00:22:09,130
With these budgeting
strategies in place,

509
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:11,296
we've continued to see
incredible growth, especially

510
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:13,330
in emerging markets where
bandwidth is limited

511
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,640
and low-end devices are common.

512
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,790
In some countries, a year after
shipping our new experience,

513
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:22,570
weekly users had
increased by over 300%.

514
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:27,810
And the number of pins seen
had increased by over 600%.

515
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,850
For Pinterest, the
number of pins seen

516
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,550
is directly correlated
with our overall revenue.

517
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:35,720


518
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,910
Investing in improving and
maintaining performance

519
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:41,070
has directly impacted the
company's bottom line.

520
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:45,260
So if you, like Pinterest,
care about an exceptional user

521
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:49,670
experience, regardless of
device, network, or conditions,

522
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:53,160
build a progressive web app
with performance as a priority.

523
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,940
If you'd like to read more about
our one-year PWA retrospective,

00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,980
use the short link
on the slide to visit

525
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,810
"Pinterest Engineering" blog.

526
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,970
And with that, I'm happy
to bring Aanchal back

527
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,602
on stage to share a
quick recap for you all.

528
00:23:04,602 --> 00:23:07,906
[APPLAUSE]

529
00:23:07,906 --> 00:23:12,160


530
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,380
AANCHAL BAHADUR: All
right, so it's day one.

531
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,431
It's just the first start
of Chrome Dev Summit.

532
00:23:16,431 --> 00:23:19,055
Can you please join me in giving
a thunderous round of applause

533
00:23:19,055 --> 00:23:22,799
to David, Zack, and Rizzo
for summing up months

534
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:23,840
and months of hard work--

535
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,580
[APPLAUSE]

536
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,860
into just five minutes?

537
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,460


538
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,060
All right.

539
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,590
So if you remember what
I said at the beginning,

540
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:35,650
you also know I have a
very short attention span.

541
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,180
So I was backstage making notes.

542
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,001
I have three things
to share with you.

543
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,375
This is the part
of the job where

544
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,210
you remember to
keep your phones out

545
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,130
to take photographs and
screenshots if you're

546
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,540
watching us on video.

547
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,900
Very quickly-- three business
wins from Pinterest, Starbucks,

548
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,540
and Spotify.

549
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,000
So if, like Spotify, you
want to get more users,

550
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,380
remove friction.

551
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,800
It seems pretty obvious,
but the results are real.

552
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,000
Run multiple tests.

553
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,770
Be convinced, just
like they were.

554
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:05,280
Rizzo told me it took eight or
nine tests for them to do this.

555
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,070
And the results-- an
increase in activation,

556
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:15,580
54%, and retention, 14%
increase in day-60 active users.

557
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,010
If, like Starbucks you
want to meet your users

558
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,120
where they are--

559
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,570
airports, hostel rooms,
tanking up on caffeine,

560
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:26,840
wherever they might be, be sure
to be using Workbox caching

561
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,040
strategies.

562
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,440
And my favorite thing about
their progressive web app

563
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,910
is the thoughtful
animations that

564
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:35,510
pop up to make sure that my
100 different customizations

565
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,670
of my coffee are
actually accurate.

566
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,170
It's fantastic.

567
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:42,380
65% increase in number of
customers joining the Starbucks

568
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,120
Rewards program--

569
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,230
direct business impact.

570
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,950
And finally, if you want to set
a standard for web performance,

571
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,450
be like Pinterest.

572
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:56,310
Focus on performance, focus on
setting a performance budget--

573
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:59,140
600% increase in
number of pins seen.

574
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,230
When Zack told me this number,
I was, like, are you sure?

575
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,760
600%?

576
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,140
But it's real.

577
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:09,540
This has positively impacted
Pinterest's overall revenue.

578
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,720
So now you're wondering.

579
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,890
This is all great.

580
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,990
How am I going to get there?

581
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,440
We've given you the tools.

582
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,190
We are here to support you.

583
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,940
And this talk is going
to be up on YouTube

584
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,500
right after I say thank you.

585
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,710
So please go and build
top-notch web experiences.

586
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,370
Do it.

587
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,570
Do it for the millennials.

588
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,410
Thank you.

589
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:29,760
