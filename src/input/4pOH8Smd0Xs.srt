00:00:04.885 --> 00:00:06.760
MARTIN SPLITT: Good to
be back on this stage.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.250
And I hope that you all
have some energy left

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.860
from two fantastic days
of lots of content.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.970
And content is what we're mostly
going to be talking about as

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.180
well, because I would like to
talk to you about what we have

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.990
done to bring your content
out more in Google Search

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.000
and make it shine.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.690
Cool!

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:26.230
All right.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.400
So I think one of
the things that I

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.300
have learned over the last one
and a half years-ish of talking

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.790
with you all and also bringing
my perspective as a web

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.980
developer to the
Google Search team

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.950
is that sometimes
we underestimate

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.950
the power of Google Search and
what it does to our website.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.220
Because, fundamentally,
why do we build websites?

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.133
I mean, sure, OK, we
also build websites

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.050
because we are kind of
excited about the stuff

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.720
that we can build, like any new
capabilities and all that stuff

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.220
that we brought to
the web platform.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.900
They're exciting.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.840
But, fundamentally, we build
our websites for users.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.989
And all our work towards
performance, and user

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.590
experience, and safety,
and privacy, and all that

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.340
are basically
mirroring that as well.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.630
But, fundamentally, we want
users to find our content

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.130
because the web
apps that we create,

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.690
the content that
we put on the web,

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.940
we think is very, very valuable.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.890
Hopefully you think that
your content is valuable.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.670
If not, we should have
a chat, I believe.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.070
But, OK, let's assume that
you think that your content is

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.650
really good, and you have
done the necessary steps

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.090
to make it good.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.740
How much does Google
Search give you?

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.940
How much does it help you?

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.190
Well, it turns out,
by a recent study

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.200
that was done, that
approximately 53%

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.220
of the traffic that
websites are seeing

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.042
are actually coming
through organic search.

00:01:48.042 --> 00:01:49.000
What is organic search?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.610
That's your day-to-day
search engine

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.413
of choice, whatever it is.

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:55.080
That can be Google
Search, for instance.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.190
So what we are doing
is we are trying

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.690
to bring free traffic to you, to
bring your content to the users

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.630
to make sure that your content
can actually shine and prosper

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.000
on the web and that you,
your company, your business

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.740
can actually be
successful as well.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.100
So that's one way
to look at Search.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.160
And I think, for us developers,
it's an important venue

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.765
to understand where are the
users coming from who we hope

00:02:18.765 --> 00:02:20.140
to be on the site,
and how can we

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.307
make sure that they are
seeing the content that they

00:02:22.307 --> 00:02:24.890
need to see, because it's
our content after all.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.800
And today, I'd like
to look back at what

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.320
we have done this year to make
Google Search better for you.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.070
So we are making things
better without you

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.987
having to do the work.

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:34.800
Isn't that amazing?

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.580
It's like free, good stuff.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.168
It's like a free cookie.

00:02:38.168 --> 00:02:38.710
I don't know.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.200
It's not as good as
a cookie, though.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.660
I still think, though,
cookies, the entire thing

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.730
with baking cookies
is a weird one anyway.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.745
I think you have
good cookie dough,

00:02:47.745 --> 00:02:50.120
and then you put it in the
oven and it comes out as good?

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.580
But no, anyway.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.690
Might just be me.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.620
So one of the biggest things
that has happened in this year

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.020
is probably our
announcement at Google I/O

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.280
that Googlebot is now evergreen.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.780
Right?

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.920
That's a quantum leap.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.640
We have been using a crawler
or a rendering engine that

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.370
was a little behind, and
we have jumped forward

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.400
to making that evergreen, to
keep up with Google Chrome

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.800
and actually give you all the
features that Google brings

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.160
to the web platform, also in
rendering so that we can index

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.770
the content that relies
on these new technologies,

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.200
and possibilities, and
capabilities of the web

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.080
platform.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.880
But what does that really mean?

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.910
Well, first things first.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.670
This is a huge leap, and
has been basically worked

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.770
on by many teams, many people.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.440
A lot of the work is now
also visible in other venues.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.870
Puppeteer, for instance,
is a side effect

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.240
from what we have done
in Google Search as well.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.910
And it brings over a
thousand new features.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.870
ES6, we have proper Web
Component version 1 support.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.880
We have-- well,
no we don't have--

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.740
we have a bunch of new stuff
that we didn't have before.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.420
You can now rely on that to
not be an SEO problem, to not

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.190
get in the way of
your content actually

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.840
being accessible
to Google Search

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.030
and actually being
visible in Google Search.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.730
We have also made sure
that we are not just

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.230
doing one update one time.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.800
But within a relatively
short timeframe

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.920
of every new stable release
that comes to Chrome,

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.650
we are actually updating our
Googlebot rendering engine

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.440
as well, so that what
you see in your Chrome

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.220
is also what you see
in Google Search.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.333
And not just that.

00:04:21.333 --> 00:04:22.750
We also made sure
that the testing

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.950
tools we have out there--

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.900
the rich results
test, the M-test,

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.750
the mobile-friendly test, the
URL inspection tool within

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.680
Search Console--

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.950
all these tools, they are
also up-to-date with whatever

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.540
version of Chrome
we are using when

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.280
Googlebot renders your pages.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.650
So you can actually
verify that things

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.495
are working in Google Search.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.470
The nice thing is that,
with this new change,

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.690
we are all still catching up to
what this means when Microsoft

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.330
announced that Edge is
now using Chromium as well

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.900
as the rendering engine.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.860
We were really, really excited
to see that Bing has also went

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.630
forward and went like, OK, yes.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.110
We are also running with
an evergreen Bingbot,

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.560
and we want to render JavaScript
using state-of-the-art

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.860
rendering as well.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.090
So this means that now, across
the industry in search engines,

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.950
we are seeing signals
of actually getting up

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.430
to speed with the modern web
in search engine indexing,

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.500
and that's really,
really exciting to me.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.410
Also, basically, Google
Search got a lot more powerful

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.260
because we are using the
browser that you are probably

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.780
using as well when we
are rendering your pages,

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.090
and making sure that
we work and continue

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.060
to work on making sure that
what we see when we index

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.310
your content to show
it to users on Search

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.070
later, that we are seeing
what you're seeing as well.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.300
Right?

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.950
But there is one thing where
we still have some work to do.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.660
This is the user
agent that you see

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.990
in your server logs
if we are accessing

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.930
your content with Googlebot.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.250
And the keen eye might spot
that something's off here.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.240
Right?

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.040
And I get asked this
question, but you said

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.460
it's an evergreen Googlebot.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.420
But then I look at my
server logs and I see this.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.620
What's happening here?

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.870
The simple answer
to that is that we

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.700
are working to maximize the
compatibility between Google

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.190
Search and websites,
and we can't just

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.450
make changes like this.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.550
We have to test
things very carefully.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.000
And we make sure that we are
supporting everyone's content

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.080
in Google Search.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.630
So we had to basically
be very, very careful

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.910
moving forward with
the user agent.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.070
But we have announced
multiple times now

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.640
that this is about to change.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:39.490
We are about to update the
user agent in Google rendering.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:40.950
So please, please,
please, if you

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.290
are having some
sort of code that

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.050
is doing UA sniffing
for Googlebot,

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.380
do not match to the exact
string that you saw earlier.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.590
Match, basically, very
roughly about Googlebot.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.110
If you want to know if it's
a real Googlebot or not,

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.390
that is perfectly possible.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.080
We have documentation on that.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.250
You can do a reverse
DNS lookup from the IP

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.750
that we tell you
we are coming from.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.020
If that resolves towards
Google IP addresses,

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.655
then you know it's
an actual Googlebot.

00:07:05.655 --> 00:07:07.530
Because the user agent
string does not really

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.010
give you that benefit.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.660
So please make sure that, if you
have workarounds for Googlebot

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.110
and others, that you are not
too strictly matching the user

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.940
agent in the future
going forward,

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.040
because this change is
hopefully happening in December.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.620
That's what we are aiming for.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.037
If you want to
learn more, you can

00:07:24.037 --> 00:07:26.490
go to webmasters.googleblog.com
and learn

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.810
more about this change as well.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:29.640
Cool.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.310
Another thing that I
oftentimes get asked--

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.290
and it's a very,
very fair question--

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.650
is what about JavaScript being
so much slower in indexing

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:41.160
and rendering in Google Search
than non-JavaScript websites.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.630
Is that still a problem?

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:47.530
Well, last year, Tom
and I were on this stage

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.720
and telling you well, you
know, it can take up to a week.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.510
We are very sorry for this.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:54.760
Forget this, OK?

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.860
Because the new numbers
look a lot better.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.410
So we actually went
over the numbers

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:04.330
and found that it turns out that
at median, the time we spend

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.380
between crawling and actually
having the rendered results,

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.494
on-median, it's five seconds.

00:08:11.494 --> 00:08:14.430
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.230
Right?

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.420
A few keen eyes here
might be like, oh,

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.838
but what's the 90th percentile?

00:08:20.838 --> 00:08:22.630
To which I can say,
don't worry about that.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.130
That's within minutes.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:26.850
So you don't have to worry about
week-long delays or something,

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:27.880
or anything like that.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.290
However, be prepared that
you might still hear that.

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:33.270
And the reason for
that is the way

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.580
that the entire
pipeline really works.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.950
So the pipeline that
Googlebot runs through

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.510
is actually quite
a complicated one.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.934
This is a gross
oversimplification.

00:08:41.934 --> 00:08:43.559
It's much, much more
complex than that.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:45.780
A bunch of stuff might
happen at the same time.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.980
A few steps might
run multiple times.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.410
It is more
complicated than this.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.260
However, most of it
is transparent to you

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.672
because it's an
implementation detail

00:08:54.672 --> 00:08:56.130
that you shouldn't
be worried about

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.755
and you don't have
to be worried about.

00:08:57.755 --> 00:09:00.990
But effectively, that means
that the only moments when

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.540
you actually see if
something's happening

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.990
are actually when we cross.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.400
When we make an HTTP
request to your service,

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.200
we leave a mark in
your server logs.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.602
You see, a-ha, Googlebot
is fetching this request.

00:09:14.602 --> 00:09:16.560
But you don't really see
when we are processing

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.570
because there's not much
actionable things that

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:19.445
happen in processing.

00:09:19.445 --> 00:09:22.170
It's just like us
dealing with the response

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:23.700
and with the robots.txt.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.000
And all that kind of stuff
happens and in crawling

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.320
and in processing.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.670
You don't really see that.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.140
Rendering itself,
you don't really

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.320
see that because we are just
working through the resources,

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.720
executing your JavaScript,
producing content, bringing

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.440
that back to processing.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.230
There's not much you can see.

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.300
What you can see, though,
is at the very end

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.360
of this entire process, you
see when the content shows up

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.890
in search results.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:47.460
Right?

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.710
So there is a whole lot
of stuff happening in

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:52.230
between these two points
that you can actually

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.480
measure and see.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.700
There's canonicalization, which
means removing duplicates.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:58.810
There's error handling.

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.590
What happens if there's
a network timeout?

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:02.710
What happens if your server
was down for a moment?

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.490
These kind of things
we handle for you.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.380
You don't have to
worry about them.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.900
But that means
that if we are only

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.550
coming around crawling
every now and then,

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.520
and then certain things
happen on our side

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.140
that you don't have
to worry about,

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.000
it might take a while
until you actually

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.080
see things in the index.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.930
But that doesn't mean that
JavaScript held them back.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:22.630
Generally speaking, as we saw,
we are really, really fast

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.180
in rendering, so that's
not really an issue

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:29.000
that you need to be
worried about anymore.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.500
OK.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.100
So now, I have basically
addressed the two biggest

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.650
questions that I kept getting
since I/O, when we announced

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:36.970
the evergreen Googlebot.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.770
The user update is
going to change,

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.470
and rendering delays are
not really a big problem

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:42.820
that you have to deal with.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:47.350
You can be pretty relaxed about
using JavaScript in your pages

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:49.400
for SEO reasons.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.540
But now let's take
a step back and see

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:55.000
what is actually the complexity
of this entire thing.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.400
Why did it take
so long and what's

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.950
involved in making a renderer?

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.660
Or how do I make a
rendering engine?

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.310
How hard can this be?

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:06.550
Just give me 10 minutes and
I'll have a renderer, right?

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:08.930
So what if we take
Puppeteer, for instance,

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.860
which is effectively a
programmatically-controlled

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.070
Chromium instance, which
is what our rendering is

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:15.250
as well, right?

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.170
And we just build our
own rendering engine.

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:17.860
OK, cool.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.450
Well, renderer for
search purposes.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.870
So I think the easiest
thing when we use Puppeteer

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:23.950
is to just get started.

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:27.280
You just open a new page
in your Puppeteer instance,

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.870
and you set the viewport.

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:33.140
Except what do you
set your viewport to?

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.530
Mobile dimensions.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.080
OK, but what are
mobile dimensions?

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.560
And what if the
content is very long?

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.280
Hmm.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.640
This is already a little weird.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.140
OK.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.000
Let's just assume we somehow
figured that one out.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.810
We set our viewport dimensions--
easygoing, whatever.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:51.140
Next step is we just have
to fetch the actual page.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.430
So we make a network request.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.582
We get all the HTML in,
that loads all the images

00:11:55.582 --> 00:11:56.540
and all the JavaScript.

00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:00.110
So we have to load
these resources as well.

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:03.130
And we wait until
the page is done.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.320
But what does "done" mean?

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.240
Do we wait until the
DOM content loaded?

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.220
Do we wait for page load?

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.880
Do we wait for when the CPU
doesn't do anything anymore?

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.210
But what if the CPU keeps
cycling through JavaScript

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:18.757
because there's some sort of
periodic thing that happens?

00:12:18.757 --> 00:12:19.840
What if it takes too long?

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.910
What if there's an infinite
loop in your website?

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:23.830
Does that mean that
this instance is now

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:26.770
completely blocked forever?

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.330
Do we wait five seconds?

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.910
10 seconds?

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:33.240
This is what Rendertron does.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.990
Rendertron just goes
like, until we do not

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:36.490
have anything on
the network anymore

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.740
or a certain threshold
is over, then

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.800
we're just going to kill this.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.130
But this is a simplification.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:43.547
We are having a
lot of work to do

00:12:43.547 --> 00:12:45.880
to make sure that we actually
wait until your website is

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.370
ready and do not fall
in the trap of waiting

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:49.780
too long either.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:50.320
Right?

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.620
So that's a problem.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.500
And last but not least,
now we have actually

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.930
gotten this website to render.

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:56.960
What do we do next?

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.830
Well, we need to figure out
what is the content here.

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:05.680
So can we just pull the HTML
from the entire document

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.830
like this?

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.170
But what about Shadow DOM?

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:10.270
Hm.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:11.190
That's a tricky one.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:12.940
How do I deal with
Shadow DOM being there?

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.800
Because I might not get
Shadow DOM through this,

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.383
because the Shadow DOM border
is going to hide that Shadow DOM

00:13:17.383 --> 00:13:18.257
content.

00:13:18.257 --> 00:13:19.540
Ah.

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.360
This is tricky.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:25.030
You see, the point here is that
it isn't as straightforward

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:28.380
as you think to actually
build a renderer.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.350
Our teams have worked years
to make this as perfect

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:32.140
as possible.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.110
And we are continuously
working on improving.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.240
And we're continuously
testing and monitoring

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.060
what happens in Search to
make sure that your website is

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.900
rendered properly.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.420
There are things you can
do to help us out here.

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:44.535
Make your websites fast.

00:13:44.535 --> 00:13:46.680
Make your websites reliable.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.130
Make sure that they're not
taking too much CPU resources.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.190
They are not
killing the network.

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:56.080
Because these are effects
that users will also feel.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.720
So we are working to make
these complexities go away,

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.820
but you should not worry
about these complexities.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.020
This is the nice thing about it.

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.390
It's an API that is relatively
easy and straightforward

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:05.320
to deal with.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.120
You just make good
websites for the user.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.337
The rest is my problem.

00:14:09.337 --> 00:14:10.170
It's nice, isn't it?

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:11.462
It's like, it's not my problem.

00:14:11.462 --> 00:14:13.240
It's Martin's.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.228
How can I ever sleep again?

00:14:15.228 --> 00:14:15.770
I don't know.

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:17.350
We'll see.

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:18.700
This has been quite a journey.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.430
I mean, this sounds
quite not large and big,

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:26.260
but the evergreen Googlebot
turned search results indexing

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.380
from websites that
showed up when Googlebot

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.450
was accessing them
like this, into getting

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:33.470
the proper content.

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:35.590
So we are finally
ready to use whatever

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:37.390
you are throwing at
us, as long as it

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:40.837
is reasonable for the
users and the web in total.

00:14:40.837 --> 00:14:42.670
And I think this is a
very important moment.

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.280
So these are complexities that
we are taking away from you,

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.810
and you can focus on building
better things for the user.

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:50.080
And I think that's the key here.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.660
And we are pretty happy that
this is not just us being like,

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:54.530
well done!

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.110
No, it's actually being
seen in the industry,

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:58.530
especially also from SEOs.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:04.470
So Bartosz-- from Onely, which
is a technical SEO agency--

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:08.130
published a case study and an
article of the JavaScript SEO

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.240
state in 2019.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.270
And he compared that
to 2018 and said

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:16.810
this is an amazing improvement,
and we have been doing so much

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:17.840
better in these terms.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.190
And I like this
specific quote where

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.570
he said, "If you look
at National Geographic,

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:24.230
they're a very good example.

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:28.720
100% of their JavaScript
content is indexed quickly."

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.340
So that makes us
very, very happy.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:33.550
And this should be your signal
to bring this information back

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:37.270
to your SEO experts and SEO
advisors, and tell them, look,

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.850
JavaScript is an
important part of the web.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:43.450
And modern web applications can
be successful in Google Search.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:46.880
That is absolutely possible.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.200
Now I would like to quickly
walk through a few things

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.110
and a few patterns that I'd
like to quickly discuss,

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:54.230
because I think they are
great patterns to use.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:55.760
And they are also
very, very helpful

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.570
for indexing in Google Search
or rendering in Google Search.

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:00.590
One is lazy loading.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:02.810
I think we're all very
happy that we finally

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:06.760
have the native lazy loading
APIs for images and iframes.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.720
These work in Googlebot.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.310
As Googlebot is
evergreen, we are

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:12.030
supporting these attributes.

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.460
And they are not hurting you.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.070
So if you are not
using them yet,

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:16.820
you should definitely
consider using them.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.490
It's such a low-hanging
fruit to do.

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.920
If you need more complex
lazy loading, or lazy loading

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.650
on elements or
content that does not

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:27.140
fall into the two categories
where native lazy loading

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.240
exists, I highly
recommend checking out

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.528
the Intersection Observer.

00:16:30.528 --> 00:16:31.820
Because who would have thought?

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.710
This is also now
supported in Googlebot.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.750
And we are testing this
quite frequently as well.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:41.190
So this allows you to
have more custom lazy

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:43.100
loading if you need to.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.260
As I said, Web
Components are supported.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.960
But as I also said, when
I said let's build a naive

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.748
renderer using
Puppeteer, Shadow Dom

00:16:50.748 --> 00:16:52.040
is an interesting thing, right?

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:56.350
So I got questions
about how does that--

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:57.020
huh?

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:57.770
Is it supported?

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:58.470
Does it work?

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:01.160
Can we actually index
content inside Shadow DOMs?

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.900
And the answer is yes!

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.069
Yes, we do.

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:06.678
This is absolutely,
perfectly fine.

00:17:06.678 --> 00:17:07.970
We have the Shadow DOM content.

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:09.680
In this case, is this indexed?

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.390
Yes, it is.

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:12.329
What about this?

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:13.992
And then we use some
mechanism to get

00:17:13.992 --> 00:17:15.200
whatever is in the Light DOM.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.760
In this case, can you render me?

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.680
We pull this into
the Shadow DOM,

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.770
and that gets flattened
into the tree.

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:22.270
And then we can
index both of these.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:25.250
So all of the content here
will be successfully indexed

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:27.079
in Google Search.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:31.150
So that means we have finally
full, proper version 1 Web

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.376
Component support
in Google Search.

00:17:33.376 --> 00:17:36.232
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.650
I cried a little when
we had that moment.

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:42.910
I'm like, finally!

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:45.160
Such a beautiful moment.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.140
Another thing that I'd
like to just bring up--

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.640
because that's something that
doesn't just like magically we

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.920
fix it, because we
think it's not broken--

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.470
is if you have images.

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:56.680
Images are a fantastic way of
engaging with your audience

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.260
and making sure that you
surface your content.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.000
If you have your
original image content,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.500
you should put that
in Image Search,

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.450
because it's a fantastic
venue for people

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:08.020
to discover your articles
around these images as well.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.930
If you want us to index
your images, totally cool.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:11.860
We got you.

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:16.160
The HTML image element is
there and is perfectly fine.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.110
This is what we do.

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:20.343
We search for image
elements in your content,

00:18:20.343 --> 00:18:21.760
and then we index
them, unless you

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:26.920
can prevent us from doing so by
setting no index or something.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:30.800
That's not great.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.530
We're not going to index that.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:34.580
Don't.

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.910
OK?

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:37.540
Sweet.

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:41.170
Speaking of images, we
are also basically working

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:44.590
towards making Image Search
more useful for users.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:47.120
We have a bunch of different
venues of doing so.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.960
So we are having better query
and understanding, as well as

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.020
we are trying to be more
useful for figuring out

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.520
the context of the
image in the article.

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.610
So we are featuring
images differently.

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:00.670
And soon you will be able to use
Search Console to also tell us

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:04.210
if you want to use
structured data to give us

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:07.180
high-resolution images.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.925
These high-resolution--
oh, sorry.

00:19:08.925 --> 00:19:13.980
[COUGHS] I shouldn't have sung
that many songs yesterday.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:14.480
Anyway.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:18.900
Stage.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:19.950
Right.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:22.170
So if you want your
high-resolution images

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:24.910
to not hurt performance,
you can tell us

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:26.827
in structured data in
the future that you

00:19:26.827 --> 00:19:28.410
have a high-resolution
version, and we

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:32.160
can surface this in other places
like Google Homes or Google

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.190
Assistant, which brings
more traffic to these images

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.910
if you're lucky.

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:37.517
So we highly
recommend checking out

00:19:37.517 --> 00:19:39.600
the articles that are
coming up on the Google blog

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.580
in the near future,
and also using

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.450
Search Console to see if
there's new stuff coming.

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:47.820
Speaking of structured
data, we have more

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.040
structured data to make sure
that your content really

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:50.890
can shine.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:51.930
We have how-to markups.

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:55.620
We have QA pages and all
that kind of lovely stuff

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:57.220
if you want to check that out.

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:58.800
I highly recommend
using that link

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.013
to find what kind of
verticals we support.

00:20:01.013 --> 00:20:02.430
We support all
sorts of verticals.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:04.450
We support events, like
this, for instance.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:06.175
The website has
structured data so

00:20:06.175 --> 00:20:07.800
that we can highlight
that in Assistant

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.920
as well as in the Search
results, like here.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:11.800
We have recipes.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:12.900
We have articles.

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:13.900
We have books.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.800
We have movies, I
think, and TV series,

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.370
and all that kind of stuff.

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:20.430
And this gallery is
a fantastic place

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:22.740
to check out what's
happening there.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.690
And, definitely, it gets you--

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:26.820
this is very, very much
an eye catcher, right?

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.500
You get more screen
estate in Google Search,

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.530
which means your content
is more likely to catch

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:32.820
the eye of the user.

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:36.010
Recipes are one example.

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:36.840
Sweet.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.640
Last but not least, I
say we have made sure

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.500
that our tools are
always up-to-date with

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.790
the actual rendering engine.

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.730
So when you are using
mobile-friendly tests,

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:46.842
rich results tests,
all of these tests,

00:20:46.842 --> 00:20:49.050
you are actually rendering
through the real Googlebot

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:50.910
rendering process.

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:53.370
And this updates as
Googlebot updates now,

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:55.782
so we are no longer having
a discrepancy between what

00:20:55.782 --> 00:20:57.240
we do in the testing
tools and what

00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:01.170
we do in the actual Googlebot.

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:03.090
We also made sure
that we gave you

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:06.070
a better flow of working
with things in Google Search

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.570
Console.

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:08.460
The new Google
Search Console allows

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.770
you to monitor how your
entire site is doing

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.290
in terms of how is it
performing in Search,

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:15.900
but also are there pages
that are having problems,

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.480
is there structural
data that is broken,

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.000
and also all sorts
of other things.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.610
You can easily debug these
things within Google Search

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:26.010
Console and use other
tools on top of it

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:28.740
as well to make sure that
you are on top of what's

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.190
happening on your page.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.940
And you can use the Validate
Fix flow, where you can

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.490
signal to us as Google Search.

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:37.200
I think we fix
this and then we'll

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.710
double-check if that is true.

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:41.460
If it is fixed, we'll let
you know and also re-index

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.318
the page.

00:21:42.318 --> 00:21:44.610
You can validate if everything
that you have been doing

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:45.330
is right.

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:48.210
And then last but not least,
the performance report also

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.220
helps you figure out
where you can do better,

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:54.120
where can you grow
your search traffic.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.940
So besides debugging
any sort of issues

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.500
that you might
have on your site,

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.290
we have a few new,
really cool things.

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:01.920
So this is the URL
inspection tool.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.770
That has been there for a
while, but it's worthwhile

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:06.500
checking it out.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.720
It tells you how Google
Search was accessing your page

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.740
the last time.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:11.580
What was the result?

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.470
Can we index this
content or not?

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:16.170
Why can we not index it
if we can't index it?

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:17.380
What can I do about it?

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.470
And there's also the Validate
Fix flow in the screen.

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:24.870
But also, we basically give
you JavaScript debugging

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:27.000
capabilities in
Search Console, too.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.410
So you get the stack trace.

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:31.200
You get the error messages
that we are seeing when

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.580
we are rendering your website.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.130
So you no longer
have to just guess.

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:37.260
You can actually
run this and see

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.450
what we are stumbling
over, if we are stumbling

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:41.850
over some JavaScript problems.

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:45.730
A very nice one is the speed
report that launched last week.

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:50.460
So we are now having this report
that gives you an idea of,

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.530
based on the Chrome
User Experience Report

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:55.170
from real user data,
where are pages

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:56.670
that we might want to optimize.

00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:58.890
So it takes them
into three buckets.

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:00.120
It tells you these pages.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.560
This is a sample of
pages that are fast.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.290
These are pages that
are OK, moderately good.

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:06.540
And then these pages are slow.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:08.612
And you can work
with these pages

00:23:08.612 --> 00:23:10.320
and basically integrate
with other tools,

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.823
like Lighthouse or
PageSpeed Insights,

00:23:12.823 --> 00:23:15.240
to figure out where you need
to spend a little bit of time

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.260
to make them faster.

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:21.210
Imagine you have a website
with a million pages.

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:23.620
Do you want to run
Lighthouse on all of them?

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:24.510
Like, OK, cool.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.430
I'll be gone for a week.

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:27.660
I'm Lighthousing again.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.730
Lighthouse is a
fantastic tool once you

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:31.980
know where these problems are.

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:34.890
The speed report is your
way, your lens, into that.

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:37.560
You see where can
I spend some time

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.438
to make my website
significantly faster.

00:23:39.438 --> 00:23:40.730
What are the low-hanging fruit?

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:42.188
Where can I really--
where should I

00:23:42.188 --> 00:23:44.880
be drilling in and digging
in to make sure my website is

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.590
fast and great for users?

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:49.050
So we highly recommend
you check out this report,

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:52.320
as it gives you a
wonderful sitewide

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.590
overview of what's happening.

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:55.860
Cool.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.770
As you can see, it lets you
drill into the different kinds

00:23:58.770 --> 00:23:59.610
of issues.

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:01.740
And you can also,
then, see specifically

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.502
what the pages need.

00:24:03.502 --> 00:24:04.710
I see people taking pictures.

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:06.250
That's good.

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:08.610
We also have a
fantastic new document.

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:11.580
Well, it's not that new,
but it's new to many people

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:12.840
here, probably.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.170
It's the troubleshooter guide.

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:15.690
If you have JavaScript
problems, we

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:17.460
have a guide that
tries to identify

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.290
the individual problems
and then guides you

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:21.480
through potential
solutions to them.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.870
This guide is relatively new.

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:24.210
And we have worked
with the community

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:25.585
to make sure that
we are covering

00:24:25.585 --> 00:24:28.650
the most frequent
problems, but we would love

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:29.970
to hear your feedback on this.

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:33.000
If you see problems that were
not tackled in the report

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.930
or in the document,
then please let us know.

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:37.380
We are happily extending the
document with your feedback

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:38.680
as well.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.660
Sweet.

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.540
Last but not least, I'd like
you to take a few things away

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:44.678
and also to bring this
back to the SEO experts

00:24:44.678 --> 00:24:45.720
that you're working with.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:49.650
If you are an SEO expert
in the crowd here-- woo--

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:53.010
then please also bring this back
to your developers, who might

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:54.690
not be watching this stream.

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:58.110
I think one of the
things that shocked me

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:00.870
the most over the last
one and a half years

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:04.320
was that, oftentimes, SEOs
and developers are not

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.790
working hand-in-hand together.

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:07.920
Because I think we are
very powerful allies

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.210
if we work together.

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:12.653
And they can help you not deal
with all the monitoring effort

00:25:12.653 --> 00:25:14.820
and making sure that your
content strategy is right.

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:16.235
They are really good at that.

00:25:16.235 --> 00:25:18.000
But you, as developers,
you can help

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.500
them understand better what do
these performance metrics mean.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.230
What does the slow performance
mean on a specific page?

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:27.690
What does the soft
404 really do?

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:30.110
And basically help them
prioritize the things.

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:31.770
And if we work
together, we'll be

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:34.230
able to bring better
content to all our users

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:36.180
much, much more
efficiently, and we

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:39.600
will be able to unlock
these additional users that

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:43.440
might come over organic traffic
if we tick all the boxes.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.310
So we can be working together.

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:46.200
We should be allies.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.210
We should not be working
against each other.

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:49.530
OK?

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:51.780
So last but not least,
I'd like to sum it up

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:56.160
by saying Google Search is here
and will be here to help you

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.560
and your users to
find each other.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.960
We want to bring relevant
content to the users

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:05.100
that you care about, that you
might not even have met yet.

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:07.260
And with that, I'd
like to say thank

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.620
you very much for your time.

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:10.630
Enjoy the rest of the evening.

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:11.310
Bye-bye.

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:14.360
