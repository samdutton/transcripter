00:00:02,375 --> 00:00:06,295


3
00:00:06,295 --> 00:00:07,420
CHENEY TSAI: Hey, everyone.

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,250
My name is Cheney.

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,180
RAMYA RAGHAVAN: And I'm Ramya.

6
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,070
CHENEY TSAI: So we work
on a technical consulting

7
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,990
team at Google, and we
get to see companies

8
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,482
all around the world push the
boundaries of the modern web.

9
00:00:16,482 --> 00:00:17,940
RAMYA RAGHAVAN:
And while you might

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,770
have heard some
great sessions today

11
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,650
talking about different
modern web technologies,

12
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,280
we are here to focus on the
real-world challenges faced

13
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,410
by e-commerce companies
in implementing

14
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,215
these technologies.

15
00:00:29,215 --> 00:00:31,590
CHENEY TSAI: So since we're
talking about the real world,

16
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,120
a real-world metaphor.

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,540
Maintaining a website is a
lot like maintaining a house.

18
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,060
This right here is the
house that I grew up in.

19
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,635
It's probably not like the
house that you grew up in,

20
00:00:41,635 --> 00:00:44,010
just like the website you work
on is different from, say,

21
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,420
the person over there.

22
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,890
But some things are the same.

23
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,540
You have maybe a
place you sleep.

24
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,490
Maybe there's a dining room.

25
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,260
Then something
breaks, like the AC,

26
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,460
you might say,
well, I can fix it.

27
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,180
And your friend might
say, no, you should just

28
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,440
call somebody, all right?

29
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,690
Over time, when
you moved in, when

30
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,290
you moved to that
new platform, it

31
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,840
might look like the room
over here on the left.

32
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,900
But technical
debt, feature creep

33
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,570
because Black Friday and the
holiday season is coming up,

34
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,257
you're trying to get things
in, and you get kind of messy.

35
00:01:13,257 --> 00:01:15,090
And I think that a house
is a great metaphor

36
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,380
because it's like an
e-commerce site these days.

37
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,410
It's not just about landing
in one place and you're done.

38
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,368
It's about the journey.

39
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:21,812
You're going from room to room.

40
00:01:21,812 --> 00:01:23,520
You're going from a
page to another page,

41
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,659
from the home page to the search
page to the checkout page.

42
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:28,950
And if the room is like this,
you get kind of confused.

43
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,590
You don't want your user to feel
confused and get lost in it.

44
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,120
So it's time to remodel.

45
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,210
Maybe you need to
upgrade your foundations.

46
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,950
Obviously, to
remodel, we've talked

47
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,470
about a lot of different
things throughout today

48
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,720
and other talks,
things like that,

49
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,480
and like all tools
in the tool box,

50
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,850
things like Progressive
Web Apps, AMP,

51
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,440
Google sign in, Google
Page-- they're great tools.

52
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,200
But just like I
can't go to the store

53
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,750
and buy a power drill that
I saw a great commercial of,

54
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,130
and be like, I'm going
to nail this remodel.

55
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,280
I could very well
destroy everything.

56
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,280
So like all tools,
just because they fit--

57
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,710
they're kind of
like puzzle pieces.

58
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,400
The two pieces fit, but you
might not be actually making

59
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,449
progress towards a big picture.

60
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,050
So what's the big picture?

61
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,340
So at Google, we like to
say, focus on the user

62
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,790
and all else follows.

63
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,095
And so we really think
that that full picture

64
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,470
you're building
towards, whatever

65
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,570
you choose to do in
the e-commerce journey,

66
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,390
you need to improve
user friction.

67
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,090
Think about if you're trying to
add service workers, if you're

68
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,970
trying to try some of the
cool, new APIs, and like, WebXR

69
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:29,930
and things like that.

70
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,820
How is your solution actually
improving the user's journey?

71
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,920
Because there's no
silver bullet here.

72
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,340
To talk about this is Ramya.

73
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,210
You had an example?

74
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,410
RAMYA RAGHAVAN: Of course.

75
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,710
Saatva is a company that
sells luxury mattresses.

76
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,440
And they wanted to ensure
that their users have

77
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,890
a very smooth and fast
online shopping experience.

78
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:53,600
They decided to use AMP as
a technology to enable that.

79
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,030
In their first iteration
of their product details

80
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,390
pages where they created the
AMP portion of that page,

81
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,750
the user had actually to
click from the AMP page

82
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,120
to the product details
page and then click again

83
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,800
to get to the cart page.

84
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,720
They realized that this was
not the best user experience.

85
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,220
So in their second iteration,
they changed the design such

86
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,640
that the user can see the
full details of the product

87
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,210
within the AMP page and be
able to click to add to cart,

88
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:23,220
and even see the cart
from the same page.

89
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,390
This resulted in a reduction
of friction for the user,

90
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,730
going from three taps to
two all in the same page

91
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,640
instead of three pages earlier.

92
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,620
The results were astounding.

93
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,510
Between the two
iterations of AMP,

94
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,360
they saw a 50% improvement
in conversions.

95
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,350
CHENEY TSAI: Thanks.

96
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,340
So it's not just AMP.

97
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,650
If you're creating things
like a Progressive Web App,

98
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,850
you might run into this too.

99
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,640
So here's an example
from Expedia.

100
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,370
Expedia has been working on a
brand new front-end platform.

101
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:53,631
It's four times faster on
slow 3G, on lower end devices.

102
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:54,380
It's really great.

103
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,110
And their CEO even recently
said in their earnings

104
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,065
call that speed benefits
deliver conversion benefits.

105
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:01,940
Usually, we'll say,
we're going to stop here.

106
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,220
Great case study.

107
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,720
Instead, we're going to go into
an interesting learning they

108
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,430
had as part of this process.

109
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,490
So Expedia, like many of the
sites that you might work on,

110
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,632
is a large e-commerce site.

111
00:04:11,632 --> 00:04:14,090
They're not just going to move
from one old platform that's

112
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,394
clearly working over to
a new platform overnight.

113
00:04:16,394 --> 00:04:18,019
They need to do this
in a piecemeal way

114
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:21,260
because maybe some teams
are on a new platform.

115
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,192
They have to socialize
it to other teams.

116
00:04:23,192 --> 00:04:24,650
And so in doing
that, they actually

117
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,290
learned an interesting lesson.

118
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,490
Users value consistency.

119
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,160
So some users during
the migration process,

120
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,020
they landed on the
old experience.

121
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,640
And then, after
clicking around, you

122
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,190
get put into the new
experience that's faster.

123
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,470
And they might move back
and forth a couple of times.

124
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,610
That population, to no surprise,
actually probably did poorer

125
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,430
than if you just stayed in
one experience or another.

126
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,080
It's very much like,
if I was up here,

127
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,345
and I was wearing one brown
shoe and one black shoe,

128
00:04:50,345 --> 00:04:52,490
you probably couldn't
take me quite as seriously

129
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,860
as you're taking me right now.

130
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,210
Hopefully, it's on
the serious side.

131
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:01,400
So I think users value user
journeys that are consistent.

132
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,235
So make sure your solutions,
not only in that page

133
00:05:04,235 --> 00:05:06,800
you're building, but
in the entire journey

134
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,910
and how you're measuring it
is actually reducing friction.

135
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,530
Of course, what
I'm saying, though,

136
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,080
means that if your journey
needs to be consistent

137
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,590
all the way from, say, the entry
point for the search results

138
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,600
page to checkout,
you're probably

139
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,237
going to run into a
lot of challenges.

140
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:24,320
So when we work with a lot
of e-commerce partners,

141
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,984
we run into three
main challenges.

142
00:05:25,984 --> 00:05:27,650
Number one is something
that many of you

143
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,080
probably think about,
organizational alignment.

144
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,190
Then you get to
technical approach,

145
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,460
and then finally, measurement.

146
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,918
And so we'll talk
about that today.

147
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,410
RAMYA RAGHAVAN: Of course.

148
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,150
Let's talk about
the first challenge,

149
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,370
organizational alignment.

150
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,470
When I talk to people
in e-commerce companies

151
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,260
and ask them, do you think
investing in performance

152
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,830
projects to improve user
experience will help improve

153
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:54,080
your core business metrics,
the answer is an immediate yes.

154
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,620
However, when it comes time
to prioritizing performance

155
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,140
projects, there's
always several hurdles--

156
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,040
lack of time, lack of
resources, you name it.

157
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,410
One of the key ingredients
that's missing here

158
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,740
is organizational alignment.

159
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,310
Performance is not just
an engineering priority.

160
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,210
Why?

161
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,950
Consider this.

162
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,070
Your content creation team
wants to generate great content

163
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,660
for the users to consume.

164
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,550
However, they
might create images

165
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,376
that are too heavy
or not optimized

166
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:26,750
because they are not going
through the image optimization

167
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,100
layer.

168
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,200
The marketing team
spends several dollars

169
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,600
to bring traffic to the
site and care deeply

170
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,260
about the user experience.

171
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,740
However, they might
also have tags

172
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,190
that are either old or
redundant or obsolete.

173
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,670
The design team cares very
much about that end-to-end

174
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,660
experience, but they might have
some really cool new features

175
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,210
that do not use
shared competence.

176
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,610
In each of these
scenarios, one thing

177
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,890
is clear, which is
that performance

178
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:58,310
needs to be a priority
among every team that

179
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:03,160
affects the website and
cares about user experience.

180
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,490
Let's look at two
approaches, a top-down

181
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,200
and a bottom-up
approach, in order

182
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,540
to create organizational
alignment.

183
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,360
And we'll do this using
two examples of partners,

184
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,810
1-800-Flowers, which is a
global flower brand, and then

185
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,910
JustFly, which is a
Canadian travel agency.

186
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:23,660
1-800-Flowers believed that
the modern marketing department

187
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,420
is really marketing
plus technology.

188
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,840
This is a very big
shift in mindset.

189
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,490
And what they did was to break
out of organizational silos

190
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,920
and create a
cross-functional team that

191
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,680
comprised of product,
marketing, design

192
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,540
development, and analytics.

193
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,480
This was led by the
CMO of the company.

194
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,270
And they were given a
very clear shared goal,

195
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,930
which was to drive
growth for the company

196
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,250
by investing in the emerging
product experiences.

197
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,200
This allowed this
cross-functional team

198
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,160
to work really closely to
invest not just in one or two,

199
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,910
but almost the entire spectrum
of modern web technologies.

200
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,420
And as you can see, this
yielded some great results.

201
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,540
Seeing a 50% uplift in
conversions does not come easy.

202
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,900
Let's look at the
other example, JustFly.

203
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,390
Even if you don't have
a top-down mandate,

204
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,510
you can use data to
kind of prove your case

205
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,490
and get that consensus.

206
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,260
JustFly did just that.

207
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,030
They started off with
bite-sized proof of concepts

208
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,789
and experiments and
got the consensus

209
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:36,280
amongst their management
and cross-functional teams

210
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,070
to invest in a [INAUDIBLE].

211
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,990
They started off with
this high-level goal

212
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,200
of improving the booking
experience on their site.

213
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,120
And they used data
and experiments

214
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,290
for just about everything, from
testing different GSA libraries

215
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,770
to testing different
checkout flows and design.

216
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,320
And also, they had [? at ?]
[? the ?] [? home ?]

217
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,870
[? screen ?] icon being
[INAUDIBLE] by a few users

218
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,650
to see how those users behave
differently from others.

219
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,840
And with all of this
data, they not only

220
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,570
got the buy-in from
product and marketing,

221
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,260
but they also got the head count
they needed to build the PWA.

222
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,470
And they merged the code
bases of two of their brands

223
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,210
so that they could
launch both of them

224
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,800
as a PWA in the same
time frame that it

225
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,410
would have taken for one.

226
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,010
Now, that's efficiency.

227
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,050
And as you can see, with a
35% improvement in bookings,

228
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,290
this is a great result for them.

229
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,540
All in all, whether you
use a top-down approach

230
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,540
or a bottom-up approach, it's
important to keep in mind

231
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,740
that organizational alignment
is key to not just prioritizing

232
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,990
your performance
projects, but also to gain

233
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,330
the right visibility
so that everybody

234
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:47,680
that cares about user experience
also cares about your project.

235
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,830
CHENEY TSAI: Well, once you
get the organizational buy-in,

236
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,140
you still have to
build the project.

237
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,660
So we're not here today to
talk about all different ways

238
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,530
to build a great Progressive Web
App or a modern web experience.

239
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,140
We'll share a little bit
of these successful traits

240
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,660
we see of good projects
we see out there.

241
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,260
One big pattern is
that we see success

242
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,420
in having a long-term
vision and then

243
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,420
having achievable goals
towards that vision.

244
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,420
To give an example--

245
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,120
so I was recently in
Spain with my wife,

246
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,884
and we visited la Sagrada
Familia over in Barcelona.

247
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,425
I think it's a great
example of this.

248
00:10:20,425 --> 00:10:23,500
This has been under construction
for five generations.

249
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,530
And yet, it still adheres
to the original architect,

250
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,300
Gaudi's, original vision.

251
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,190
Despite that, even
though it's still

252
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,680
under construction to this
day, it opens its doors

253
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,206
to 2.5 million tourists a year.

254
00:10:34,206 --> 00:10:36,580
It's actually very much like
some of the e-commerce sites

255
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,990
that you have.

256
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,960
On Black Friday, not only are
people going to check out,

257
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,950
you probably are running
like 2.5 million A/B tests

258
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,594
through some platform.

259
00:10:46,594 --> 00:10:48,010
So I think it's
really interesting

260
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,190
to think about that.

261
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,910
And a lot of teams have
that long-term vision,

262
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,590
and they often tell
me that, yeah, we

263
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,570
want to get that
time-to-interactive

264
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,100
to under five seconds.

265
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,170
But oftentimes,
you find yourself,

266
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,540
we ran Lighthouse and we're
really far away from it.

267
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,570
And what happens is, well,
we'll get there someday.

268
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,840
And then there's nothing
achievable to get there.

269
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,660
It's just something you see off
in the distance in the horizon.

270
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,400
Oftentimes, they come back
and say, well, we're just

271
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,870
going to have short-term goals.

272
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,810
And this is great.

273
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,110
They have sprints or
everything to get quick wins.

274
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,180
And not to say quick
wins aren't bad,

275
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,400
but oftentimes, you kind of get
into this internal cycle of,

276
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,660
well, there's a deadline here.

277
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,245
It's something we can achieve
before the holiday season.

278
00:11:26,245 --> 00:11:27,370
And then that's all you do.

279
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,070
You go in the circles or you
regress after it a little bit.

280
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:34,240
It's really important that you
have both a long-term vision

281
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,250
and a short-term
goal and you make

282
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,940
sure that they are
actually related,

283
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,900
that the short-term goals is
making meaningful progress

284
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,799
towards a long-term vision.

285
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,590
Let's make this a little
bit more concrete.

286
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,131
We all like to say it up on the
stage with the other speakers

287
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:50,030
that one of the visions
is to improve speed.

288
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,040
Obviously, what does that mean?

289
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,720
There's a lot different
ways to measure.

290
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,230
So let's go back to what I
was saying earlier from a user

291
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,070
perspective.

292
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:00,940
Improving speed might be to
focus on user navigations.

293
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,000
So when we say you want to
optimize your cold page load,

294
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,260
or maybe your return page load
to see if you're using caching,

295
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,150
or if you're comparing
single-page app

296
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,070
to multi-page app,
a lot of things

297
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,070
we're talking about that
ease, that latency between me

298
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,440
clicking on the user
interface and the response

299
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,210
in your UI of
something showing up.

300
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,560
So let's talk about
speed in that regard.

301
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,250
So to go back to the
house really quickly,

302
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,800
I think doors are a
great kind of example

303
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,110
of what navigation is.

304
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,800
An e-commerce site--
it's like a house.

305
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,247
You move from room to room.

306
00:12:31,247 --> 00:12:33,580
You might come in through the
back door, the front door,

307
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,720
or something like that.

308
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,580
And throughout the
process, to complete

309
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,830
the journey in the house,
like to complete the journey

310
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,020
on your website, you
move from room to room.

311
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,590
On Thanksgiving, you're holding
the hot turkey in the kitchen.

312
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,590
Do you want to mess around
with the door on the left

313
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,300
here where you have
to find one key

314
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,883
and then grab another key to get
through the door in the back?

315
00:12:51,883 --> 00:12:53,590
It's probably not
the door you want.

316
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,420
Likewise, there are
probably experiences

317
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,753
in your e-commerce journey
where you don't want the user

318
00:12:57,753 --> 00:12:59,800
during sorting,
filtering, or searching

319
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,160
to have to kind of pay the
cost of that locked door.

320
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,890
There might be a good place for
you to have a door on the right

321
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:06,460
here.

322
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,560
I'm not saying that it's always
client-side routing or anything

323
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,851
like that, but there are
different techniques of making

324
00:13:10,851 --> 00:13:12,700
that as seamless as possible.

325
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,600
So let's jump into three
examples from Walmart, eBay,

326
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,030
and Airbnb, who are in different
parts of this modern web

327
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,760
journey, and kind of dive
into how they're breaking down

328
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,930
this process.

329
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,790
Walmart's a great example--

330
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,040
extremely leading
e-commerce site,

331
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,550
and it recently made a North
Star Goal to reduce time

332
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,340
to interactive by 70%
on low-end devices,

333
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,311
such as the iPhone
6s and Moto G4.

334
00:13:35,311 --> 00:13:37,560
And this is an extremely
aggressive goal to going back

335
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,890
to what I was saying earlier.

336
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,590
But I liked that they were
able to kind of make that goal.

337
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,222
So they organized a bunch of
product and engineering teams

338
00:13:44,222 --> 00:13:45,930
to make meaningful
progress towards that.

339
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:49,200
And then in the last couple of
months, they got 25% of the way

340
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,480
there with improvement
on some pages.

341
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,690
But just because you make
good progress from 0% to 25%

342
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,940
doesn't mean just making
quick wins or the same process

343
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,600
is going to take
you from 25% to 70%.

344
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,450
But that work is important
because in that work they did,

345
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,700
they were able to show
significant business

346
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,860
improvement and use
that to socialize it

347
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,120
across their teams.

348
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,150
But what do I mean by
going from 25% to 75%

349
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,490
might not be quite as simple?

350
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,730
Take this.

351
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,060
It's not really my kind of
room, but let's say it is.

352
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,820
I could organize this room by
just taking some books out,

353
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,684
and reshuffling, and making sure
they're all in the same order.

354
00:14:23,684 --> 00:14:25,350
But if I was going
to take that strategy

355
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,100
and do that for
everything in this room,

356
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,974
I don't know if I'll
make meaningful progress

357
00:14:28,974 --> 00:14:29,970
and finish in time.

358
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,020
If I'm going to
clean up this room,

359
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,130
I might actually
say, well, look,

360
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,320
this is kind of how I would
like one shelf to look like,

361
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,110
but let's kind of take
all the books away,

362
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,734
move the shelves
around to actually get

363
00:14:37,734 --> 00:14:39,635
a nice looking place.

364
00:14:39,635 --> 00:14:41,760
Likewise, what Walmart's
doing is that because they

365
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,392
had a North Star Goal and
they made short-term progress,

366
00:14:44,392 --> 00:14:46,350
they're now able to start
thinking about, well,

367
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,450
what other larger shifts
can we take to get

368
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,830
to the goal we want to do?

369
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,480
Is it building a
Progressive Web App?

370
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,647
Is it adding service workers
in some meaningful way?

371
00:14:53,647 --> 00:14:55,229
I think we're really
interested to see

372
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:57,840
kind of what they're going
to work on in the next year.

373
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,450
Speaking of service
workers, eBay

374
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,850
is actually using one of the
service worker techniques

375
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,670
to improve user
navigation on their site.

376
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,710
So in one of the
earlier talks, we

377
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,720
talked about how you
can use service workers

378
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,250
to improve user navigations.

379
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,790
There's lots of different ways.

380
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,682
eBay is just using
one potential way,

381
00:15:14,682 --> 00:15:16,140
and they're testing
this right now.

382
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,180
So they're doing predictive
prefetching of listing pages.

383
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,820
So for example, right now,
if I go to eBay, and say,

384
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,400
I'm looking for a camera
for Christmas for my dad--

385
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,650
and dad, you didn't hear that.

386
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,700
I don't think you're tuning in.

387
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,840
So right now, if I see a
camera in the search results,

388
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,750
I have to wait until I
click on the listing,

389
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,360
and then the browser makes
another HTML request,

390
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,100
and I'm waiting
for that as a user.

391
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,960
And depending on what
connection I'm in,

392
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,760
that could take a long time.

393
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,809
Well, eBay's like, if we could
predict with high accuracy what

394
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:47,850
you're likely to click
on-- you're going to click

395
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,440
on this camera right here.

396
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,720
What if we post message
to this service worker

397
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,047
that particular file you need.

398
00:15:53,047 --> 00:15:55,380
And then the service worker
is pulling in the background

399
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,360
while I'm considering
which camera to click on

400
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,911
so that when I do
click on it, well,

401
00:15:58,911 --> 00:16:01,410
it's already there on my phone
so that when I click through,

402
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,610
it's as instantaneous of
a navigation as possible.

403
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,800
Of course, what if you
don't have a service worker

404
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,420
architecture yet
already in place?

405
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,150
You're waiting on Q3
for that to be done.

406
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:16,260
Or maybe some of the quick wins
for initial page load might not

407
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,970
be there and you're
kind of stuck there.

408
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,340
Because you have a long-term
vision of improving user

409
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,070
navigation, you might run
into a wall at some point

410
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,210
of a short-term goal.

411
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,710
Because you have
that setup, you can

412
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,200
start thinking about
different ways of getting

413
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,370
to that long-term vision.

414
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,860
And this is kind of where Airbnb
is kind of thinking about.

415
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,400
So Airbnb is like, well,
sometimes rebooting

416
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,770
that JavaScript location
on every single page

417
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,860
might be a cost we don't want
every single page load to be.

418
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,566
So they saw that,
what if we can only

419
00:16:43,566 --> 00:16:44,940
update certain
parts of the page,

420
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,610
say, in the search results so
that only that refreshes, only

421
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,710
that shows up when the
user clicks on something?

422
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,251
In doing this, they
actually measured

423
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:54,050
the user-perceived
speed of that load.

424
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,010
And they saw that loading
the search results

425
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:59,272
page in that manner was a seven
to eight time improvement.

426
00:16:59,272 --> 00:17:01,230
And so let's say they
start diverting more user

427
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,930
traffic to take advantage
of client-side routing

428
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,230
so that now 88% of
search results loads

429
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,655
are leveraging the seven to
eight times speed improvement.

430
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:11,113
Because at the end
of the day, it's

431
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,530
the user's journey that matters.

432
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,369
Hopefully this is
a quick example

433
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,910
of how you can keep an eye on
long-term vision, wherever that

434
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,609
may be, set short-term goals,
and realize that there are

435
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,109
a lot of different
ways when you hit

436
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:24,810
different walls in those
short-term goals of getting

437
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,072
to that long-term vision.

438
00:17:27,072 --> 00:17:29,280
RAMYA RAGHAVAN: Let's talk
about the third challenge,

439
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,690
measurement.

440
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,130
Let me ask you something.

441
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,810
Please raise your
hands if you've ever

442
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,940
worked on a project
with great potential

443
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,700
to improve user
experience, but the plug

444
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,750
got pulled at some point because
you couldn't prove the impact.

445
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,681
Anyone?

446
00:17:44,681 --> 00:17:46,590
That's quite a few of us.

447
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:49,530
And this is certainly
not uncommon, right?

448
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:53,130
Even if you have a great
organizational alignment

449
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,470
and a good technical
approach to your project,

450
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,720
if you don't have the
right measurement strategy,

451
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,697
it could still fail.

452
00:18:00,697 --> 00:18:03,030
Because of this, even though
this is the third challenge

453
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:06,120
we are covering here today,
this is one of the first things

454
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,520
that I've seen
successful companies do

455
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,810
in terms of thinking about
their performance project.

456
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:17,010
A good measurement strategy is
one that is shared, automated,

457
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,510
and actionable.

458
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,650
What do I mean by that?

459
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,630
It needs to have shared metrics.

460
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:26,950
To Cheney's earlier point, when
you have the North Star Goal,

461
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,960
you need to have
specific metrics that

462
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,320
are mapped to that North
Star Goal that are also

463
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,790
shared amongst people that care
about that user experience.

464
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:42,720
Having these shared
metrics is really crucial,

465
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,310
and you have to
define it in a way

466
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,130
that people understand
exactly what those metrics are

467
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,410
and how they are calculated.

468
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,240
The second piece here
is automated tools.

469
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,480
These tools are necessary, not
just to measure these metrics,

470
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,190
but also monitor them over
time so that you can gain

471
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,720
real good insights from them.

472
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,270
And once you have
those tools, it's

473
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:06,870
important to understand, what
are the actionable next steps?

474
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,270
Now that I have this
insight, what changes

475
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:12,766
can I make in order to
meet that North Star Goal?

476
00:19:12,766 --> 00:19:15,390
Let's dive into shared metrics
a little bit deeper because it's

477
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,630
often not as well understood.

478
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,110
When I talk about mapping
goals to specific metrics,

479
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,240
we have these four
big milestones

480
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,180
when we talk about a
user journey in terms

481
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,480
of acquisition, engagement,
conversion, and re-engagement.

482
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,240
Let's focus more on
the conversion piece.

483
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,270
Let's say you really wanted a
seamless checkout experience

484
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,650
for your users.

485
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:42,330
One way to measure that is to
think about the average time

486
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:46,170
that it takes for, let's
say, 90% of your users

487
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:51,480
to go from that cart page to
the order completion page.

488
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,490
Understanding from
a user perspective

489
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,500
how easy or difficult
it is for them

490
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,960
to convert when
that intent is clear

491
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,460
is a good way, potentially, for
measuring whether you're having

492
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,320
a seamless checkout flow.

493
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,740
Another important point to
consider is third parties.

494
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,950
Third parties are an integral
part of that user experience

495
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:12,766
on your site.

496
00:20:12,766 --> 00:20:14,140
And therefore,
they should not be

497
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,140
ignored when it comes to
measurement strategy either.

498
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,750
So one way you can hold
your third party accountable

499
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,400
is to say that the
server response

500
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,560
time should be under a certain
budget that you set for them.

501
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,810
All in all, talking
about budgets,

502
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,050
you've been hearing this
term of performance budgets

503
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,810
throughout various
sessions today.

504
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,670
A performance budget
is a framework

505
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:39,180
that allows you to understand
what changes represent progress

506
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:43,080
and what changes
represent regressions.

507
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,040
And it does take into account
the set of shared metrics,

508
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,040
and you have budgets for
each of those metrics, which

509
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:55,350
are shown in this automated
tool and made actionable.

510
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,730
Let's actually
take a look at how

511
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,410
three different
e-commerce companies

512
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:01,200
took this idea of a
performance budget

513
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,330
and implemented it
so well that they

514
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,470
have seen some amazing results.

515
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,720
Are you ready?

516
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,810
OK, Cdiscount is a French
leader in e-commerce

517
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:16,980
that had a problem that is
not very unlike many of us

518
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,390
in e-commerce.

519
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:22,740
They saw a big chunk of
their traffic on mobile,

520
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,830
but they didn't see that
the mobile sales were

521
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,110
at a similar ratio.

522
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,820
They realized that this is
not an easy problem to solve,

523
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,710
right?

524
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:34,080
So they broke
organizational silos,

525
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,150
and they empowered
their marketing team

526
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,730
to run deep analysis
and come up with a set

527
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,950
of shared best practices.

528
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,520
They then implemented these
best practices as budgets

529
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,810
within their tool.

530
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:50,730
And using the integration
between SpeedCurve and Slack,

531
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,460
they ensured that when
the budgets were not met,

532
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,550
automatic alerts would be sent
into the Slack channel which

533
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:59,790
was shared amongst all the
cross-functional teams.

534
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:03,190
By collaborating in making all
of these different changes,

535
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,490
they saw some really,
really good results.

536
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:09,090
Their mobile website
conversion rate

537
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:13,090
was 50% higher than their
native app, which has a 4,

538
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:16,780
4 and 1/2 star in
different app stores.

539
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,680
This is something that all of
us really can relate to, right?

540
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,960
It's not easy to get there.

541
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,930
Let's take another example.

542
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:31,390
Carousell, which is a
Singapore-based online

543
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:36,700
marketplace, used this idea of a
performance budget because they

544
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,720
really wanted their users in
southeast Asian countries where

545
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,290
the predominant
network speed is 3G--

546
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:48,220
they wanted all of those users
to have a great experience

547
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,020
on their site.

548
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,790
And so they started
off with this kind

549
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,230
of performance budget.

550
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:57,280
Note that the first line here
is about the critical rendering

551
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:03,010
path resources bundle
to be under 120 KB.

552
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,770
This is irrespective of
whether that bundle includes

553
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,540
first party or third
party because they

554
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,150
had this commitment
that that bundle needs

555
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:13,370
to be really small.

556
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:16,450
They were so intent upon
following this performance

557
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,550
budget that they
included this as part

558
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:21,010
of their continuous
integration process, such

559
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,930
that the code
could not be merged

560
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:27,820
until this bundle or
this budget was met.

561
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,660
In order to do that, it was
not an easy thing at all,

562
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,040
so they really had to
collaborate very, very

563
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,910
closely with their design, and
marketing, and analytics teams,

564
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,550
and that really paid
off very well, as you

565
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,500
can see in this next slide.

566
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,450
Not only are these
metrics really good,

567
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:46,030
but there's something
here for every team that

568
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,860
was part of this project.

569
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,920
The product team cares
about the page load time.

570
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,580
The marketing team cared
about organic traffic.

571
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,160
The ads team cared about
the click-through rates.

572
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,290
And the transactions
team cared about how many

573
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:01,960
buyers and sellers were
able to chat with each other

574
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,800
to complete their transaction.

575
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,330
So these were great
results all in all.

576
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,120
Let's look at a third example.

577
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,600
As you heard earlier today about
Wayfair, the home goods company

578
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,420
here in the US,
that really wanted

579
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,900
to improve user experience
and make sure that they

580
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,510
sustained that improvement.

581
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:25,300
When they first started off with
the performance budget, which

582
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,060
they said was one of
the most crucial parts

583
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,970
of the measurement
that they did,

584
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,540
it did not take off that much
because these budgets were

585
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:38,410
understood, but it was not
very clear for everybody.

586
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,470
Well, they made so many
changes towards optimizing

587
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,180
their [? inside, ?]
they said that one

588
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,280
of the most important
things they did

589
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,230
was to socialize their budget.

590
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,900
And the way they did
that was to make it clear

591
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,720
using performance indicators,
as you see here in colors.

592
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,400
So this is how it worked.

593
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,330
They had a budget, and they had
an acceptable variance of plus

594
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,720
or minus 10%.

595
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,590
So if you were within that
range, you're in orange.

596
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:07,310
If you exceed that
budget by more than 10%,

597
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,800
then you enter the red area.

598
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,297
And if you're better than
the budget by more than 10%,

599
00:25:12,297 --> 00:25:13,380
then you've hit your goal.

600
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,650
Congratulations, you're a green.

601
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:20,720
They also had a competitor
line, just to make things fun.

602
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,270
This is how it looked
for all internal users

603
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,760
when they looked at
their specific pages

604
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,120
since the budgets were
set at a page-type level

605
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,760
for every route in the site.

606
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,510
So the moment you look at your
mobile site within the company,

607
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:38,330
you were able to see
these indicators that

608
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:42,970
told you whether you are in
the red, green, or orange.

609
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,660
As you can see
here, the way they

610
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:48,970
set these budgets was the moment
you hit the goal reliably,

611
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,680
your budget, and
therefore, goal,

612
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,920
which was always 10%
better than the budget,

613
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,240
tightened up a little bit.

614
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,270
You can see that over here,
where once you hit the goal,

615
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:02,080
the bar was raised, so
to speak, and it actually

616
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,760
tightened up over there.

617
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,650
By the way, isn't
this the kind of graph

618
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:10,000
we all want to see, going from
2.3 seconds to 0.9 seconds?

619
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,950
That's really awesome.

620
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,240
This is a performance portal.

621
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,830
As you can see, in
this portal, they

622
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:21,100
had a clear set
of shared metrics.

623
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,820
Not just the metrics, but
also the page level indicator,

624
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,150
and they have a call to
action at the bottom for users

625
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:31,200
to basically reach
out to a Slack channel

626
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,950
if they had questions
about these metrics.

627
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,830


628
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:39,360
Whether you're trying to use
a performance budget idea

629
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,780
or trying to use the general
idea of a shared metrics

630
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:46,270
automated tool and
actionable next steps,

631
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,030
thinking about your
measurement strategy

632
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,950
at the beginning
of your project is

633
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:53,060
crucial to the success
of the project.

634
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,770
Another thing to remember
about performance budgets

635
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:58,020
is that it needs
governance to think

636
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,480
about the metrics at
a page or route level,

637
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,540
and also to maintain those
budgets and metrics as moving

638
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,620
targets as you go forward.

639
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,800
It also needs to be
enforced in a way

640
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,630
that everybody can come together
to meet or beat those budgets.

641
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:17,976
And that makes it
very, very successful.

642
00:27:17,976 --> 00:27:19,600
CHENEY TSAI: We would
love to go deeper

643
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,210
into some of these partner
stories, but true to form,

644
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:25,790
we might be slightly above our
performance budget for time.

645
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:29,470
So hopefully you learned
something from today's talk.

646
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:32,020
I think we want to focus on
making sure your tools actually

647
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,840
improve the user journey.

648
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,120
And along the way, you might
run into these three problems,

649
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,420
org alignment, technical
approach, measurement.

650
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,230
This isn't anything
new to us, and we

651
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,730
hope some of these
partner examples

652
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:45,910
help you move a little
further along on that journey.

653
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,410
RAMYA RAGHAVAN:
Which means you need

654
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:50,020
to do something differently
the next time you work

655
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,260
on a performance project
to build consensus

656
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,660
and visibility for
your project, to cross

657
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,660
those technical hurdles to
reach the North Star Goal,

658
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,240
and also, not just
to prove the impact,

659
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,100
but also to sustain
the improvement

660
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,710
that you've worked so hard for.

661
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,570
When you have all of
these considerations

662
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:10,600
for your project, I'm sure that
working on performance projects

663
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,240
can be very exciting
and rewarding,

664
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,060
as many of these
partners would attest to.

665
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:19,150
I'd like to say a special thanks
for all of these partners that

666
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,730
allowed us to share their
stories with you today

667
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,890
and many others who've
influenced this talk

668
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,450
in some way or another.

669
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:27,160
We would love to
hear more from you

670
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,170
and your specific
challenges when

671
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:31,760
you're trying to adopt
modern web technologies.

672
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,060
Please come find us at
the [INAUDIBLE] section

674
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:35,590
Thank you.

675
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,881
