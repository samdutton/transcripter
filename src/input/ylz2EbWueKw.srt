00:00:06,552 --> 00:00:08,010
CHRIS WILSON: So
I am Chris Wilson.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,718
I'm here with my
colleague, John Pallett,

4
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:11,170
who will be out in a minute.

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,980
And we're here to talk about
the next great platform,

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,079
the Immersive Web.

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,450
And this is actually not
running off my laptop,

8
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,160
so hopefully I won't
have any problems.

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,700
At least they won't be mine.

10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,450
Now we talk about this
word immersive a lot,

11
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,840
and I want to define what I
meant by the immersive web.

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,360
And at this point, I think
pretty much everyone has heard

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,100
of virtual reality at least.

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,892
Hands up, who saw
"Ready Player One "?

15
00:00:37,892 --> 00:00:39,706
That's actually a
really small percentage.

16
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,580
You should go see it.

17
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,329
It's a good movie.

18
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:42,350
It's good entertainment.

19
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,390
So it's totally just like that.

20
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,520
Well, not really,
but virtual reality

21
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,490
is all about immersing yourself
in a completely alternate

22
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,210
reality, putting what I refer
to as the reality blinders on,

23
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,680
completely replacing everything
you can see and usually here,

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,980
and immersing yourself in
this totally different world.

25
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,700
That world may be a game.

26
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,030
It can be like
visualizing a data set.

27
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,120
It can be a virtual workspace.

28
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,695
My kids like to play this game
where I put on a VR headset

29
00:01:11,695 --> 00:01:13,070
and they see how
close to me they

30
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,550
can dance before I notice that
they're there, which usually

31
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,609
it's pretty close.

32
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:19,400
But certainly, when
I'm at my desk at work,

33
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,310
this is my favorite place
to go into VR, because it

34
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,170
masks everything off around me.

35
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,590
The sea of cubicles
isn't there anymore.

36
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,440
And you usually
experience virtual reality

37
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,370
through a tethered VR
headset, like a Vive or Rift,

38
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,070
standalone devices
like the Oculus Go,

39
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:41,480
or smartphone VR systems,
like Daydream View, Gear VR,

40
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,940
or Google Cardboard,
my personal favorite.

41
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,490
And any of these devices
end up using a combination

42
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,700
of head tracking,
screen display, optics,

43
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,220
and controllers to make
you feel like you're

44
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,740
present in a totally
different world.

45
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,390
Now, at Google,
we've been working

46
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:01,580
on exposing this to the web for
really quite a long time on all

47
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,820
these devices, from high
end desktop headsets

48
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,449
on Windows to a polyfill
that supports WebVR

49
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:11,000
on any smartphone in Cardboard.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,210
Yes, even Safari on iPhones.

51
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,730
And, in fact, you may not
even have a VR headset.

52
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:21,150
You might not even have this
$0.29 worth of cardboard.

53
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,550
WebXR and the XR polyfill can
actually view VR worlds just

54
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,060
on a mobile device using the
accelerometer and orientation

55
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,960
API.

56
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,150
So you can look
around a 3D scene.

57
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,670
And this lets the users
look around your 3D world

58
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:39,610
even if they don't want to drop
their phone into a headset.

59
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:44,430
Now, in addition to bringing
VR to the web, we also--

60
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,640
my team actually works on
bringing the web into VR,

61
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,290
at least on Daydream devices.

62
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,720
Starting with Chrome
67, you can actually

63
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,500
launch a VR version of Chrome
inside the Daydream home

64
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,720
screen, and we put a
lot of work into making

65
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,110
browsing the traditional 2D
web a really great experience.

66
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:07,050
But, of course, the really cool
part is when the browser in VR

67
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,510
can be used to browse
immersive worlds.

68
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,840
You can hop back and forth
between the 2D web and VR

69
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,900
content that's hosted
directly on the web.

70
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,310
So this gives you a really
great easy experience

71
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,470
and really, actually,
totally immersive.

72
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:27,420
It's like you're just
navigating inside that world.

73
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,220
Now, having a browser inside
the VR world is so useful.

74
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,430
It turns out 83%
of Daydream users

75
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,310
also regularly use
the browser in VR.

76
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,620
This was something we
added on after the fact.

77
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,970
Daydream shipped
without a browser.

78
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,650
And now this is a regular
occurrence for most of them.

79
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,960
It shows how important
the content from the web

80
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,864
is, even when you're just
living inside a VR world.

81
00:03:53,864 --> 00:03:55,780
But enough about virtual
reality for a second.

82
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,560
I want to talk about when
you don't want those reality

83
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,432
blinders on.

84
00:04:00,432 --> 00:04:02,140
I actually like to
interact with my kids.

85
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,681
I want to be able
to see them and not

86
00:04:03,681 --> 00:04:05,410
have them dance in front of me.

87
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,530
And the most exciting extension
of the computing platform,

88
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,770
to me, is the concept
of augmented reality,

89
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:16,269
not just overlaying AR stickers
and animated characters

90
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:19,700
or being able to drop virtual
objects into your reality.

91
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,029
The key to understanding
AR's potential

92
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,720
is that it's really about
the concept of your computer

93
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,840
getting to see, getting
to see a world around you,

94
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,960
interpret parts of it, find
surfaces, in the future,

95
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,600
recognize objects,
and then augment

96
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,650
that reality with virtual
bits of user experience.

97
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,470
Instead of trying to totally
replace your reality,

98
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,500
we really want computers
to just convincingly blend

99
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,640
virtual and real experiences.

100
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,350
Now, for AR, there
are some headsets,

101
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,700
like the Hololens,
the Magic Leap One.

102
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:59,140
There are projection systems to
display on real-world surfaces.

103
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,990
But most users will
probably first experience AR

104
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,060
like I did, using a
camera passthrough

105
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,370
experience on a mobile
device showing things

106
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,010
like AR stickers.

107
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,260
And the cool thing is, if
you think of the things

108
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:16,210
the web is really, really good
at, the long tail of software,

109
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:20,320
content, products you expect
from the web, the experiences

110
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,440
that users will
probably happily click

111
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,750
on but they wouldn't
necessarily install

112
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,480
on their devices, the
massive success of the web

113
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,110
as a commerce platform
is a huge, huge benefit.

114
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,690
You can start to see
how enabling developers

115
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,400
to build immersive
experiences that

116
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,280
are delivered in this
really ephemeral fashion

117
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,960
is a fantastic idea.

118
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,620
You don't have to install an app
to see how that couch is going

119
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,820
to look in your living room.

120
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,090
You don't have to install an
app to view an immersive video

121
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,330
trailer.

122
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,630
The ephemerality of the
web makes the ability

123
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,980
to do these immersive
experiences a fantastic match.

124
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,000
And our mission,
John's and mine,

125
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,180
is really to enable web
developers to break that plane,

126
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,430
break out of the
flat design world

127
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,140
that we've been
living in for so long

128
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:09,420
to enable these truly
immersive experiences.

129
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,370
And to enable that,
we really needed

130
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,140
to start with the
baseline, being

131
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,100
able to connect immersive
displays and render to them.

132
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,520
And that's where the
WebXR device API comes in.

133
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,160
This replaces the old WebVR API.

134
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,840
It evolves those concepts to
expose not just VR but also AR

135
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,200
functionality, and in true,
extensible web platform

136
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:32,960
layering.

137
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,020
This is really the
underpinning only.

138
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,650
This lets us connect to those
devices, render displays,

139
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,620
understand which
way they're pointed,

140
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,390
interact with controllers,
that kind of stuff.

141
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:48,550
And this is a really
broad multi-year effort

142
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,500
by a bunch of
different companies.

143
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,430
Google, Mozilla, Microsoft,
Samsung, Amazon, Oculus,

144
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,320
a whole bunch of others
as well have been

145
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,800
working on this for a while.

146
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,280
And this has all been developed,
by the way, in the W3C.

147
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,520
In fact, we have a brand new
immersive web working group.

148
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,790
I personally co-chair this with
my colleague, Ada Rose Cannon,

149
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,430
who's sitting right
down here in the front--

150
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,830
I just had to make her blush--

151
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,830
from Samsung.

152
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,520
And we're tasked
with taking this spec

153
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,530
to an actual final status.

154
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,960
And this is why we
created a working group,

155
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,840
because we feel it's super
important to actually land this

156
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,210
now and not just keep
talking about how

157
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,340
cool it could be in the future.

158
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,130
This really shows the
maturing of this API,

159
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,050
because it's moving
closer and closer

160
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,730
to becoming a final standard.

161
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,760
And, of course, we also
continue to incubate new ideas

162
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,460
in the immersive web
with the community group.

163
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,720
Now, if you want to experiment
with WebXR API today,

164
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,350
you can enable it with Chrome's
flags, with the about flags.

165
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,210
If you want to try
out AR scenarios,

166
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,965
you have to enable
this second flag.

167
00:07:53,965 --> 00:07:55,840
That should be going
away soon, because we've

168
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,230
done some new mode work in the
spec to make that work, too.

169
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,230
We have a currently
running origin trial, too,

170
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:06,070
if you want to try to deploy
this out to normal users,

171
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,920
and, of course, if
you're willing to accept

172
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,200
the responsibility
of making changes

173
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,000
as the spec and our
implementation change.

174
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,520


175
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,070
Now, finally, I've
mentioned the WebXR polyfill

176
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,820
a couple of times.

177
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,403
And this is something
I wanted to give

178
00:08:20,403 --> 00:08:21,580
a little more detail about.

179
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,650
This is a polyfill
JavaScript library

180
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,740
that's maintained by
the community group.

181
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,090
It helps developers in a
couple of different ways.

182
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:33,039
First, it offers a
JavaScript-only implementation

183
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,390
that works for VR scenarios
in any mobile browser using

184
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,830
orientation events.

185
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:42,130
So even mobile Safari,
with cardboard devices

186
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,200
or flat displays,
you can actually

187
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,610
get a WebXR implementation
just through JavaScript.

188
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,760
Secondly, if a browser does
implement the older WebVR

189
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,340
API, like Firefox did this
and Microsoft Edge did this,

190
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,640
it can actually build
XR on top of that.

191
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,720
And you get the hardware
speed of their former WebVR

192
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,920
implementation.

193
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,020
So you can instantly
make your WebXR content

194
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:13,360
accessible to a much wider range
of users with just one script.

195
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,030
Now, with that, I want to
bring out my colleague, John,

196
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,510
who's going to drill down
into the augmented reality

197
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,940
possibilities in
a bit more detail.

198
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,620
Thanks, John.

199
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,786
JOHN PALLETT: Thanks, Chris.

200
00:09:23,786 --> 00:09:29,050


201
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:32,880
So let's talk a little bit more
about augmented reality or AR.

202
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,800
As Chris mentioned,
augmented reality

203
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,350
is largely about being
able to overlay information

204
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,820
over top of the real world.

205
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,320
And if you've tried
out AR stickers,

206
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,570
or if you put masks on
your face on a smartphone,

207
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,839
you've already seen
augmented reality.

208
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:46,380
And the reason for
this is that there

209
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,960
are hundreds of millions
of phones and tablets

210
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,990
out there right now that
support augmented reality,

211
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,590
and the number is growing.

212
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,810
And most of those devices
have web browsers,

213
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:58,230
which means there is a big
opportunity for web developers

214
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,860
here.

215
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,690
And the lowest
hanging fruit, really,

216
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,710
is the ability to add a new
experience to an existing 2D

217
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,520
web page.

218
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,500
So it doesn't require
an entirely new site.

219
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,694
You can add AR capability
to an existing 2D website.

220
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,110
There've been a
number of partners

221
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,390
that have been experimenting
with this using the WebXR

222
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,090
device API and turning
on the hit test flag

223
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,500
that Chris mentioned.

224
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,020
They're doing this in
Chrome Dev and in Canary.

225
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,110
And as one example, Plattar,
which is an augmented reality

226
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,180
platform that lets
businesses put

227
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,369
virtual objects
in the real world,

228
00:10:29,369 --> 00:10:30,660
they've done a couple of demos.

229
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,880
And there's some
interesting ideas here.

230
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,070
On the left, you can see that
users can learn about a product

231
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:42,090
by getting information in
context on the product itself

232
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,190
rather than having to
go through data sheets.

233
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,080
And it actually saves
shipping demo units

234
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,970
to businesses that are
thinking about buying

235
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,980
machinery or heavy equipment.

236
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,714
On the right, you
can see that looking

237
00:10:51,714 --> 00:10:53,880
at objects from different
angles has a lot of value,

238
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,460
in this case, for
fashion, and generally,

239
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,580
for shopping, but also for
education where students

240
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,800
can explore the
object or artifact

241
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,600
that they're learning about.

242
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,180
Now, this doesn't all have
to be in augmented reality.

243
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,180
You could do both of these using
a 3D model on your website.

244
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,100
But if you can put it
into the real world,

245
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,822
you get a better sense of
context as well as scale.

246
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:17,280
Now, what's
interesting, though, is

247
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,569
that, from a user
experience perspective,

248
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:22,110
there are a lot of
interesting things

249
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,670
to learn about
augmented reality,

250
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,622
particularly how
it fits on the web.

251
00:11:26,622 --> 00:11:28,830
And it's a good reason to
start experimenting with it

252
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,990
now if you're thinking
about adding it.

253
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,140
So by way of example,
West Elm, who

254
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,560
sells home decor and furniture,
did some in-store testing.

255
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,350
And what they did was they
went to one of their stores

256
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,540
and they picked four
shoppers at random.

257
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,690
And they showed them a
prototype shopping website that

258
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,610
incorporated augmented reality.

259
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,870
Now this isn't a huge study.

260
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,676
It's four shoppers.

261
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:51,300
But they had some
interesting findings.

262
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,760
And they gave us
permission to share them.

263
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,260
So the first thing
that they learned

264
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:59,140
is with these customers, the
terms AR or augmented reality,

265
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,290
it's not really a
common vocabulary.

266
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,960
Basic terminology,
like view in your room,

267
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,390
is a better way of
telling users what to do.

268
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:09,540
But even then, without a visual
showing what's going to happen,

269
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,100
that text can really get lost
with everything else that

270
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,830
is visual on the site.

271
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,300
So what they're
looking at now is

272
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,222
ways to add both an icon and
text so that the user has

273
00:12:18,222 --> 00:12:18,930
a call to action.

274
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,400
They know what to do.

275
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,224
One approach might be
to have a rotating 3D

276
00:12:22,224 --> 00:12:23,890
model so that the
user understands, hey,

277
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:27,070
this is more than just
another image on the page.

278
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,320
The next thing they learned
is that users get confused

279
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,430
without clear directions.

280
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,820
You can see here that there's a
delay while the user is trying

281
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,600
to figure out what to do.

282
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,220
Do I tap?

283
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,260
Do I move my phone around?

284
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,000
What is this circle
on the floor?

285
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,920
I've never seen this before.

286
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,190
You have to actually guide users
to the path of success here.

287
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,130
And West Elm is researching
clear directions as well

288
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,597
as things like progress
bars and loading indicators

289
00:12:50,597 --> 00:12:52,180
so that users don't
get lost, and they

290
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,388
can see how to get to the
point that they're actually

291
00:12:54,388 --> 00:12:58,970
placing furniture or an
object into the real world.

292
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:02,230
After that, once participants
successfully placed an object,

293
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,430
the most common
request was the ability

294
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,880
to move it or spin it or even
remove it from the scene.

295
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,594
The original placement wasn't
always where they wanted it to.

296
00:13:10,594 --> 00:13:12,260
It wasn't always clear
to users how they

297
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,420
could do that, in this case.

298
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,050
Another thing that they heard
from their test subjects

299
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,570
as well was that
getting validation,

300
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,584
that the size of the virtual
object matched the real world,

301
00:13:23,584 --> 00:13:24,500
would also be helpful.

302
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,760
Because if you're
shopping for furniture,

303
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,801
you want to make sure that
it fits into the space

304
00:13:27,801 --> 00:13:28,530
that you have.

305
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,905
So from that
perspective, showing

306
00:13:29,905 --> 00:13:33,920
some real-world dimensions
with the model could help.

307
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,500
And finally, there
was some feedback

308
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,270
on how real the assets looked.

309
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,430
And now this study was
particularly unique

310
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,305
because West Elm was
doing it in-store.

311
00:13:41,305 --> 00:13:43,930
And so they had the opportunity
to put the virtual object right

312
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:47,710
next to the physical object
and get real shopper feedback.

313
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,200
Generally speaking,
the feedback on realism

314
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,947
here was only about 6 out of 10.

315
00:13:51,947 --> 00:13:53,530
And you can see
clearly that there are

316
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,250
differences between the two.

317
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,610
So West Elm is looking at how
to handle typical lighting

318
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,560
scenarios and also make
sure that the shadows

319
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,018
underneath the object are a
little more pronounced and more

320
00:14:02,018 --> 00:14:03,166
detailed.

321
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,540
So the key message
here really is

322
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,320
that there's a whole lot of
things that you can learn.

323
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,290
There's a lot of
streamlining going on here.

324
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,420
And fundamentally,
augmented reality on the web

325
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,150
has some differences from
apps where somebody might

326
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,130
be installing an
augmented reality app,

327
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:19,210
and so they're discovering it
in a completely different way.

328
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,000
Despite those
challenges, I think

329
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,310
a telling finding
from this study

330
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,080
was that three of
the four participants

331
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,860
said they would absolutely,
10 out of 10, use AR,

332
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,540
once they knew what
that term meant,

333
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,030
to do furniture shopping.

334
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,040
Now, if you're like
me and you grew up

335
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,500
with commercials talking about
three out of four dentists

336
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,150
recommend this
toothpaste, you probably

337
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,760
all wondered, what does
that fourth dentist think?

338
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,590
Does it rot teeth?

339
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:48,180
And the answer here
is actually maybe.

340
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,560
So three people absolutely.

341
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,610
One person maybe.

342
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,697
I personally visualize
that as these

343
00:14:52,697 --> 00:14:54,780
are people shopping for
home decor, and they said,

344
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,410
would you use this?

345
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,430
And they're like maybe.

346
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,720
I'm here to buy a couch.

347
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,550
But I don't actually
think that's how it went.

348
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,330
But the point here is that
three people said absolutely.

349
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,700
Pulled from random, three
people said absolutely.

350
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,631
It's a strong signal.

351
00:15:06,631 --> 00:15:08,130
It's also consistent
with what we've

352
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,260
heard from partners
and users who

353
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,440
see value and be able to
visualize 3D objects ideally

354
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,390
in the real world.

355
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,600
So if you're thinking
about experimenting this

356
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,400
and you're thinking about
adding this to your website,

357
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,830
let's talk a little bit about
how you can build things.

358
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,110
Chris mentioned the flags you
can enable a little bit earlier

359
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,526
in the presentation, but let's
talk about how you actually

360
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,060
add the immersive experience.

361
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,417
So you could write
WebGL code directly.

362
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:33,000
And if you're doing
augmented reality,

363
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,030
that would be over top
of the camera feed.

364
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,410
That's one way you can do it.

365
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,200
Generally, we recommend
using a library to help.

366
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,510
For example, three.js
is a helper library

367
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,280
for 3D graphics
on the web, and it

368
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,280
takes care of a lot of the
heavy lifting for 3D geometry

369
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,420
management and rendering.

370
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,795
And it makes it
so you don't have

371
00:15:49,795 --> 00:15:51,730
to work with WebGL directly.

372
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,327
So let's look at an example
of how three and WebXR can

373
00:15:54,327 --> 00:15:54,910
work together.

374
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,160
We're not going to cover the
whole process of creating

375
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,720
a WebXR session
and doing all that,

376
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,110
but we are going to look at
how a virtual object can be

377
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,400
placed into a real-world scene.

378
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,490
And we're going to do that
with a narrow use case,

379
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,785
in this case, putting a reticle
onto a real world surface.

380
00:16:08,785 --> 00:16:10,660
For those who haven't
heard that term before,

381
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,090
a reticle is an indicator.

382
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,130
In this case, you can see
it as it moves around.

383
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,780
And it's typically
a user interface

384
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,270
construct so that the user
knows what they can do.

385
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,820
You saw some of this in the
West Elm screenshots earlier.

386
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,270
So what we're going to
do first in this case

387
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,850
is take the mesh for the
reticle, which, in our case,

388
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,090
is a flat circle, and we'll
add it to the three scene.

389
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,770
It's worth noting
we'd like the reticle

390
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,630
to be about half a meter wide.

391
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,210
And so it's worth noting
that the WebXR device

392
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,240
API locks the coordinate
system of the real world

393
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,740
to the virtual world.

394
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,300
And what that
means is that, one,

395
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,240
in WebGL or the virtual
space or in three,

396
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,370
one unit is one meter
in the real world.

397
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,060
10 units is 10 meters.

398
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,870
So in this case, if our
mesh is half a unit wide,

399
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:55,920
it means it'll appear as half
a meter in the real world.

400
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,420
Next, what we're
going to want to do

401
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,030
is actually render the
reticle over the camera

402
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,770
on real-world geometry.

403
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,990
But to do that, we need to
know where the real world

404
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,579
geometry is.

405
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:08,339
The WebXR device API
includes the capability

406
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:10,210
to do a hit test,
which is firing

407
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:13,079
a ray into the real world
and getting intersection

408
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,520
points with real-world
surfaces, so, for example,

409
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,994
taking a ray from my
eye, down into the stage,

410
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:20,160
and then getting the
intersection point of where I'm

411
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,740
looking on the stage, but
also the normal facing up,

412
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,030
so I know where the surface is
and what direction it's facing.

413
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,202
Now, in order to do
that, you need a ray.

414
00:17:28,202 --> 00:17:30,660
And a good example of some of
the things three can help you

415
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,780
with is a ray caster function,
which I don't show here.

416
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,360
But it will let you get the
origin and the direction

417
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,860
of the ray that
you're going to fire

418
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,339
into the scene from the camera.

419
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:40,630
So we've already got that here.

420
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,140
And what we're going to do is
pass that into the hit test

421
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,891
API with WebXR.

422
00:17:45,891 --> 00:17:48,140
And then what we'll do is
we'll take the return value.

423
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,300
We'll actually possibly
get a list of things,

424
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,280
because it might be
more than one object

425
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,560
behind the first hit.

426
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,690
We'll take the first
one, the closest,

427
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,210
and we'll convert
the position that we

428
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,580
got into a three.js
matrix, and then

429
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,769
we'll use that to set the
position of the reticle.

430
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:05,060
And at that point, you're done.

431
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,850
The reticle is now positioned
so that it will render directly

432
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:12,129
over the real-world object that
was detected from that ray.

433
00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:13,670
Now, it's worth
reiterating that this

434
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:16,130
works because the virtual
coordinate system matches

435
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,117
the real world one.

436
00:18:17,117 --> 00:18:19,200
And obviously, I skipped
over a lot of steps here,

437
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,491
but the point really is that
you can combine frameworks

438
00:18:21,491 --> 00:18:23,300
like three js with WebXR.

439
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,360
And it's fairly straightforward
if you know 3D programming

440
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,540
basics.

441
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,770
But some of you might not
know 3D programming basics.

442
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,270
And the fact is
that if you've tried

443
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,090
to add a 3D model to
your site, you probably

444
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,740
know already it's
not super easy.

445
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,970
3D models can be pretty complex
both to read and to display.

446
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,610
We saw that, even in
the West Elm example,

447
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,435
there were user
experience considerations.

448
00:18:47,435 --> 00:18:49,810
If you're starting from scratch,
you have to think about,

449
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,226
how do I want to rotate objects,
allow people to move them

450
00:18:52,226 --> 00:18:53,870
around, and so forth?

451
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,810
And then there's also
responsive design.

452
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,944
If you want this to work
on mobile and desktop,

453
00:18:58,944 --> 00:19:00,610
even if you're just
doing a simple model

454
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:04,180
and a turntable view, you have
to know how to handle resizing.

455
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,500
Do you need to display
a poster image on mobile

456
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,070
to prevent the download
of the 3D geometry

457
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,260
until the user
actually wants it?

458
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,080
For newer technology,
like augmented reality,

459
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,750
ideally, you'd be able to take
advantage and progressively

460
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,970
enhance and use some
of the capabilities

461
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,800
on different platforms
even if they're not

462
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,820
available in all browsers.

463
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,892
And as WebXR comes out and
starts moving to stable,

464
00:19:25,892 --> 00:19:27,100
it's one more thing to learn.

465
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,224
It's one more thing to add.

466
00:19:28,224 --> 00:19:30,910
So just know that if you've
experimented with this before

467
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:34,464
and you found it a little
bit tricky, you're not alone.

468
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,880
So to that end, the team has
been looking at this problem.

469
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,600
And we recently made public
an early version of a 3D

470
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,220
model viewer web component.

471
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,857
This is really,
really early, but it

472
00:19:43,857 --> 00:19:46,190
does some things today to
make life a little bit easier.

473
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:49,460
And the reason we released it
early was to get your feedback.

474
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,460
To give you some context
for this web component,

475
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,220
there's three things
we're trying to do.

476
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,970
The first is we want
you to be able to add

477
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:58,090
3D models to your site without
having to learn 3D programming

478
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,960
or writing 3D code.

479
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,650
The second is we want it to
work well and responsibly

480
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,930
across browsers and across
different device form

481
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,030
factors with
progressive enhancement

482
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,910
to take advantage
of capabilities

483
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,020
on browsers where
they're available.

484
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,990
And then the third
goal is that as new API

485
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,959
ships, such as the
WebXR device API,

486
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:18,250
we want the component to
start taking advantage of them

487
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,624
so that you don't
have to keep up

488
00:20:19,624 --> 00:20:23,710
to date with all of the
changes that are coming out.

489
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,502
So, like I said,
it is super early,

490
00:20:25,502 --> 00:20:26,710
but we've made some progress.

491
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,418
And so I want to give
you a sense of what

492
00:20:28,418 --> 00:20:29,580
the component can do today.

493
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,954
Let's run through
a few examples.

494
00:20:30,954 --> 00:20:33,460
And this is the first one,
the simplest use case,

495
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,910
which is a static GLTF model.

496
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,450
For those who haven't heard GLTF
before, it is a 3D file format,

497
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,270
and it is a required
component of this model viewer

498
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,910
because it's a format that will
allow us to work across all

499
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,507
of the different browsers.

500
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:49,840
Here, you can see that if we
add a couple of attributes,

501
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,670
we can bring the model to life.

502
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,530
In this case, we set
the background color,

503
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,480
and we set it to auto rotate.

504
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,980
With the controls
attribute, we also

505
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,860
can allow the user to spin it
around and move it and take

506
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,660
a look at what's going
on, then look at it

507
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,580
from the back and the front.

508
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,120
We've also added a
poster image capability.

509
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,430
And you could delay the
loading of the model,

510
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,450
so you're not consuming
data on mobile,

511
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,890
if that's what you want to do.

512
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,390
And the attributes
are also dynamic.

513
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,681
So if you add a little script
which switches the poster

514
00:21:16,681 --> 00:21:18,940
image back and forth, you
can animate it a little bit

515
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,700
to give the user a sense that
it's not just another image.

516
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,860
It's actually a 3D model
that they could click on.

517
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,950
It works in that way
similar to an image tag.

518
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,840
The component also handles some
forms of responsive design.

519
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,570
So you can see here that it
will scale up for desktop

520
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,160
and it will scale
down for mobile.

521
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,200
And it will manage the
staging and the lighting

522
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,480
and the rendering of
the model properly.

523
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,510
It can also manage multiple
instances on the same page,

524
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,540
so it will take care of
WebGL from that perspective.

525
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,460
And it uses
IntersectionObserver to make

526
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,390
sure it's not burning battery
and GPU when you can't actually

527
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,890
see the model.

528
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,040
Finally, the team is
experimenting right now

529
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,915
with some of the more
progressive enhancement

530
00:21:57,915 --> 00:21:58,650
capabilities.

531
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,025
In this case, you
can see they're

532
00:22:00,025 --> 00:22:02,940
experimenting with the WebXR
API and incorporating that,

533
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,000
so that you can add more
attributes to turn on AR

534
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,600
and do that across
different devices.

535
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,100
Again, this is really early.

536
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,870
The team is still
working on more features

537
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,450
for user interface and
responsive design features

538
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,950
to make it as easy as possible
to add a 3D model to a web

539
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:19,750
page.

540
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,125
Looking forward,
there's a lot we

541
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,290
can do on realism,
augmented reality use cases,

542
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,340
interactivity.

543
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,960
The whole reason
we made this public

544
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,620
is that we'd love
you to try it out,

545
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,010
and we'd like to get your
feedback in the GitHub.

546
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,450
So if this is something
you're interested in,

547
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,330
please do go to the
GitHub, take a look,

548
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:37,690
try it out, and then let
us know what you think.

549
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,160
And with that, we're done.

550
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,550
So we covered today a little
bit about the WebXR device API.

551
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,110
We talked about three.js.

552
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:48,740
And we touched briefly on this
new early release of the model

553
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,044
viewer web component.

554
00:22:50,044 --> 00:22:51,460
If you're interested
in more, this

555
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,230
is the slide to
take a picture of.

556
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,760
The links are all on the screen.

557
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,220
If you're watching this
at home, you can rewind,

558
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,440
and you can check it out on
YouTube later, I imagine,

559
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,770
as well.

560
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,600
And with that,
thank you very much.

561
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,000
We thank you for your time.

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,650
