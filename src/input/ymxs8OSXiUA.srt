00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:07,142


3
00:00:07,142 --> 00:00:09,600
ELIZABETH SWEENY: Well, we are
excited because nobody likes

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,940
to wait, and we want to
talk to you about all

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,670
of the optimizations
and measurement tools

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,000
that we have been working
on and can provide to you.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,530
And we're going to
start with going over

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,110
an overview of user metrics,
kind of what we care about

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,450
and why, then looking at
the latest developments

10
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,690
in Lighthouse, the Chrome
UX Report, or CrUX,

11
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,729
and talk about how
we're unifying tooling

12
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,290
across the board.

13
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,910
PAUL IRISH: All right, so when
it comes to web performance,

14
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,720
one thing you could
say is you can't

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,740
improve what you don't measure.

16
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,740
ELIZABETH SWEENY: This
was Peter Drucker, right?

17
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,844
He was a management guy?

18
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:46,260
PAUL IRISH: This
is actually true.

19
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,750
Peter Drucker-- really,
really well known kind

20
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,722
of business management guru.

21
00:00:52,722 --> 00:00:54,180
To be honest, I
think he might have

22
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,520
been a front-end
developer, as well,

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,810
but this is just
absolutely true.

24
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:02,670
If you want to make something
better, step one is measure it.

25
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,840
And let's get into that
with web performance.

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,910
To measure, we need to
look at some metrics.

27
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,920
And it's really
important to make sure

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,621
that your metrics are user
centric and really focused

29
00:01:14,621 --> 00:01:15,120
on the user.

30
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,110
We heard a little bit ago about
pending wait time and some

31
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,880
of those custom
metrics, but we'd

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,530
like to have metrics
that really focus

33
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,037
on how the user experience is.

34
00:01:25,037 --> 00:01:27,120
So let's take a page load,
break it down, and look

35
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,340
at a few key metrics in here.

36
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,530
So a little film strip here.

37
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,610
We're loading a
search result page.

38
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,510
And so we just have a little
progression of a few images,

39
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,380
getting to our final result or
where the page is done loading.

40
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,710
Now, underneath the things
that we see visually

41
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,230
is a few things happening.

42
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:49,150
There's the main thread
and network requests,

43
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,650
and these are really
important, too,

44
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,490
because it actually weighs
in a lot on the actual user

45
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,231
experience.

46
00:01:54,231 --> 00:01:56,730
So I want to point a few things
out here, the first of which

47
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,175
is this point right here.

48
00:01:58,175 --> 00:02:00,930
This is the first time that
text shows up on the page.

49
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,490
It's first time the
content is there.

50
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,660
So we call this, the
duration from the navigation

51
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,360
to the point at which text shows
up, the first contentful paint.

52
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,540
Easy enough-- I think
we know this one.

53
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,060
A little bit later
though, you can

54
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,780
see right after the main thread
kind of quiets down a bit,

55
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,900
this right here is
important moment.

56
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,910
All the long tasks in the
main thread have done,

57
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,960
so the main thread has kind
of quieted down and allowed

58
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,810
the page to now be
responsive to users

59
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,850
once they choose to
interact with it.

60
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,680
Also, the network
is quiet, so we

61
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,750
know there's no one big
massive script hanging out

62
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,910
ready to run and take up
time in the main thread.

63
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,520
So the duration from
navigation to this point,

64
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,700
we call this time
to interactive.

65
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,450
All right, and there's
one more key metric

66
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,950
I want to cover real quick.

67
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,710
Now, in this page load,
a user could really

68
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,840
touch the screen at any point.

69
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,090
They could interact with
it here once there's

70
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,750
a paint on screen or
a little bit later,

71
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,540
but let's just say for
the purposes of this,

72
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,600
they tap the screen
at this point.

73
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,640
Now, the thing is, if they
tap the screen at this point,

74
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,920
take a look at what's
happening on the main thread--

75
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,620
a lot of things.

76
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,960
We're in the middle
of a big long task.

77
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,710
And that means the
page is not going to be

78
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:22,090
able to respond to the user.

79
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,960
So we have to wait a little
bit until the page can actually

80
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,950
respond.

81
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,980
So this duration, the
time from the input

82
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,870
until the end of the long
task that we're dealing with,

83
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,774
we call this the
first input delay.

84
00:03:34,774 --> 00:03:36,190
This is an important
metric, and I

85
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,880
want to spend a little
bit more time on it.

86
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,330
If this is a main
thread, well, it's

87
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,400
a very open and
available main thread.

88
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,150
Really, nothing happening.

89
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,670
So let's say if the user
had some input, well, piece

90
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,370
of cake, we can just
reply to it immediately.

91
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,070
Your event handler is going to
run, touch, start, or click,

92
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,736
or you're going to
do style, and layout,

93
00:03:57,736 --> 00:03:59,250
and paint, and ship a frame.

94
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,541
They're going to see something.

95
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,610
So if, let's say, they're
tapping on the Menu icon

96
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,790
and then the menu slides
out, so we're good.

97
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,730
But if there is one task
sitting on the main thread,

98
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,740
well, we're just
going to have to wait.

99
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,279
So we always, yes, we'll be
doing the event handling,

100
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,820
but this time between when
the inputs's first received

101
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,140
and when the events
will be dispatched,

102
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,910
that is the input delay.

103
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,240
First input delay is just
the first input of the page.

104
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,490
It's just the first time
that a user touches the page.

105
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,520
And the important thing here
is that first input delay

106
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,000
is a field metric.

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,300
It really only makes sense
to gather in the field.

108
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,410
Time to interactive is a great
and really powerful metric,

109
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,230
but it makes sense mostly in
the lab, in a lab scenario.

110
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,470
And we've recognized this, that
basically time to interactive

111
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,470
out in the field where real
users are tapping on the screen

112
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,350
as the page is loading,
it really kind of messes

113
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,550
with this metric.

114
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,400
So there's a few
metrics on the screen

115
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,580
here basically just
outlining which

116
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,806
makes sense to
gather in the lab,

117
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:09,930
and then some that are only
exclusive in the field.

118
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:14,670
So I want to point out TTI and
First Input Delay or FID are

119
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,140
our interactivity metrics--

120
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,730
really key for understanding
how available the main thread is

121
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,140
to the user.

122
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,450
ELIZABETH SWEENY: OK,
so all of these metrics

123
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,460
are awesome, obviously,
but where can

124
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,630
we actually find them?

125
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,040
So all three of
these metrics are

126
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,350
readily available in their
respective lab and field

127
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,340
environments.

128
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,710
So as Paul was
saying, because FCP

129
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,260
can be measured in both
the lab and in the field

130
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,610
with real users, it's
available across the board.

131
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,210
So that's in Lighthouse, in
the Chrome User Experience

132
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:46,060
Report or CrUX, and
there's a web perf API.

133
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,150
TTI is only
available in the lab,

134
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,910
and so can only be accessed
via Lighthouse and Page Speed

135
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,260
Insights.

136
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,250
Now, FID requires real
user input to measure,

137
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,270
so it's available in CrUX.

138
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,490
And FID is exciting
because it's actually

139
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,820
going to be coming to
Chrome in Q4 or early Q1

140
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,260
as a web perf API.

141
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,821
So it should be
able to give you a--

142
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:09,570
you can view it in a
Performance Observer,

143
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,852
just as you get FCP today,
which is kind of cool.

144
00:06:11,852 --> 00:06:12,810
PAUL IRISH: Super cool.

145
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:13,120
ELIZABETH SWEENY: Yeah.

146
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,840
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, excited about
standardization of this stuff.

147
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,612
It's really exciting.

148
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:19,320
ELIZABETH SWEENY: So
for those of you who

149
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,320
aren't familiar with Lighthouse,
and we know that it's awesome

150
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,300
and a lot of people
know, but Lighthouse

151
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,910
is an open source automated
tool for improving

152
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,320
the quality of web pages.

153
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,910
So you can run it
against any web page,

154
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,900
and that's either public or
requiring authentication,

155
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,730
and it has audits for
performance, accessibility,

156
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,422
PWA, and more.

157
00:06:39,422 --> 00:06:41,130
I'm excited to tell
you about some things

158
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,713
that we've been doing
with Lighthouse.

159
00:06:42,713 --> 00:06:46,110
So one of those things
is a PWA refactor.

160
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,510
So currently, there
is a broad spectrum

161
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,570
of PWA definitions
in the wild that

162
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,420
can make it difficult to
identify whether or not,

163
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,970
definitively, you are a PWA.

164
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,730
And while our PWA checklist
is absolutely wonderful,

165
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:03,840
and it gives you no helpful
guidance towards what a PWA is,

166
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,830
we want a machine verifiable
way to say yes or no.

167
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,770
So today, we're launching
the new Lighthouse UI

168
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:16,260
with a more binary badging
system for the PWA category.

169
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,010
And the badge groupings
reflect that we want everybody

170
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,260
to be able to achieve the
fast and reliable badge.

171
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,570
All experiences should
be that whether or not

172
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,890
you're installable or not.

173
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:30,180
In order to actually become a
full PWA and get that badge,

174
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,262
you have to successfully fulfill
all audits in the categories.

175
00:07:35,262 --> 00:07:35,970
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

176
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,106
There's a few more things
that we've been doing.

177
00:07:38,106 --> 00:07:43,200
And in the new 4.0,
4.0 alpha that's

178
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,239
coming out in Lighthouse,
there's a few nice changes

179
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:46,780
that we made.

180
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,970
So one of the things that
we've been working on

181
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,553
is reducing the
amount of time that it

182
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:51,320
takes to run Lighthouse.

183
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,550
Nobody wants to sit around
waiting for a long time.

184
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,710
So we're happy to report
that the median runtime

185
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,740
of all Lighthouse runs that
we're aware of has dropped down

186
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,170
about 50%, and up
the 90th percentile,

187
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,294
we've also dropped
this down about 66%.

188
00:08:03,294 --> 00:08:04,710
So we're really
jazzed about this.

189
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,510
We want to make
sure that it's not

190
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:10,910
a long wait for you to get the
insights that are available.

191
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,200
A few more changes--

192
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,100
we've changed how scores
are kind of represented.

193
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,800
So if you've seen kind of at
the top of a Lighthouse report

194
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,130
these score gauges,
right beneath them

195
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,230
is this little scale, right?

196
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:29,040
So this is just how the numeric
scale is mapped to a color.

197
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,444
We made a change here.

198
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:31,860
And I just want
to point out, none

199
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,010
of the numerical scores
and those calculations

200
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,600
have changed in this new update.

201
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,840
It's just deciding
which color is applied.

202
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,620
So this is basically the change.

203
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,660
We've just adjusted how the
various numerical scores

204
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,610
map to these colors.

205
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,790
ELIZABETH SWEENY: Yeah,
so basically, we're

206
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,040
raising the bar about
what our expectations are

207
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,019
for a performance site.

208
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:56,310
But if you're in the green,
you should feel really good

209
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,310
about it.

210
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,860
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, it's good.

211
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,670
I know a lot of--

212
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,820
yeah, it's nice
to go for the 100.

213
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,770
I love the 100.

214
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,050
I'm excited about it.

215
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,834
But, yeah, if you're in
the green, you're good,

216
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:10,250
so I just want to
make that clear.

217
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,400
All right, sweet.

218
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,272
Now, there's a few more changes,
and this one about throttling--

219
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:19,560
when it comes the throttling,
a good mobile-throttling preset

220
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,880
shouldn't necessarily map
to the particular conditions

221
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,620
of a telecommunications
system and its specification.

222
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,770
A good preset maps to
what real users feel.

223
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,390
And so really,
what we want to do

224
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,910
is we want to capture the
latency and throughput

225
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,090
at the 80th percentile,
the frustrating experiences

226
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:43,160
that you oftentimes experience.

227
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,600
And we want to keep pace
with this measurement

228
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,650
as our global telecommunications
infrastructure gets upgraded.

229
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,320
A lot of people are
moving from 3G to 4G,

230
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,980
and we want to make sure
that we capture that.

231
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,910
And so we're making a change,
but actually not in the latency

232
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,120
and throughput numbers.

233
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,010
This is actually just
a labeling change.

234
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,810
So wherever you
see fast 3G today,

235
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,120
you'll be seeing slow 4G.

236
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,540
And it's actually because the
preset that we use actually

237
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,630
captures a 4G experience
more than a 3G experience.

238
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,100
So just FYI, same stuff--

239
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,780
different now.

240
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,340
It's all good.

241
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,120
What's next?

242
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,000
Oh, yeah, so there's a
few other things going on

243
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,610
with Lighthouse, really nice
projects making use of it.

244
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,860
First up, check out
some of the projects

245
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,020
on GitHub taking
advantage of Lighthouse,

246
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,427
some of the dependent projects.

247
00:10:38,427 --> 00:10:39,510
Really cool stuff in here.

248
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,210
A lot happening in
the recent months.

249
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:47,070
Many projects building systems
around using Lighthouse

250
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,930
in a continuous
integration experience

251
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,570
so that on every commit,
you run Lighthouse, store

252
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,890
all that data, get graphs--

253
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:56,594
some really cool stuff happening
in here, so take a look.

254
00:10:56,594 --> 00:10:58,260
Lighthouse is also
available in a number

255
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,660
of different commercial
products as well.

256
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,340
First is Calibre--
fantastic stuff here.

257
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,240
Treo is another one.

258
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,460
I think this is my
site, which is doing OK.

259
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,580
Accessibility actually
does need some work,

260
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,040
but there's some nice stuff.

261
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,520
And the last is
SpeedCurve, which

262
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,400
actually just added
support for Lighthouse

263
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,370
just a few months ago.

264
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,280
So we're excited
to see Lighthouse

265
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,667
becoming part of the production
monitoring kind of ecosystem.

266
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:28,500
ELIZABETH SWEENY: And
even internally, we're

267
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,910
excited to see where
Lighthouse is being integrated.

268
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,840
So one of those examples, as
was announced in the keynote,

269
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,300
is the new site web.dev.

270
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,480
And it's exciting
to be integrating it

271
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,540
with really prescriptive,
actionable guidance.

272
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,420
And you can run
Lighthouse with any URL,

273
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,990
and it will provide you with
a prioritized to-do list

274
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,690
with that guidance
and interactive code

275
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:55,140
labs for the specific things
that you need to work on.

276
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,230
What's so exciting about this
is that for the first time,

277
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:02,698
tooling is directly integrated
with the documentation.

278
00:12:02,698 --> 00:12:04,410
PAUL IRISH: Yeah,
that's pretty hot.

279
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,540
ELIZABETH SWEENY: And we
wanted to also call out

280
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,000
another wonderful
partner who has done

281
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,070
a good job of using Lighthouse.

282
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:16,020
So Squarespace was able to use
Lighthouse as an out-of-the-box

283
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,090
auditing and reporting
system to build on top of.

284
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,700
And it allowed them to
improve their 50th percentile

285
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,820
and 95th percentile TTI
by over three times,

286
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,680
so we were super
excited by that.

287
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,200
They used it to generate
traces and dig that deep

288
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,600
into specific problems
as they happened,

289
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,920
as opposed to post progression.

290
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,370
So now, we are going to talk
a little bit about the Chrome

291
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,320
User Experience
Report, or as it says,

292
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,920
CrUX, as I've already
said, I think, three times.

293
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,500
CrUX actually provides
user experience metrics

294
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,030
for how real world Chrome users
experience popular destinations

295
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,880
on the web.

296
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,210
So it's a data set that
is powered by real user

297
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:58,890
measurement by key user
metrics across the public web,

298
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:02,842
and it's aggregated anonymously
from users who have opted in.

299
00:13:02,842 --> 00:13:04,800
We're excited to talk
about some of the updates

300
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,487
that we've done here.

301
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:08,070
One of the things,
and it was actually

302
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,350
featured in [? Aanchal's ?] talk
earlier, is regional analysis.

303
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,890
So we heard loud and
clear from developers

304
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,140
that we needed to be
able to break down

305
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,450
this data set in a
country specific way,

306
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,590
and now you can do that.

307
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,800
So via BigQuery, which is
where you can interact and play

308
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,400
with this data set you can
now get separate country

309
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,135
specific data sets
to pull it apart.

310
00:13:29,135 --> 00:13:30,510
PAUL IRISH: And,
yeah, so this is

311
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,260
just-- this is how
you've been interacting

312
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:36,600
with Chrome UX Report in the
past is working with BigQuery.

313
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,440
But I heard that there's like
a nice, new, shiny thing?

314
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,580
ELIZABETH SWEENY: Yeah.

315
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,480
You can get it way easier now.

316
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,150
So the brand new
CrUX dashboard, which

317
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,980
was announced just
a bit ago, it allows

318
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,070
you to understand how an
origin's performance evolves

319
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,340
over time.

320
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,010
And so it's built
on Data Studio.

321
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,440
It's much more
easily accessible,

322
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,740
and it can be easily
customized and shared

323
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,200
with everyone on your team.

324
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,370
And it doesn't require you
to write your own script

325
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,230
on BigQuery to access it.

326
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,480
And it's automatically synced
with all the latest data

327
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,430
sets, so you're good to go.

328
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,730
Also, to ensure consistency
across all of our tooling,

329
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,040
as we've mentioned,
that's a huge goal for us,

330
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:20,160
FID is now launched as an
experimental metric in CrUX.

331
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,550
So when we announced last
year, the data set only

332
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:28,510
had 10,000 origins, and now
we are at over 4 million.

333
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:32,460
And if you are excited
to see your websites--

334
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,500
PAUL IRISH: I am excited to see
paulirish.com in this data set.

335
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:35,780
ELIZABETH SWEENY: Yeah.

336
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,300
PAUL IRISH: Because it's
not, and it would be great.

337
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,050
ELIZABETH SWEENY: Yeah,
we're working hard

338
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,080
to improve it, and
expand quickly,

339
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,570
and so if you're
excited, check in

340
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,570
soon because we are
working hard to move fast.

341
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,490
PAUL IRISH: Awesome.

342
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:50,310
All right, so one of the things
that's really important to us

343
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:56,060
is to have a unified story
between our performance tools.

344
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,740
So, OK, so hand raising time.

345
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,908
Raise your hand if
you've used Lighthouse.

346
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:02,700
All right, yes.

347
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,760
Raise your hand if you've
used Page Speed Insights.

348
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,500
Yes, of course.

349
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,540
Raise your hand
if you've noticed

350
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,910
that what you're seeing
in Lighthouse and Page

351
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,380
Speed Insights
doesn't necessarily

352
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,930
be telling the same story.

353
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,100
Yeah, I'm there with you too.

354
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,970
Now, we saw this was
a bit of an issue,

355
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:25,620
and we wanted to improve it
because we don't want advice

356
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,810
from two different tools
that Google provides

357
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,100
that is kind of conflicting.

358
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,310
So we've been working
hard and collaborating

359
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,870
with the Search team on this.

360
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,500
And so today, we're
excited to announce

361
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,080
that there's a brand new
next generation of Page Speed

362
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,224
Insights now powered
by Lighthouse.

363
00:15:44,224 --> 00:15:45,640
And this is really
exciting stuff.

364
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,834
So now, if you use
Page Speed Insights,

365
00:15:47,834 --> 00:15:50,250
all of the data that you've
been seeing in Lighthouse when

366
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,400
it comes to performance
is now in the report.

367
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,490
All of the metrics, and
[? op trees, ?] and diagnostics

368
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,840
all right there.

369
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,170
You also see the top
score that you have been

370
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,550
seeing in Page Speed Insights.

371
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,770
That score is the Lighthouse
performance category score,

372
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,740
so kind of speaking
the same language.

373
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,060
And still, if you've really
enjoyed kind of the Chrome UX

374
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,990
Report data that has
been available inside

375
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,330
of Page Speed Insights,
that's there too.

376
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:21,580
I'm going to play a quick little
screencast of how this looks.

377
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,310
So let's take a
look at Chrome.com

378
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,170
in Page Speed Insights.

379
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,840
We're going.

380
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,060
Come on.

381
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:30,990
Yeah.

382
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,700
Great, good, awesome.

383
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,610
This is in real time.

384
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,550
I did not speed
anything up, so we've

385
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,560
got to wait for the latency.

386
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,019
So, yeah, so here's--

387
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:40,560
this should look
very fairly familiar

388
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,510
if you've used Lighthouse.

389
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,850
But up at the top,
we have field data.

390
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,770
And by default,
paid speed on sites

391
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:51,840
runs both analysis on mobile
and desktop at the same time,

392
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,620
delivers you the
results simultaneously.

393
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,830
So you can check that out.

394
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:00,130
So this is live today,
so go check it out.

395
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:00,990
Take a look.

396
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:04,927
Give us your feedback I'm
excited to have this out there.

397
00:17:04,927 --> 00:17:05,510
AUDIENCE: Woo!

398
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,579
PAUL IRISH: All right, thanks.

399
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:08,250
Oh, yeah, I mean, you
can clap if you want.

400
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,083
I mean, that's cool.

401
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,310
[APPLAUSE]

402
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,569


403
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:17,500
All right, and if you've
ever actually opened up--

404
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,204
I don't know.

405
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,700
I have a tendency of opening
up the dev tools on basically

406
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,129
every site that I do.

407
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:25,630
You know, it's just a habit.

408
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:28,719
So I opened up the dev tools
on Page Speed Insights, and lo

409
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:31,780
and behold, it's just
a thin web app that

410
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,585
makes a call to an
API, a RESTful API,

411
00:17:34,585 --> 00:17:38,650
and it's actually the
Page Speed Insights API.

412
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:42,670
So we were like, well,
this kind of means

413
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,170
that in order to
do this, then we're

414
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,836
going to have to have
all the Lighthouse

415
00:17:45,836 --> 00:17:48,192
data available over the API.

416
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,150
So that's what we have.

417
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:53,770
The new Page Speed API V5, we
consider it the Lighthouse API

418
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,150
V1.

419
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:58,660
All the same Lighthouse data,
including all categories, not

420
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,940
just performance,
but all of them.

421
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,315
And all the work
is done for you.

422
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:06,260
No waiting for your own Chrome
to reload and do the analysis.

423
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,660
So we'll do the work for you.

424
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:16,300
And the Chrome UX Report data,
that summary is still in--

425
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,250
it's added into the response.

426
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,950
That's the word.

427
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,800
Basic usage-- I don't know if
you'd use it from fetch client

428
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,760
side, but if you did, it would
look something like this.

429
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,870
Well, just pass the URL.

430
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,870
There's a few other
parameters customize things.

431
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,730
Get back the result.
Looks a little like this.

432
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:36,670
There's a Lighthouse result full
of the exact same Lighthouse

433
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:40,510
data that you'd be getting
by running Lighthouse

434
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,640
anywhere else.

435
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,020
And inside that loading
experience property,

436
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,630
that is the Chrome
UX Report stuff.

437
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,270
So really cool, check it out.

438
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:54,820
Details and documentations,
reference guides here--

439
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,180
Page Speed Insights V5.

440
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:58,705
All right.

441
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:00,580
ELIZABETH SWEENY: And
so this is really cool.

442
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,090
PAUL IRISH: It's really cool.

443
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,520
ELIZABETH SWEENY: Yeah, it
means all unified analysis,

444
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,300
and it's the same.

445
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,280
So when you're measuring,
you're optimizing.

446
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,660
You're monitoring.

447
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,570
If you want to start making
changes and testing things out,

448
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,560
there's a place for
you to go for that.

449
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,970
So that's great, and we have
all of these things aligned,

450
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,942
but where do you go for what?

451
00:19:17,942 --> 00:19:19,150
And when should you go there?

452
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:24,940


453
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,070
If you need a snapshot
of a page's performance,

454
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,350
as Paul said earlier,
Page Speed Insights

455
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,960
is a good default to go
to because it provides you

456
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,530
with both the field and the lab
and gives you a good benchmark.

457
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:38,200
If you want to make
changes, test, and iterate,

458
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,390
and really have
that fast feedback,

459
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,820
then the Chrome extension,
the audits panel,

460
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,220
or operating within the
command line interface

461
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,750
is going to be a
good place to go.

462
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,340
And finally, if you want to set
up production monitoring or set

463
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,590
budgets, then the API is
going to be fantastic.

464
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:57,070
But across the entire
development lifecycle,

465
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,860
you now are completely
powered by Lighthouse, which

466
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,940
we're super excited about.

467
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,370
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

468
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,550
So to wrap up, well,
I guess if there's

469
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:10,150
one thing or four things that
you take away from this--

470
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,780
first up, measure
well, measure often.

471
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,610
You can't approve what
you don't measure.

472
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:18,140
ELIZABETH SWEENY: Yep.

473
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,210
You can now use the
Page Speed Insights

474
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,990
for quick Lighthouse analysis.

475
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,810
PAUL IRISH: The CrUX
real world data really

476
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:30,410
helps round out
your view of what's

477
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:33,170
happening with your users
and really understand

478
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,780
different percentiles
where users are

479
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,940
feeling pain and frustration.

480
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,280
ELIZABETH SWEENY: And finally,
to evaluate performance

481
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,585
at every stage, which is
really important to us,

482
00:20:43,585 --> 00:20:47,260
you can now check out
the API, so go use it.

483
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,990
PAUL IRISH: All right,
I think that's it.

484
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:49,760
Thank you guys very much.

485
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,926
ELIZABETH SWEENY: Thank you.

486
00:20:50,926 --> 00:20:53,110
[MUSIC PLAYING]

487
00:20:53,110 --> 00:21:00,703
