<section><span data-start="7020"><span class="speaker">Dan Dascalescu</span>: I'm here with Stephen Barber</span> <span data-start="9120">who's an engineer on Chrome OS.</span> <span data-start="10507">So good evening, everyone.</span> <span data-start="11590">I'm Dan Dascalescu.</span> <span data-start="12980">I'm a developer advocate at Google,</span> <span data-start="15190">and tonight, we'd like to talk to you about why</span> <span data-start="17490">Chrome OS is an awesome choice as a web developer platform.</span> <span data-start="21870">And there are two main reasons for why you</span> <span data-start="24240">should develop on Chrome OS.</span> <span data-start="26010">The first is that Chrome OS is an unprecedented convergence</span> <span data-start="29790">of technology stacks.</span> <span data-start="31290">It brings together web applications</span> <span data-start="33120">because it's an OS that has a browser as its UI,</span> <span data-start="36690">but it can also run Android apps,</span> <span data-start="38924">and with full Google Play support,</span> <span data-start="40340">you can install Android browsers that you</span> <span data-start="42048">can test your web apps on.</span> <span data-start="43970">And starting with Chrome 69, you can install Linux</span> <span data-start="47040">and you can run your familiar development to a workflow</span> <span data-start="49500">there.</span> <span data-start="51720">And this is a sneak preview of what's coming in the talk.</span> <span data-start="54660">You can see here a terminal, an ID, a couple of browsers,</span> <span data-start="57840">and, of course, a PWA.</span> <span data-start="61260">So the second reason why you should develop on Chrome OS</span> <span data-start="64019">and target Chrome OS is that it powers</span> <span data-start="66150">a very wide variety of devices.</span> <span data-start="68500">You might have seen Chrome OS laptops or Chromebooks</span> <span data-start="71670">from a variety of manufacturers, and also, you</span> <span data-start="74790">might have seen some convertibles, again,</span> <span data-start="77130">from various manufacturers, and those all-in-ones,</span> <span data-start="80640">like the LG Chromebase.</span> <span data-start="82650">And the small form factor PCs — </span> <span data-start="85710">this is the Chromebox, which was built by Samsung — </span> <span data-start="89730">2012.</span> <span data-start="90480">And then HP, Asus, and other manufacturers followed suit.</span> <span data-start="94500">And this is the mini form factor PC.</span> <span data-start="98670">It weighs 3 ounces.</span> <span data-start="99810">You plug it into the HDMI port of a display,</span> <span data-start="102637">and it turns that one into a computer.</span> <span data-start="104220">You can attach a mouse or a keyboard via USB or Bluetooth.</span> <span data-start="109200">And then there are mega displays.</span> <span data-start="111576">This is the Chromebox Commercial.</span> <span data-start="112950">It powers digital signage or kiosk displays.</span> <span data-start="116610">And this summer, we saw the first tablet</span> <span data-start="118530">powered by Chrome OS.</span> <span data-start="120270">This is the Acer Chrome Tab 10.</span> <span data-start="122400">And of course, Google has our own lineage of devices.</span> <span data-start="125968">This is the Pixelbook, the flagship device, which</span> <span data-start="128009">is at 75% off for you guys.</span> <span data-start="133210">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="134970">And our latest offering, the Pixel Slate,</span> <span data-start="137790">which was announced last month.</span> <span data-start="141250">So in one slide, why target Chrome OS?</span> <span data-start="143450">Because of a large and increasing market share,</span> <span data-start="145890">you probably heard that we have a very extensive presence</span> <span data-start="150120">in the EDU space.</span> <span data-start="151050">Chromebooks are very popular there.</span> <span data-start="153510">Then if you optimize for Chrome OS,</span> <span data-start="155070">you'll actually target a variety of these convertible form</span> <span data-start="158340">factors —  devices that have or have not</span> <span data-start="161910">got a keyboard or a mouse or a stylus or even a touch screen.</span> <span data-start="166180">So this could also future proof you from devices</span> <span data-start="169920">that haven't been invented yet.</span> <span data-start="172060">Though after I put this slide together,</span> <span data-start="174090">Samsung actually released a foldable screen phone</span> <span data-start="177720">that becomes a tablet.</span> <span data-start="179310">So the future is here already.</span> <span data-start="183610">So again, in one slide, the reason is diversity.</span> <span data-start="186660">You can develop apps on Linux and test them</span> <span data-start="188940">on a variety of Android and Linux browsers.</span> <span data-start="192630">So Chrome OS brings together your own development</span> <span data-start="194724">workflow —  the one you're familiar</span> <span data-start="196140">with —  your own development tools,</span> <span data-start="198340">a variety of form factors, from mobile to tablet</span> <span data-start="200700">to convertible to desktop, and browsers on Android and Linux.</span> <span data-start="207160">And there are quite a few of them — </span> <span data-start="208950">Edge and Samsung Internet work on the Pixel Slate.</span> <span data-start="212340">The others should be able to be installed on Google Pixel,</span> <span data-start="215190">as well.</span> <span data-start="216780">And this is Edge and UC browser and Firefox running</span> <span data-start="221920">on the same Chrome OS machine.</span> <span data-start="224130">Then you can install some desktop browsers,</span> <span data-start="227380">so you can test, in full desktop, Firefox,</span> <span data-start="229680">if you install the Linux version of it.</span> <span data-start="233080">This is Firefox and this is Epiphany, a.k.a.</span> <span data-start="235910">GNOME Web.</span> <span data-start="237240">And you can also install Docker, which, I've heard, many of you</span> <span data-start="241370">are interested during the forum.</span> <span data-start="243820">This is unofficial support for it,</span> <span data-start="245380">but there is a thread on Reddit if you</span> <span data-start="247680">search for Docker now working in the [INAUDIBLE] sub-reddit.</span> <span data-start="253450">You'll find this thread.</span> <span data-start="255710">Try at your own risk, but it does work.</span> <span data-start="258700">So how does it work?</span> <span data-start="259709">How does Chrome OS manage to stick</span> <span data-start="262050">to its principles, which are speed, simplicity,</span> <span data-start="265710">and security?</span> <span data-start="266950">How can it run all these different web apps</span> <span data-start="269280">and Android apps from Play and Linux apps like GIMP</span> <span data-start="273420">while staying fast, simple, and secure?</span> <span data-start="276600">This boils down to the containers architecture,</span> <span data-start="279330">which I'll let Steve tell you more about.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="282456"><span class="speaker">Stephen Barber</span>: Thanks, Dan.</span> <span data-start="284040">So when we were bringing Linux apps to Chrome OS,</span> <span data-start="287480">it was really important that we maintain all of the things that</span> <span data-start="290760">make Chrome OS Chrome OS.</span> <span data-start="293250">So simplicity was first.</span> <span data-start="295290">It shouldn't feel like you're running a separate OS,</span> <span data-start="298050">but instead, have the Linux terminal and GUI app</span> <span data-start="301280">seamlessly blend in with Chrome and Android apps.</span> <span data-start="304870">And we've managed to do this while keeping things fast.</span> <span data-start="308260">So Android and Linux support don't do any emulation.</span> <span data-start="312600">By using lightweight containers and hardware virtualization</span> <span data-start="315240">support, your code will run natively.</span> <span data-start="318540">And of course, security is always</span> <span data-start="319980">on the mind for Chrome OS.</span> <span data-start="321480">So Crostini uses both virtualization and containers</span> <span data-start="324660">to provide security in depth.</span> <span data-start="329870">So to expand a bit on security, we're</span> <span data-start="331910">starting from a secure foundation</span> <span data-start="334070">and we're working our way up with features from there.</span> <span data-start="336900">So right now, Linux is pretty isolated</span> <span data-start="339050">from the rest of Chrome OS, but we're working on the ability</span> <span data-start="341690">to share files and folders with it,</span> <span data-start="345080">and soon, we'll be adding support for Google Drive,</span> <span data-start="347720">as well.</span> <span data-start="348334">So you'll be able to keep all of your dot files, projects,</span> <span data-start="350750">and other important work safe in the cloud.</span> <span data-start="355350">So let's take a look under the hood real quick.</span> <span data-start="357759">The first time you launch a Linux app after logging in,</span> <span data-start="360050">it will start up a lightweight VM and container.</span> <span data-start="363390">So this VM is actually providing the outer security boundary</span> <span data-start="367100">and gives you a real Linux kernel.</span> <span data-start="369930">And it's actually a minimal version</span> <span data-start="372270">of Chrome OS that was designed specifically to run containers.</span> <span data-start="376610">And the container inside is where you do all of your work.</span> <span data-start="380310">This container is very tightly integrated</span> <span data-start="382035">with the rest of Chrome OS.</span> <span data-start="383160">So things like launcher icons and graphical apps</span> <span data-start="386190">work just like any other Chrome OS or Android app.</span> <span data-start="389514">And the most important thing, of course,</span> <span data-start="391180">is that you get a terminal.</span> <span data-start="394925">So how does it actually feel?</span> <span data-start="397330">What's it like?</span> <span data-start="398430">And the answer should be, like most other Linux systems.</span> <span data-start="402760">So Crostini is based right now on Debian stable</span> <span data-start="406570">because a lot of developers are familiar with apped package</span> <span data-start="409630">management and Debian-based systems.</span> <span data-start="413950">And for now, we're starting out targeting web developers</span> <span data-start="418630">because Chrome OS is a web-based OS,</span> <span data-start="421330">and we think it's appropriate that you</span> <span data-start="423220">should be able to develop web apps on a web-based OS.</span> <span data-start="428230">So to do this, we provide some nice integration features.</span> <span data-start="431080">Right now, we'll do port forwarding.</span> <span data-start="433060">It doesn't seem like you're running a container.</span> <span data-start="436030">You get local hosts to connect to,</span> <span data-start="439190">and that's treated as a secure origin, just like it should be.</span> <span data-start="443431">But if you do want to treat your container</span> <span data-start="445180">like a separate system, you can.</span> <span data-start="446680">And we provide a penguin.linux.test DNS alias.</span> <span data-start="452240">And we do want to support more developer</span> <span data-start="454160">workflows than just the web.</span> <span data-start="455940">So we will be adding USB, GPU, audio support,</span> <span data-start="459650">file systems and user space, and better file</span> <span data-start="462380">sharing in upcoming releases.</span> <span data-start="464630">And now, Dan will talk a bit more about using Chromebooks</span> <span data-start="467180">for web development and show us what</span> <span data-start="468679">Crostini looks like in action.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="470005"><span class="speaker">Dan Dascalescu</span>: Thank you, Steve.</span> <span data-start="474470">So we know how it works.</span> <span data-start="476249">We know why it's awesome.</span> <span data-start="477290">Let's see how to actually use it for developing web apps.</span> <span data-start="482390">The goal is to let developers do everything they need locally,</span> <span data-start="486050">and the Crostini support is still in development,</span> <span data-start="488150">but most things work as expected.</span> <span data-start="491120">You can run editors, IDs, databases like Mongo or MySQL,</span> <span data-start="494750">local servers, and pretty much anything</span> <span data-start="497270">you can install with apt.</span> <span data-start="500270">To setup Crostini, search for Linux in Settings,</span> <span data-start="504050">and then you'll see this dialogue.</span> <span data-start="505670">Once you tap Install, in about a minute or two,</span> <span data-start="508156">depending on your network speed, you'll</span> <span data-start="509780">have Linux installed on your Chromebook.</span> <span data-start="512840">And this is a terminal.</span> <span data-start="514679">So we have a terminal.</span> <span data-start="515620">Woo-hoo.</span> <span data-start="516120">Let's build a desktop web app for Pixelbooks, right?</span> <span data-start="519919">A bit about how these apps are usually built.</span> <span data-start="522980">A lot of development of desktop dev apps</span> <span data-start="524690">is done with Electron or Node-Webkit.</span> <span data-start="526970">But the problem with that is Electron</span> <span data-start="528920">means Chromium plus Node.</span> <span data-start="530490">So you ship a rendering stack along with your app.</span> <span data-start="533180">And that might be useful if you have needs for low level</span> <span data-start="537710">access, but consider Carlo, which</span> <span data-start="539540">is a Google project that is essentially a helpful Node app</span> <span data-start="543740">framework.</span> <span data-start="544615">It provides applications with Chrome rendering capabilities.</span> <span data-start="548750">So with Carlo, you don't have to ship Chromium or any rendering</span> <span data-start="551745">engine with your app.</span> <span data-start="552620">It uses a locally detected instance of Chrome</span> <span data-start="555470">and it connects to your process pipe,</span> <span data-start="557570">and then exposes the high level API for you</span> <span data-start="559520">to render in Chrome from your Node script.</span> <span data-start="564140">But if you don't need all these low level OS features,</span> <span data-start="567170">you can do something even simpler,</span> <span data-start="568650">which is to build a progressive web app.</span> <span data-start="572090">This is what Spotify has done.</span> <span data-start="573990">You can see here that I'm going to open the Spotify</span> <span data-start="577340">[INAUDIBLE] tab and click that Install App button.</span> <span data-start="580380">And once I accept the install prompt,</span> <span data-start="582470">the tab becomes a PWA without a URL bar,</span> <span data-start="585940">and it has its own buttons, like Close.</span> <span data-start="588620">And you can find it in the shelf.</span> <span data-start="591140">You can launch it from there.</span> <span data-start="593400">And once you launch it, there is no more Install App button</span> <span data-start="596180">because it's an installed progressive web app.</span> <span data-start="598900">And it's also accessible from the shelf.</span> <span data-start="601940">So these system level integration features</span> <span data-start="604130">are provided by Chrome, and they are</span> <span data-start="606920">available on Chrome OS since Chrome 67,</span> <span data-start="609770">which is ancient by now.</span> <span data-start="611600">And on Linux, on Windows, starting with Chrome 70,</span> <span data-start="614300">the current version stable.</span> <span data-start="615710">And on Mac with Chrome 72, or if you</span> <span data-start="617873">want to give it a sneak peak, check the Enable Desktop PWAs</span> <span data-start="621770">flag.</span> <span data-start="624320">This is thanks to service worker support,</span> <span data-start="626540">which has been implemented by all major browsers,</span> <span data-start="629330">and they are also working on advanced features,</span> <span data-start="631910">such as [INAUDIBLE] request.</span> <span data-start="634220">Firefox is working on that.</span> <span data-start="635920">It has special [INAUDIBLE] and at the home screen now.</span> <span data-start="638930">And Safari is also working on authentication APIs.</span> <span data-start="645420">So OK.</span> <span data-start="646140">We've talked a lot.</span> <span data-start="646950">Let's try and do a demo and see if anything blows up.</span> <span data-start="651027">So I've set up Crostini already because that</span> <span data-start="652860">will take two minutes, which I don't want to waste.</span> <span data-start="654985">We're going to install Node, which I have already — </span> <span data-start="657930">VS Code NPM.</span> <span data-start="659376">And then we'll check our Squoosh.</span> <span data-start="660750">You might have seen it in one of the earlier talks.</span> <span data-start="663030">It's an image compression app.</span> <span data-start="664915">We'll open that in VS Code to check out</span> <span data-start="666540">the code around the web server, and the most interesting part</span> <span data-start="669570">is we're going to open Squoosh from an Android browser</span> <span data-start="672000">on the very same device.</span> <span data-start="674520">And if things work, we're also going</span> <span data-start="676690">to do some remote debugging.</span> <span data-start="679460">So these are the instructions to install Node.</span> <span data-start="681980">I've already run them because it takes a bit.</span> <span data-start="684800">And I've switched to the demonstration.</span> <span data-start="689540">I'm going to run the NPM install.</span> <span data-start="691400">NPM build does take awhile.</span> <span data-start="692920">Then, NPM start to start the web server for the Squoosh app.</span> <span data-start="697420">And you see that it tells you it runs at 8080.</span> <span data-start="699890">It bounds to all local addresses.</span> <span data-start="703350">So let's run Chromium for Linux.</span> <span data-start="706640">This runs in the Linux container.</span> <span data-start="709820">And once Squoosh has started, which seems to be the case,</span> <span data-start="712850">let's go to a local host 8080.</span> <span data-start="715880">And there is Squoosh.</span> <span data-start="718030">I'm not sure why it said failed.</span> <span data-start="720620">But it certainly works.</span> <span data-start="722240">You can open images or not.</span> <span data-start="725549">This is a live demo, after all.</span> <span data-start="726840">[LAUGHTER]</span> <span data-start="732760">The point here is that you have access</span> <span data-start="735070">to a local host from the Linux container,</span> <span data-start="737770">and now, let's try running Chrome Dev from Play.</span> <span data-start="743645">And then choosing Chrome Dev here</span> <span data-start="745020">to be able to distinguish the icons.</span> <span data-start="748760">It looks like we need to update it.</span> <span data-start="750379">Hopefully, the update won't break anything.</span> <span data-start="752170">[LAUGHTER]</span> <span data-start="757330">So I'm going to launch it before it gets a chance to update.</span> <span data-start="760361">Now — </span> <span data-start="760860">[LAUGHTER]</span> <span data-start="765600">Local host here will not work.</span> <span data-start="767940">That's a known issue.</span> <span data-start="768990">Steve is working on it.</span> <span data-start="772090">We need to get — </span> <span data-start="773960">didn't mean to put you on the spot, Steve.</span> <span data-start="776580">We need to get the IP address of the Android container, which</span> <span data-start="781020">is this one.</span> <span data-start="782160">There is this command, IP Address Show,</span> <span data-start="784650">which has a long

<section><span data-start="799390"><span class="speaker">Dan Dascalescu</span>: OK.</span> <span data-start="800330">Well, I hope it didn't break anything.</span> <span data-start="805430">Colon.</span> <span data-start="807440">Whoa.</span> <span data-start="808854">[APPLAUSE]</span> <span data-start="814820">So this is Squoosh running in Chrome,</span> <span data-start="816890">and now, let's try something even more dangerous.</span> <span data-start="818960">Let's try to remote debug it with Chromium.</span> <span data-start="823595">On the same machine — </span> <span data-start="824470">I know it's called remote debugging,</span> <span data-start="825620">but it's on the same machine because these</span> <span data-start="827370">are different containers.</span> <span data-start="829230">So to do that, we need to put a device in developer mode,</span> <span data-start="833490">and then enable it to be debugging here,</span> <span data-start="835620">which I've done.</span> <span data-start="836660">And then we need to run this command.</span> <span data-start="839270">That fixed IP is actually documented on our Android setup</span> <span data-start="843320">page.</span> <span data-start="844530">It's the IP of our container, and we set up an ADB bridge</span> <span data-start="848900">to it.</span> <span data-start="849900">So now, if things are on my side,</span> <span data-start="854220">we'll be able to go to Chrome Inspect</span> <span data-start="859340">and see a number of remote targets here.</span> <span data-start="861200">And we actually see two of them, so let's open the Squoosh one,</span> <span data-start="865117">and I'll click Inspect.</span> <span data-start="868860">And this appears to work surprisingly well, for a demo.</span> <span data-start="873512">So I'm going to resize the window</span> <span data-start="875220">and try something really spectacular.</span> <span data-start="877477">I'm going to scroll.</span> <span data-start="881250">So this is live, not an animated GIF.</span> <span data-start="884070">This is actually remote debugging,</span> <span data-start="887310">and whatever I'm doing here, whether this app works or not,</span> <span data-start="891600">you can actually remote debug it with Chromium or Linux,</span> <span data-start="896400">debugging an Android browser running your progressive web</span> <span data-start="900340">app.</span> <span data-start="900840">Does that make sense?</span> <span data-start="906030">This is what I wanted to show, and let's</span> <span data-start="907757">get back to the slides.</span> <span data-start="913507">So these are the instructions for installing Node.</span> <span data-start="915590">There's nothing special here.</span> <span data-start="917090">You follow what Node publishes on their GitHub,</span> <span data-start="920390">then you check out Squoosh using Git.</span> <span data-start="922190">Again, your usual development workflow.</span> <span data-start="925470">And oh, something else.</span> <span data-start="926840">Maybe Steve wants to show this.</span> <span data-start="930050">We can run VS Code to check out the code,</span> <span data-start="933470">so until we switch to the demo, this screenshot</span> <span data-start="936480">shows what we actually are going to do.</span> <span data-start="939050">But great.</span> <span data-start="939880">And I'll do it live now.</span> <span data-start="941090">So Steve is going to double tap that after he copies it</span> <span data-start="944030">to the Linux container.</span> <span data-start="945860">And in the Linux container, if you double tap a dev file,</span> <span data-start="950240">you are prompted to install it as a Linux app.</span> <span data-start="953200">So Chrome OS supports that out of the box,</span> <span data-start="955780">and once the installation completes,</span> <span data-start="958210">you should be able to see visual code in the launcher.</span> <span data-start="962140">And even that installation prompt will say</span> <span data-start="964030">Find Visual Code in the Launcher.</span> <span data-start="966380">And this is not network dependent,</span> <span data-start="968040">so we should be as fast as it was when we rehearsed.</span> <span data-start="974055">Though 58% is not terribly fast.</span> <span data-start="977210">OK, 91.</span> <span data-start="978150">Cool.</span> <span data-start="978765">So show us some code, Steve.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="980857"><span class="speaker">Stephen Barber</span>: All right.</span> <span data-start="981940">Wait one second or two seconds.</span> <span data-start="989910">There it is.</span> <span data-start="990670">Had to search.</span> <span data-start="991780">And here we go.</span> <span data-start="995150">VS Code.</span> <span data-start="996162">[APPLAUSE]</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1003545"><span class="speaker">Dan Dascalescu</span>: Yeah.</span> <span data-start="1004420">I have a manifest.</span> <span data-start="1005170">That's why it's a progressive app —  has a start URL.</span> <span data-start="1008290">OK, so let's switch back to the slides for some best practices</span> <span data-start="1012940">for — </span> <span data-start="1013841">oh, no.</span> <span data-start="1014340">Let's actually look at this once more.</span> <span data-start="1016200">It's really cool, right, how you can drag those in sync, yeah?</span> <span data-start="1022710">I had to brag about that.</span> <span data-start="1023980">So the way to set this up is not trivial,</span> <span data-start="1026369">which is why I posted the Medium post this morning</span> <span data-start="1029750">with complete instructions.</span> <span data-start="1031680">There's about 17 steps you need to follow.</span> <span data-start="1035940">So check out the bit.li/cros-remote-debug</span> <span data-start="1042030">or take a picture of this slide.</span> <span data-start="1044079">OK, I see the phones down, so next.</span> <span data-start="1046859">How to actually optimize PWAs for Chrome OS,</span> <span data-start="1049590">which is not really a topic.</span> <span data-start="1052080">It's more of a non-topic.</span> <span data-start="1053460">You shouldn't detect that you're running on Chrome OS.</span> <span data-start="1056760">You should use Lighthouse as you use for any PWA.</span> <span data-start="1059012">So if you only have five minutes to spend</span> <span data-start="1060720">on optimizing your app, check out</span> <span data-start="1062100">Lighthouse, the auditing tool that will give you</span> <span data-start="1064170">a checklist of what to do.</span> <span data-start="1067260">And make sure that your app installs.</span> <span data-start="1069360">This is one bit that might be different on Chrome OS.</span> <span data-start="1072130">Unlike on older versions of Chrome on mobile,</span> <span data-start="1075060">your users will not be prompted automatically at the bottom</span> <span data-start="1077670">to install the app.</span> <span data-start="1078690">You need to catch the beforeinstallprompt,</span> <span data-start="1080790">and then save that prompt and call the prompt method.</span> <span data-start="1084780">And this is the code to do that, so you add an event listener</span> <span data-start="1087360">for beforeinstallprompt, then you prevent default</span> <span data-start="1090420">for all the browsers, save the prompt</span> <span data-start="1092860">in this deferred variable, and then show your install button.</span> <span data-start="1097170">So here, we just set a display to block.</span> <span data-start="1099960">And then in the click listener for that install button,</span> <span data-start="1102840">you hide it, call the prompt method</span> <span data-start="1105270">from that saved variable, and then</span> <span data-start="1107730">you check the user choice property,</span> <span data-start="1110550">and particularly, the outcome field</span> <span data-start="1112590">to see if the user has accepted your installation.</span> <span data-start="1116580">OK.</span> <span data-start="1117080">So as I said earlier, the answer to this question is no.</span> <span data-start="1121230">You have your app installed on the Chrome OS,</span> <span data-start="1123510">but you should not do browser [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span data-start="1125310">but do, instead, feature detection.</span> <span data-start="1127770">And the reason is there is a wide variety of input devices</span> <span data-start="1131490">and form factors that Chrome OS can run on.</span> <span data-start="1135090">So you might have a touch screen or you might not.</span> <span data-start="1137250">Some lower end devices don't have a touch screen.</span> <span data-start="1139650">There might be a trackpad or it might be the Acer Tab 10 tablet</span> <span data-start="1143970">that I mentioned earlier.</span> <span data-start="1146137">There might be a keyboard.</span> <span data-start="1147220">So if your app can use keyboard shortcuts,</span> <span data-start="1149250">it's good to add support for them.</span> <span data-start="1151770">There may be a mouse, so add support for that</span> <span data-start="1154530">if it makes sense.</span> <span data-start="1155340">There might also be a stylus, useful for drawing apps.</span> <span data-start="1160110">Also make sure to build responsive and take advantage</span> <span data-start="1163020">of all the screen real estate.</span> <span data-start="1164640">This is an example of an app that</span> <span data-start="1167160">supports a large or wide display, rather,</span> <span data-start="1169850">and displays a number of days in the weather forecast.</span> <span data-start="1172740">But also, if it's resized for phone-size screen,</span> <span data-start="1175770">it shows less information.</span> <span data-start="1177640">And you can even support a rolled up state</span> <span data-start="1180600">if the user just wants to glance at the weather</span> <span data-start="1182970">continuously if they have OCD.</span> <span data-start="1185700">But for a media player — </span> <span data-start="1187919">that would be a more useful example — </span> <span data-start="1189460">you can have previous and next controls.</span> <span data-start="1193170">I actually have OCD and I do that often.</span> <span data-start="1196240">And this is an example from Starbucks.</span> <span data-start="1199830">They found that building responsive</span> <span data-start="1201900">pays off because users would actually order on the desktop</span> <span data-start="1205680">and use their mobile device to pick up their order.</span> <span data-start="1210420">So build responsive.</span> <span data-start="1213240">It also pays off to optimize your forms because nobody</span> <span data-start="1216270">likes to fill in the forms.</span> <span data-start="1217840">And to have some guidance —  g.co/AmazingWebForms.</span> <span data-start="1221940">That's an amazing URL.</span> <span data-start="1223520">And if you want to handle touch in an optimized fashion,</span> <span data-start="1227250">check out g.co/WebTouch.</span> <span data-start="1230230">There are also pointer events, and these</span> <span data-start="1232350">are a unifying model for all sorts of pointer input — </span> <span data-start="1236370">touch, trackpad, mouse, stylus.</span> <span data-start="1238830">And you have a lot of events that</span> <span data-start="1241220">are supported in the Chrome, Firefox, Opera, IE,</span> <span data-start="1243800">Edge, and Samsung, such as pointer move.</span> <span data-start="1247110">You just need to add a listener for it or — </span> <span data-start="1250620">sorry.</span> <span data-start="1251370">You have pointer enter, pointer down, pointer up,</span> <span data-start="1255360">cancel out, leave, and so on.</span> <span data-start="1256950">More at the g.co/PointerEvents.</span> <span data-start="1260780">And this is an example of a code that distinguishes</span> <span data-start="1264060">between the pointing device — </span> <span data-start="1266340">you can check if there is mouse or touch or pen or something</span> <span data-start="1269730">that has not yet been supported by the browser.</span> <span data-start="1274140">OK, so what's going to happen in the future?</span> <span data-start="1278680">We are working on improving the desktop PWA support.</span> <span data-start="1281810">One improvement is keyboard shortcuts.</span> <span data-start="1284100">Another one is badging for the launch icon.</span> <span data-start="1286135">So we don't have to notify the user for everything.</span> <span data-start="1288260">You can display a number of notifications,</span> <span data-start="1290970">just like for Android and iOS apps.</span> <span data-start="1294060">And then also, link capturing, which</span> <span data-start="1295830">would make Twitter very happy.</span> <span data-start="1297310">They have a great PWA, but when you click on a link,</span> <span data-start="1299880">it's not captured yet.</span> <span data-start="1301950">So in the future, we hope to enable this,</span> <span data-start="1304081">such that when you click on a link that your app can handle,</span> <span data-start="1306580">your app will actually open and handle that link.</span> <span data-start="1309070">And for that, you need to define the scope parameter</span> <span data-start="1311800">in the manifest.</span> <span data-start="1313480">And the scope parameter is used to determine</span> <span data-start="1316180">when your user has left your web app</span> <span data-start="1318460">and needs to be bounced in a tab.</span> <span data-start="1323500">We are also working on low-latency canvas contexts,</span> <span data-start="1325960">which are introduced in Chrome 71 Beta.</span> <span data-start="1328730">And these are very useful for highly interactive apps.</span> <span data-start="1333400">They use OpenGLES for rastering, and how it works</span> <span data-start="1337840">is that your pixels get written to the front buffer directly.</span> <span data-start="1343040">So this bypasses several steps of the rendering process,</span> <span data-start="1346240">and Chrome writes there in that piece of memory</span> <span data-start="1348700">that is used by the Linux rendering</span> <span data-start="1351610">subsystem and the scanned [INAUDIBLE] screen.</span> <span data-start="1355130">So this low-latency context runs the risk of tearing,</span> <span data-start="1357880">but if you don't interact with a DOM,</span> <span data-start="1359770">such as in a game or other highly interactive app,</span> <span data-start="1362650">it's useful to use it.</span> <span data-start="1366830">This is an example of how to set up a low-latency canvas</span> <span data-start="1369900">context.</span> <span data-start="1370470">You pass the latency parameter true,</span> <span data-start="1373170">and also, it needs to be opaque, so you pass alpha false.</span> <span data-start="1378790">And this is the last slide.</span> <span data-start="1380650">I had no idea what to put on it, but I</span> <span data-start="1383110">figured that I should add that Chromebooks</span> <span data-start="1386110">are these convergence machines that</span> <span data-start="1387730">run Linux, Android, and Google Play</span> <span data-start="1390760">natively without emulation.</span> <span data-start="1392740">So they run very fast.</span> <span data-start="1394450">You should totally take advantage of the 75%</span> <span data-start="1396730">off discount, and please do explore Chromebooks and give us</span> <span data-start="1401160">feedback.</span> <span data-start="1401660">We love feedback.</span> <span data-start="1402790">We have the Chromium OS dev group — </span> <span data-start="1405230">the Google Group.</span> <span data-start="1406210">And also, the sub-reddit, Crostini.</span> <span data-start="1410126">If you find issues, please check if they've</span> <span data-start="1412050">been reported at crbug.com.</span> <span data-start="1414200">Otherwise, file them using Shift-Alt-I,</span> <span data-start="1417700">and add the Crostini tag.</span> <span data-start="1419860">And we are Dan and Steve, and thank you.</span> <span data-start="1424060">[MUSIC PLAYING]</span> </section>
