<section><span data-start="6750"><span class="speaker">Jason Chase</span>: Good morning, everyone.</span> <span data-start="8260">So I lead a Chrome team whose mission</span> <span data-start="10290">is to help developers better understand and control</span> <span data-start="12900">the web platform.</span> <span data-start="14590">So we've been working on feature policy</span> <span data-start="16650">and reporting API, which we think</span> <span data-start="18660">can really make your lives easier as web developers.</span> <span data-start="21784">Maybe it won't save you from speeding tickets,</span> <span data-start="23700">like Nicole said, but we'll see what we can do.</span> <span data-start="27762">So we know there's many benefits to being on the web.</span> <span data-start="29970">But as a development platform, it's far from perfect.</span> <span data-start="34170">On the Chrome team, we regularly provide</span> <span data-start="35940">web consults to help people address issues with their site.</span> <span data-start="40830">Now, these consults bring together developer relations,</span> <span data-start="44820">engineering, and other folks to help people</span> <span data-start="47190">deep dive into questions or issues with their site.</span> <span data-start="50340">Now, the goal is to provide actual recommendations</span> <span data-start="52500">to improve things.</span> <span data-start="54510">Now, as a result, we've identified common mistakes that</span> <span data-start="58500">happen over and over again.</span> <span data-start="61686">And —  spoiler alert —  performance</span> <span data-start="63060">is a common theme here.</span> <span data-start="64790">And the two big performance problems we see</span> <span data-start="66900">are too much script and too many image bytes</span> <span data-start="69674">being sent over the network.</span> <span data-start="73950">So you know there's a right way to do things.</span> <span data-start="76640">But it's an adventure to find that sometimes.</span> <span data-start="78940">And even if you find the right way, there's bumps.</span> <span data-start="81740">Or you might slip off the path.</span> <span data-start="83900">So as we've seen in other talks, there's</span> <span data-start="85700">a long list of things to keep track of and get right.</span> <span data-start="89300">Now, this is hard enough if you're an expert developer.</span> <span data-start="92015">But imagine you have a dev team with junior developers</span> <span data-start="94265">and you need to keep everyone on the same page.</span> <span data-start="99400">So we need help.</span> <span data-start="101567">What if we could make web development easier</span> <span data-start="103400">with guardrails?</span> <span data-start="105180">So if you imagine guardrails along a path — </span> <span data-start="107615">if you hit a rail, you know you're doing something wrong.</span> <span data-start="111500">And the rails stop you from leaving the path.</span> <span data-start="114650">Now, this isn't necessarily a new idea.</span> <span data-start="117840">But looking at repeated mistakes in our web consults,</span> <span data-start="120680">we're thinking about different ways to apply this.</span> <span data-start="123750">Concretely, how could we help you put guardrails in place</span> <span data-start="127500">for development?</span> <span data-start="130530">So AMP gives us examples — </span> <span data-start="133170">an example of guardrails and web development.</span> <span data-start="135730">AMP gives guarantees you're not going to veer off course</span> <span data-start="138800">by making it nearly impossible to do things wrong.</span> <span data-start="143070">Now, AMP started by providing building blocks, tightly</span> <span data-start="146300">constrained, to ensure great performance in UX.</span> <span data-start="150125">So this is an [INAUDIBLE] approach</span> <span data-start="152060">to carve off good parts of the web platform.</span> <span data-start="155780">Now, not everyone can or wants to use AMP.</span> <span data-start="159530">So learning from AMP, we thought about a more configurable</span> <span data-start="162410">approach.</span> <span data-start="163800">And that's Feature Policy.</span> <span data-start="166430">So we're really excited about it.</span> <span data-start="167840">We think it's going to be a great tool</span> <span data-start="169423">to help guide you towards the well-lit path</span> <span data-start="171310">to web development.</span> <span data-start="174710">Now, with Feature Policy you opt into a set</span> <span data-start="176750">of policies for the browser to enforce throughout your site.</span> <span data-start="181070">These policies restrict which features the site can access — </span> <span data-start="184820">or modify the browser's default behavior for certain features.</span> <span data-start="190400">So let's talk through some of the common problems we've seen.</span> <span data-start="194610">So images often have extra quality or metadata</span> <span data-start="197380">that take up space but isn't required.</span> <span data-start="201490">Now, as we've seen in other talks,</span> <span data-start="203200">again, there's many tools to optimize images.</span> <span data-start="205390">But you have to remember to use them.</span> <span data-start="208000">Or you have to integrate them into your build pipeline.</span> <span data-start="212470">Now ideally, your page should never</span> <span data-start="214630">serve images that are larger than the version that's</span> <span data-start="217330">rendered on-screen.</span> <span data-start="219250">Anything larger just results in wasted bytes</span> <span data-start="222040">and slows down page load time.</span> <span data-start="225230">So a common example might be sending a desktop-size hero</span> <span data-start="228350">image to a mobile device.</span> <span data-start="232860">We've designed policies to catch common mistakes</span> <span data-start="235240">of un-optimized or oversized images.</span> <span data-start="239150">So we researched the impact that we</span> <span data-start="241090">think these policies can have on 10,000</span> <span data-start="242995">of the most popular sites.</span> <span data-start="245840">Our analysis shows that 10% of sites</span> <span data-start="248060">can save over 500 kilobytes on average.</span> <span data-start="251280">Now, that can reduce load time by up to 10 seconds on a 3G</span> <span data-start="255870">network.</span> <span data-start="259470">So let's take a quick look.</span> <span data-start="261529">So this shows the policies being applied to a site.</span> <span data-start="264500">Now on the left, policy for un-optimized images</span> <span data-start="268270">is turned off.</span> <span data-start="269940">And you can see, the images load at normal.</span> <span data-start="273030">On the right, we've turned on the policy.</span> <span data-start="276180">And it's blocked one of the images.</span> <span data-start="278860">So we compute a compression ratio of bytes to pixels.</span> <span data-start="283920">And if that ratio is greater than 0.5,</span> <span data-start="286830">it will block the image and will show a placeholder.</span> <span data-start="289630">So the idea is to point out the images that</span> <span data-start="291630">need to be corrected.</span> <span data-start="296050">So this site might look familiar.</span> <span data-start="299450">At Google, we're big believers in dog-fooding.</span> <span data-start="302260">So we went and applied all the policies we could to the site.</span> <span data-start="305290">Lo and behold, we found out we made a few mistakes.</span> <span data-start="308900">So we applied a bunch of policies.</span> <span data-start="313310">But it was actually the oversized images policy</span> <span data-start="315790">that caught that we were sending some images that were too big.</span> <span data-start="318970">So oops!</span> <span data-start="320736">It just shows that even the experts,</span> <span data-start="322630">like our developer relations team, can make mistakes.</span> <span data-start="326230">So we really need better tooling to help</span> <span data-start="328480">catch these kind of things.</span> <span data-start="331540">So another common problem is images without explicit sizes.</span> <span data-start="336550">Now, as we see on the left, this can cause your user experience</span> <span data-start="340000">to jump around as the browser loads</span> <span data-start="342480">the new images and resizes the page.</span> <span data-start="345580">Now, on the right, we've applied a policy to catch this.</span> <span data-start="349270">So the browser can set these images to a fixed size.</span> <span data-start="351709">And it'll keep your user experience stable.</span> <span data-start="358060">So how does this all work?</span> <span data-start="359910">Policies, like I said before, are a contract</span> <span data-start="361900">between developer and browser.</span> <span data-start="364930">We use them to inform the browser</span> <span data-start="366790">about our intent for our site.</span> <span data-start="369310">It's a set of rules for how each page should behave.</span> <span data-start="372540">Now, the browser helps keep us honest</span> <span data-start="374540">when our page tries to veer off the path,</span> <span data-start="376840">by validating that it's behaving according to its stated rules.</span> <span data-start="382330">So if a page or embedded third-party content</span> <span data-start="385650">attempts to violate any of the rules,</span> <span data-start="387670">the browser will identify or block the behavior.</span> <span data-start="390100">And in some cases, it may override the behavior</span> <span data-start="392910">to write a better user experience.</span> <span data-start="396420">All right, let's take a look at how you configure policies.</span> <span data-start="399200">Now, each policy refers to a single feature.</span> <span data-start="403090">And then it defines a list of origins that</span> <span data-start="404960">are allowed to use the feature.</span> <span data-start="408390">Now, with each page response, you</span> <span data-start="410220">can add this Feature Policy HTTP header.</span> <span data-start="413874">So in this example here, this will</span> <span data-start="415290">catch all oversized images.</span> <span data-start="417870">And this is the one that saved our bacon on the CDS site.</span> <span data-start="421970">Now here, the "none" keyword means</span> <span data-start="423990">that no origin is allowed to use the feature</span> <span data-start="426960">of oversized images, disabling it entirely for your site.</span> <span data-start="433640">Now, looking at that example, you</span> <span data-start="435190">might wonder why we would say, oversized images are a feature.</span> <span data-start="438920">Now, we have policies for helping</span> <span data-start="440295">you enforce best practices, to ensure good performance</span> <span data-start="443540">and user experience.</span> <span data-start="445520">And the way these often work is, we'll</span> <span data-start="447440">define a known bad practice as a feature.</span> <span data-start="450080">And then you use the policy to prevent it.</span> <span data-start="453830">Now, we do this for web-compatible reasons.</span> <span data-start="457140">We don't want to go ahead and break the internet</span> <span data-start="459140">by all the sudden turning off oversized images for everyone.</span> <span data-start="462440">So we'll allow that behavior by default.</span> <span data-start="465330">And then you opt in to turn it off.</span> <span data-start="470390">Now, this header applies a policy</span> <span data-start="472060">that catches any images that are not optimized.</span> <span data-start="476050">Now here, we're making an explicit exception</span> <span data-start="478140">for our photo CDN.</span> <span data-start="480360">Now in this case, it might be because our users expect really</span> <span data-start="483900">high-detailed glossy pictures.</span> <span data-start="486180">And those don't compress well.</span> <span data-start="489900">Now, in this case, there's only one origin listed.</span> <span data-start="493500">And all origins will not be allowed.</span> <span data-start="499480">So here's an example that puts them all together.</span> <span data-start="503750">So first, we have a policy that ensures every image has</span> <span data-start="507040">explicit dimensions.</span> <span data-start="508730">So we saw this earlier, preventing your user experience</span> <span data-start="512200">from jumping around.</span> <span data-start="514270">Now second, we have a policy to selectively enable</span> <span data-start="517330">the geolocation feature.</span> <span data-start="519750">So now, we're applying this to our own origin</span> <span data-start="521830">and to our trusted maps provider.</span> <span data-start="524730">The "self" keyword here means the origin</span> <span data-start="527370">of the top-level page.</span> <span data-start="529620">So by combining this with explicit origins,</span> <span data-start="532160">you have full control over who is allowed to use a feature.</span> <span data-start="536470">And then finally, we're allowing any origin to use autoplay.</span> <span data-start="540890">And here, you see an asterisks keyword.</span> <span data-start="543320">That means essentially everyone.</span> <span data-start="545660">So by default, Chrome will only allow autoplay</span> <span data-start="549170">on same-origin iframes.</span> <span data-start="550760">With this policy, we can allow cross-origin iframes</span> <span data-start="553214">to play as well.</span> <span data-start="557350">So in that last example, we saw features</span> <span data-start="559960">in the more traditional sense — </span> <span data-start="561750">well-known APIs that are exposed to the web,</span> <span data-start="563920">like geolocation, camera, full-screen, autoplay.</span> <span data-start="569010">So before, we saw policies about enforcing best practices.</span> <span data-start="573230">So now, we have policies that give you granular control</span> <span data-start="576070">over the features you use.</span> <span data-start="578200">So we've probably all seen this example.</span> <span data-start="580210">You go to a site.</span> <span data-start="580955">And before you interact with the site at all,</span> <span data-start="582830">you get a pop-up to use location or microphone</span> <span data-start="586480">or something like that.</span> <span data-start="588410">So with Feature Policy, you can lock</span> <span data-start="590860">this down to either prevent the use of the feature at all</span> <span data-start="594370">or really just dole it out to specific origins you trust.</span> <span data-start="602870">So we've talked through some examples of an HTTP header.</span> <span data-start="605920">You can also use an Allow attribute</span> <span data-start="608560">to control Feature Policy on iframes.</span> <span data-start="611620">So now, why might you want to do this?</span> <span data-start="613370">Well, as we talked about, you can be really selective.</span> <span data-start="617080">So maybe you have one frame on your site that shows a map.</span> <span data-start="620440">You could use the Allow attribute</span> <span data-start="622810">to grant the geolocation usage to that frame</span> <span data-start="625360">and on no other frames.</span> <span data-start="629020">Now, in the example we see here, this Allow attribute</span> <span data-start="632720">is changing the default for the AutoPlay feature.</span> <span data-start="635551">Well, you'll notice, if you go to generate</span> <span data-start="637300">and embed on YouTube, they're already</span> <span data-start="640000">using this in production today.</span> <span data-start="645570">So we've seen a lot of flexibility</span> <span data-start="647150">in how you can configure Feature Policy.</span> <span data-start="650184">So we built in some rules to make sure they're</span> <span data-start="652100">being applied correctly.</span> <span data-start="654140">So Malte in the keynote talked rather enthusiastically</span> <span data-start="657500">about not using sync-xhr HR.</span> <span data-start="660590">And yes, we do have a policy for that.</span> <span data-start="662210">And AMP is using that in production.</span> <span data-start="665190">So the way the rules apply is, first, policies are inherited.</span> <span data-start="671600">So scripts will inherit the policy</span> <span data-start="673190">of their containing frame.</span> <span data-start="675000">So this means that, for your top-level scripts,</span> <span data-start="678050">they'll inherit the policies of the main document.</span> <span data-start="681660">So this means you can apply the policies at the top.</span> <span data-start="685280">And they cascade down to all nested sub-frames.</span> <span data-start="687860">So in AMP's case, they can set the policy</span> <span data-start="689690">to disable sync-xhr and know that it</span> <span data-start="692180">will be applied to all sub-frames,</span> <span data-start="694460">regardless of how far they might be nested.</span> <span data-start="700230">And this applies to the iframe attribute — </span> <span data-start="702490">Allow attribute as well.</span> <span data-start="704226">So if you have an Allow attribute</span> <span data-start="705600">and you have a header, the stricter of the two policies</span> <span data-start="708570">wins.</span> <span data-start="710430">Now, on the other hand, we have this one-way toggle.</span> <span data-start="715950">So disabling a feature turns it off permanently.</span> <span data-start="718770">So that means, again, in AMP's case,</span> <span data-start="720510">they've turned off the feature with the sync-xhr policy.</span> <span data-start="724210">And that means no frame, nested or otherwise,</span> <span data-start="726300">can turn it back on.</span> <span data-start="731620">Now, for policy supporting best practices,</span> <span data-start="734740">it might not be feasible for the browser</span> <span data-start="736600">to actually block the bad practice before it appears.</span> <span data-start="740490">It can only detect the problem, in some cases,</span> <span data-start="743010">and then break your page in an obvious way or notify you.</span> <span data-start="746446">The goal, in that case, is really</span> <span data-start="747820">to let you know there's a problem to fix.</span> <span data-start="750660">Now, we saw this in the policy for un-optimized images</span> <span data-start="753870">and oversized images.</span> <span data-start="755580">Now, in other cases, the browser can actually</span> <span data-start="757920">block the bad practice, so your site continues to behave well.</span> <span data-start="761820">The policy front-sized media works this way.</span> <span data-start="764640">So it will apply fixed-size to images</span> <span data-start="766710">to prevent the user experience from jumping around.</span> <span data-start="773320">So we have dev tools in Lighthouse</span> <span data-start="775510">to give you great insight into the behavior of your site.</span> <span data-start="778810">So where does Feature Policy fit into your development workflow?</span> <span data-start="783130">Feature Policy lets you set the policies up-front and then</span> <span data-start="786190">catch problems early during development,</span> <span data-start="788200">before anyone writes a lot of code.</span> <span data-start="791612">Now, you can build policies that defaults</span> <span data-start="793320">for new sites or new pages.</span> <span data-start="795390">And this way, you can enforce standards across your dev team.</span> <span data-start="800240">Policies are served with each page and validated at runtime.</span> <span data-start="803640">So you can choose to turn them on for some users and not</span> <span data-start="806120">others.</span> <span data-start="807940">You can also turn them on for some pages in your site</span> <span data-start="810250">and not others, as you incrementally</span> <span data-start="812080">improve your site, for example.</span> <span data-start="814630">So at a minimum we recommend enabling the policies</span> <span data-start="817930">on your staging server.</span> <span data-start="819850">This can let you catch problems that you</span> <span data-start="822640">didn't see during development.</span> <span data-start="824450">For example, you might have your images come from a content</span> <span data-start="828010">management system.</span> <span data-start="829157">And they're not available as you're developing the site.</span> <span data-start="831490">So this can catch problems with that.</span> <span data-start="835450">In addition to staging, you can also</span> <span data-start="837880">apply policies in production.</span> <span data-start="839980">You can have your dev team, your managers — </span> <span data-start="842110">all the way up to your CEO — </span> <span data-start="843460">use your site with policies enabled, so that you can</span> <span data-start="846430">find real issues in the wild.</span> <span data-start="849460">For regular production users, you likely</span> <span data-start="851830">won't enable the policies if violations</span> <span data-start="854530">will break the user experience.</span> <span data-start="857480">So for example, with the image policies,</span> <span data-start="860170">loading un-optimized images more slowly</span> <span data-start="862759">is probably a better experience than having</span> <span data-start="864550">them missing altogether.</span> <span data-start="867130">You still want to know about all these violations,</span> <span data-start="869980">so you can correct them.</span> <span data-start="872580">So we've designed report-only mode</span> <span data-start="874950">to give you the best of both worlds.</span> <span data-start="878240">So you can configure policies similar to the examples</span> <span data-start="881230">we saw before.</span> <span data-start="882310">But you mark them as report-only.</span> <span data-start="884380">So you see here, internal users — </span> <span data-start="887440">they have the policies enabled.</span> <span data-start="889439">We'll break things.</span> <span data-start="890230">We'll see problems with images that need to get corrected.</span> <span data-start="893260">For production users, we have them in report-only mode.</span> <span data-start="896770">So the production users get the normal experience.</span> <span data-start="899320">But then you can get reports about what's gone wrong.</span> <span data-start="905120">So speaking of reporting, Feature Policy violations</span> <span data-start="908870">are really just the start.</span> <span data-start="910260">There's lots of other info from the wild</span> <span data-start="912150">that'll be really valuable — </span> <span data-start="915020">for example, browser interventions.</span> <span data-start="917330">Sometimes, a browser needs to intervene</span> <span data-start="919250">to improve the experience for the end-user.</span> <span data-start="921480">So an example of such a intervention</span> <span data-start="925160">is blocking document.write, unlike 2G connections.</span> <span data-start="928760">So there, we've discovered that doing a document.write</span> <span data-start="933437">on a really slow connection can really</span> <span data-start="935020">impair the user experience.</span> <span data-start="936740">So to protect that, we've just blocked it.</span> <span data-start="939590">But that happens in the wild.</span> <span data-start="941060">You don't know about it.</span> <span data-start="942919">You really want to find out about it,</span> <span data-start="944460">so you can correct it.</span> <span data-start="948270">Now, what else?</span> <span data-start="949360">So just taking a look at this, there's</span> <span data-start="950950">lots of things going on in the wild on your site</span> <span data-start="954566">that you'd really love to know about.</span> <span data-start="957050">Not a problem —  some of these are just console messages,</span> <span data-start="960280">which you can't collect.</span> <span data-start="962170">Now, there's other things that have a bespoke API,</span> <span data-start="964270">like window.onerror.</span> <span data-start="965230">So you have to remember to go hook up something</span> <span data-start="967450">there to get some errors.</span> <span data-start="969370">And then there's things like crashes and network errors</span> <span data-start="971680">that just aren't possible to capture from script.</span> <span data-start="976410">So a solution here is reporting API.</span> <span data-start="978690">This gives you one place to collect all sorts</span> <span data-start="981000">of information from the wild.</span> <span data-start="982290">It's a one-stop shop.</span> <span data-start="985230">It exposes information that wasn't available before.</span> <span data-start="987870">We've talked about network errors, crashes — </span> <span data-start="990810">now, that's coming soon — </span> <span data-start="992790">Feature Policy violations.</span> <span data-start="995160">Deprecations, interventions, and network errors — </span> <span data-start="997810">you can get those today with reporting API.</span> <span data-start="1002300">There's two ways to use reporting.</span> <span data-start="1005380">We have the reporting observer, which</span> <span data-start="1007610">lets you collect reports client-side, with a JS API.</span> <span data-start="1011770">Now, you can filter by report type.</span> <span data-start="1013969">Here, we've said, we just care about deprecations</span> <span data-start="1016010">and Feature Policy violations.</span> <span data-start="1018550">And then you can use a callback to funnel these reports</span> <span data-start="1022040">to your own analytics provider or however you'd</span> <span data-start="1024566">like to capture them.</span> <span data-start="1028160">Now, because it's client-side, the available types</span> <span data-start="1030680">are limited.</span> <span data-start="1032089">But the key feature here is it buffers results.</span> <span data-start="1034460">So you can set up your reporting observer later and still get</span> <span data-start="1037220">reports that happened earlier in page load.</span> <span data-start="1042849">So every report has some common fields.</span> <span data-start="1045880">So we can see here the type of the report and the URL,</span> <span data-start="1049200">where the report happened.</span> <span data-start="1051140">And then, for each report type, there's a specific body.</span> <span data-start="1054230">Now, for Feature Policy violations,</span> <span data-start="1056370">we see it's telling you the feature that you were using.</span> <span data-start="1059002">And it tells you where in your code the violation occurred.</span> <span data-start="1064230">Now, the second way to use reporting</span> <span data-start="1066300">is with the report-to-response header.</span> <span data-start="1069360">So this lets you configure out-of-band delivery reports.</span> <span data-start="1072770">The browser will queue up reports and send them</span> <span data-start="1075230">to the location of your choosing,</span> <span data-start="1077450">separate from the execution of your page.</span> <span data-start="1081120">And so here, you can get all of the report types</span> <span data-start="1083450">that we saw earlier.</span> <span data-start="1086960">So you'll see a couple fields here.</span> <span data-start="1088550">So first, there's Group.</span> <span data-start="1089935">And that just lets you name this particular set of end points.</span> <span data-start="1094600">And then you can refer to that group name</span> <span data-start="1097240">in other parts of your configuration.</span> <span data-start="1100700">Now, max_age says how long this configuration is valid for.</span> <span data-start="1105040">After that, we'll throw away this configuration.</span> <span data-start="1108140">So this lets you know change endpoints over time</span> <span data-start="1111190">and gradually switch to new ones.</span> <span data-start="1113240">And finally, endpoints is an array of URLs.</span> <span data-start="1116170">So you can configure multiple URLs for fallback.</span> <span data-start="1118450">So if the browser can't reach one endpoint,</span> <span data-start="1120550">it'll try another.</span> <span data-start="1125580">And so talking about one place to configure reporting — </span> <span data-start="1129720">CSP, Content Security Policy, now</span> <span data-start="1132240">integrates with the reporting API.</span> <span data-start="1134600">So whereas before, you'd specify a report URI</span> <span data-start="1136835">and you'd give it an URL to where</span> <span data-start="1138210">you wanted your reports to go — </span> <span data-start="1141390">now, you can use the report-to directive.</span> <span data-start="1144480">And you just point it at one of the endpoints you'd previously</span> <span data-start="1147120">configured.</span> <span data-start="1148004">So if we go back to the preview example,</span> <span data-start="1149670">you'd send a report-to header.</span> <span data-start="1151200">And you'd define a group called CSP endpoint.</span> <span data-start="1153610">You can have all the URLs you need there, the age.</span> <span data-start="1155774">And then you just refer back to it here.</span> <span data-start="1161160">So where can you use this stuff?</span> <span data-start="1163990">So both the Feature Policy framework and the reporting API</span> <span data-start="1167580">are shipped in Chrome.</span> <span data-start="1169410">Firefox is implementing Feature Policy.</span> <span data-start="1171960">And Safari has support for the iframe Allow attribute.</span> <span data-start="1176070">Now, what's really great is you can</span> <span data-start="1178080">benefit from using these policies now,</span> <span data-start="1180660">even though there isn't broad support across browsers.</span> <span data-start="1184650">If you do some of your local testing in Chrome</span> <span data-start="1187190">with flags enabled, you can apply all these policies</span> <span data-start="1189860">and catch problems before they reach other environments.</span> <span data-start="1195560">So I've talked a lot about a few policies,</span> <span data-start="1199245">walked through the examples, explaining</span> <span data-start="1200870">why you might want to use them.</span> <span data-start="1202161">But that's really just the start.</span> <span data-start="1203790">So here's a list of all the ones we have available today.</span> <span data-start="1207990">Most of the ones around granular control —  like,</span> <span data-start="1209990">turning on and off features, like, geolocation,</span> <span data-start="1213152">microphone —  those kind of things — </span> <span data-start="1214610">those are already shipped.</span> <span data-start="1215693">So you can use those now.</span> <span data-start="1216980">And we saw that with the YouTube example and with AMP.</span> <span data-start="1220602">And a lot of the best practice policies —  those</span> <span data-start="1222560">are behind a flag.</span> <span data-start="1223760">And we're also working on a bunch more.</span> <span data-start="1229930">Now, seeing that long list, you go, man,</span> <span data-start="1232690">how am I going to set up policies?</span> <span data-start="1234382">How am I going to try them all out?</span> <span data-start="1235840">Well, we have a handy dev tools extension.</span> <span data-start="1239270">So this lets you really easily toggle a policy on and off</span> <span data-start="1242200">and see the effect on your page, so you</span> <span data-start="1244170">don't have to configure the set-up headers</span> <span data-start="1245920">or modify your code to allow attributes.</span> <span data-start="1248880">You can just try it and see what'll happen.</span> <span data-start="1250940">So here, we've seen an example of using the extension</span> <span data-start="1253316">to turn off the geolocation feature.</span> <span data-start="1257550">Now, this extension uses a JavaScript API.</span> <span data-start="1261300">So the advantage there is, you can feature</span> <span data-start="1263610">detect which policies are even supported.</span> <span data-start="1266810">And you can go one step further.</span> <span data-start="1268710">And you can query to see which policies</span> <span data-start="1270500">are enabled or disabled.</span> <span data-start="1272100">So this can allow you to code defensively.</span> <span data-start="1274400">So for example, if you have content that's embedded,</span> <span data-start="1277040">you can respond differently if you know the features that</span> <span data-start="1279460">are available to you.</span> <span data-start="1283080">So we really love to hear if these policies are</span> <span data-start="1285610">useful for you.</span> <span data-start="1287090">The ones we're really interested in are somewhere around some</span> <span data-start="1289750">of the images, and even sync-xhr.</span> <span data-start="1291880">So we've made it easy for you to, hopefully, copy and paste</span> <span data-start="1295300">and get a header sent real quick.</span> <span data-start="1296890">Now, if you have ideas for new policies</span> <span data-start="1298810">or if you have feedback on the existing ones,</span> <span data-start="1300930">we'd love to hear from you on our GitHub repo.</span> <span data-start="1304180">And finally, you can head over to FeaturePolicy.rocks.</span> <span data-start="1307282">And you'll get more information about Feature Policy,</span> <span data-start="1309490">about code samples, and live demos.</span> <span data-start="1313540">Thanks a lot.</span> <span data-start="1314320">[APPLAUSE]</span> <span data-start="1315220">[MUSIC
