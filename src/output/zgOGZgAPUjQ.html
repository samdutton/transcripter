<section><span data-start="6450"><span class="speaker">Thomas Nattestad</span>: My name is Thomas,</span> <span data-start="7950">and I'm the product manager for WebAssembly.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="9784"><span class="speaker">Alex Danilo</span>: My name is Alex, and I'm a software engineer</span> <span data-start="12158">on Chrome OS.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="12990"><span class="speaker">Thomas Nattestad</span>: And today we're</span> <span data-start="13440">going to talk to you about WebAssembly.</span> <span data-start="15064">We're going to start off by briefly</span> <span data-start="17100">describing what WebAssembly is and what you can use it for.</span> <span data-start="19867">Then I want to show off some of the amazing new features</span> <span data-start="22200">that the WebAssembly team has been working on to deliver</span> <span data-start="24990">to you in this last year.</span> <span data-start="26730">Then I'll showcase some of the amazing applications</span> <span data-start="29517">that have managed to build with WebAssembly,</span> <span data-start="31350">and our shipping and production.</span> <span data-start="33791">All right.</span> <span data-start="34290">So first off, what is WebAssembly, actually?</span> <span data-start="37830">WebAssembly is a new language for the web,</span> <span data-start="40680">and offers an alternative to JavaScript for expressing logic</span> <span data-start="43560">on the web platform.</span> <span data-start="45030">It's important to note, though, that WebAssembly is in no way</span> <span data-start="48960">a replacement for JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="51030">Rather, it's designed to fill the gaps that</span> <span data-start="54720">exist in JavaScript today.</span> <span data-start="56520">Specifically, WebAssembly is designed as a compilation</span> <span data-start="59790">target, meaning that you write in higher level languages,</span> <span data-start="62520">such as C++, and then compile into WebAssembly.</span> <span data-start="66720">WebAssembly is also designed to deliver</span> <span data-start="69010">reliable and maximized performance, which</span> <span data-start="71400">is something that can be difficult to get out</span> <span data-start="73500">of JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="75784">Most exciting, though, is the fact</span> <span data-start="77200">that WebAssembly is now shipping in all four major browsers,</span> <span data-start="80260">making it the first new language to be fully supported</span> <span data-start="83140">in every major browser since JavaScript was</span> <span data-start="85240">created more than 20 years ago.</span> <span data-start="88160">All right.</span> <span data-start="88660">So what can you actually do with this?</span> <span data-start="90243">Well, as I already mentioned, because WebAssembly offers</span> <span data-start="92680">maximized and reliable performance,</span> <span data-start="94810">you can now expand the set of things</span> <span data-start="96520">that you can feasibly do in the browser.</span> <span data-start="98530">Things like video editing, complex application, codecs,</span> <span data-start="102370">digital signal processing, and many, many more</span> <span data-start="104620">performance-demanding use cases can now</span> <span data-start="107320">be supported on the web.</span> <span data-start="109800">Secondly, WebAssembly offers amazing portability.</span> <span data-start="112740">Because you can compile from other languages,</span> <span data-start="114690">you can port not only your own applications and libraries</span> <span data-start="117690">but also the wealth of open-source C++ libraries</span> <span data-start="121200">and applications that have been written.</span> <span data-start="124290">Lastly, and potentially most exciting to many of you,</span> <span data-start="126600">is the promise for more flexibility</span> <span data-start="128430">when writing for the web.</span> <span data-start="129870">Since the web's inception, JavaScript</span> <span data-start="131790">has been the only fully supported way</span> <span data-start="135450">to execute code on the web, and now with WebAssembly you</span> <span data-start="138150">have more choice.</span> <span data-start="140619">All right, so now that we all know what WebAssembly is,</span> <span data-start="142910">I want to jump in and show off some of the new features</span> <span data-start="145201">that we've been adding in just the last year.</span> <span data-start="147350">First off is source maps.</span> <span data-start="149400">You likely all know how important source maps are</span> <span data-start="151867">when you're working with something like TypeScript</span> <span data-start="153950">or Babel, but it's even more important</span> <span data-start="156230">when you're trying to debug your WebAssembly code.</span> <span data-start="158960">Source maps let you turn something</span> <span data-start="160820">that looks like this into something just slightly more</span> <span data-start="163880">friendly, like this.</span> <span data-start="166040">With source maps you can see the specific line of code</span> <span data-start="168710">where an error has occurred and you can also</span> <span data-start="170900">set breakpoints and have the program actually pause</span> <span data-start="173390">at the appropriate moment.</span> <span data-start="176150">One of the big feature requests that we've heard from users</span> <span data-start="178880">is for better performance when you're starting up</span> <span data-start="182150">your application so that your module can actually</span> <span data-start="184400">get going faster.</span> <span data-start="185600">And for that we've created streaming compilation.</span> <span data-start="188480">In the past, when you wanted to compile a module</span> <span data-start="190520">you had to wait for the entire module</span> <span data-start="192061">to be loaded off of the network, and only then could</span> <span data-start="194450">you move on and actually compile it.</span> <span data-start="196850">Now with streaming compilation, you</span> <span data-start="198470">can start compiling each piece of your module</span> <span data-start="200930">immediately, even before the other parts have</span> <span data-start="202970">finished downloading.</span> <span data-start="205390">To show you what that actually looks like,</span> <span data-start="207140">here's a simple example where we called a fetch function — </span> <span data-start="210510">or fetch for a WebAssembly Fibonacci module,</span> <span data-start="213940">and then we just passed that fetch promise directly</span> <span data-start="216430">into WebAssembly.inst antiateStreaming,</span> <span data-start="219100">and it takes care of all of this underlying bits</span> <span data-start="222340">and pieces for you to deliver this experience.</span> <span data-start="226440">We did some profiling at different network speeds</span> <span data-start="229020">to see the impact of this.</span> <span data-start="230760">We found that all the way up until 50 megabits</span> <span data-start="233160">per second network speed, the network</span> <span data-start="235290">was actually the primary bottleneck,</span> <span data-start="237210">and that the compilation was done as soon as the module was</span> <span data-start="240030">loaded.</span> <span data-start="240990">It wasn't until you hit the 100 megabits per second speeds</span> <span data-start="244080">that you actually needed additional time past the time</span> <span data-start="246750">it took to download the module in order to fully</span> <span data-start="248760">compile and get it going.</span> <span data-start="251510">To make startup time even faster,</span> <span data-start="253470">the team built and launched an entire new compiler</span> <span data-start="256519">that we called the Liftoff compiler.</span> <span data-start="259160">This Liftoff compiler takes the WebAssembly byte code</span> <span data-start="262310">that comes down off of the wire and then starts executing it</span> <span data-start="265370">immediately.</span> <span data-start="266660">The WebAssembly module is then taken off the main thread</span> <span data-start="269750">and optimized further by the TurboFan optimizing compiler.</span> <span data-start="273560">When TurboFan is done optimizing the WebAssembly code,</span> <span data-start="276350">it's then hot swapped in directly</span> <span data-start="277910">without any need for explicit developer action.</span> <span data-start="282260">Unity did some benchmarking on the effects that Liftoff had.</span> <span data-start="286280">On a benchmark where they tried to load a very large game,</span> <span data-start="289200">they found that it went from taking seven seconds to load</span> <span data-start="292340">the game to less than one second, which</span> <span data-start="294230">makes all of the difference when you're waiting</span> <span data-start="296240">to get into a game experience.</span> <span data-start="298977">Probably the biggest feature that the team's</span> <span data-start="300810">been working on this year is WebAssembly threads.</span> <span data-start="303620">WebAssembly threads lets you run fast, highly paralyzed code</span> <span data-start="307220">for the first time across multiple browsers.</span> <span data-start="309650">It also lets you bring existing libraries and applications</span> <span data-start="312680">that use threaded code such as Pthreads to the web.</span> <span data-start="316127">This is such a big feature that I'm actually</span> <span data-start="317960">going to leave most of the explanation to Alex later on.</span> <span data-start="322244">But before I get into that, I want</span> <span data-start="323660">to show off some of the cool new applications</span> <span data-start="325877">that have already been building and launching with WebAssembly</span> <span data-start="328460">this last year.</span> <span data-start="330320">First off is SketchUp.</span> <span data-start="332360">SketchUp is a 3D modeling software</span> <span data-start="334310">that you can learn and start using really quickly.</span> <span data-start="336710">Unlike traditional computer-aided design,</span> <span data-start="338660">most people can learn SketchUp almost right away.</span> <span data-start="341780">SketchUp lets people draw in perspective and then</span> <span data-start="343970">push-pull things into 3D.</span> <span data-start="346310">In no time, people can draw and redesign a living room,</span> <span data-start="348890">plan out a do-it-yourself project,</span> <span data-start="350660">or create and export a model for 3D printing.</span> <span data-start="353326">This app is a lot of fun and you should all check it out,</span> <span data-start="355700">which you can do right now instantly, just</span> <span data-start="357770">by going to app.sketchup.com.</span> <span data-start="360390">SketchUp has been around for a desktop application,</span> <span data-start="362750">but the team's strategy has always</span> <span data-start="364520">been to expand and broaden the market</span> <span data-start="366710">of people who can use 3D modeling,</span> <span data-start="368600">and by making it simple and easy to use</span> <span data-start="371120">and accessible to everyone.</span> <span data-start="373900">Delivering the app over the web was a critical step</span> <span data-start="376510">in that strategy, and the team knew</span> <span data-start="378569">that they wanted to use the same code</span> <span data-start="380110">base as their desktop applications,</span> <span data-start="382810">because rewriting their entire application in JavaScript</span> <span data-start="385270">was just simply not an option.</span> <span data-start="387400">The team's approach was to use the WebAssembly and Emscripten</span> <span data-start="391630">compiler to compile their core 3D modeler</span> <span data-start="394990">and bring it to the web.</span> <span data-start="397060">The initial port took two engineers only three months</span> <span data-start="400270">to bring to the web, which is pretty phenomenal when</span> <span data-start="403120">you realize just how drastically it expanded</span> <span data-start="405100">the reach of their application.</span> <span data-start="408096">The early focus for SketchUp has always</span> <span data-start="409720">been on the next generation of 3D modelers,</span> <span data-start="412180">and today SketchUp is already one</span> <span data-start="413560">of the most popular apps on the G Suite for education</span> <span data-start="416020">marketplace.</span> <span data-start="417121">At the same time, the app has opened up a subscription model</span> <span data-start="419620">for SketchUp, and in just over six months,</span> <span data-start="421940">the team has increased its paying customer base by 10%.</span> <span data-start="425320">SketchUp has also seen consistent growth</span> <span data-start="427270">in session time, returning visitor percentage,</span> <span data-start="429670">and active users.</span> <span data-start="432620">Moving on, the next application that I want to mention</span> <span data-start="435170">is Google Earth.</span> <span data-start="436316">I'm happy to say that Google Earth has successfully</span> <span data-start="438440">gotten their application ported to WebAssembly, including</span> <span data-start="442160">the newly added support for WebAssembly threads.</span> <span data-start="444722">The best part is that they actually</span> <span data-start="446180">got this threaded build working in both Chrome and Firefox,</span> <span data-start="449660">making Google Earth the first WebAssembly</span> <span data-start="452180">multi-threaded application to be running in multiple browsers.</span> <span data-start="456970">Google Earth did some benchmarking,</span> <span data-start="458500">comparing their single threaded version</span> <span data-start="460510">to their multi-threaded version.</span> <span data-start="462400">They found that the frame rate almost</span> <span data-start="464350">doubled when they went to their threaded version,</span> <span data-start="466630">and the amount of jank/dropped also reduced by more than half.</span> <span data-start="473250">All right, so the last big company</span> <span data-start="475320">and launch that I want to mention is Soundation.</span> <span data-start="478500">Soundation is a web-based music studio</span> <span data-start="480390">that enables anyone to make music</span> <span data-start="482070">online with a wide selection of instruments, loops, samples,</span> <span data-start="485790">and effects.</span> <span data-start="487050">No additional hardware or installation or storage</span> <span data-start="489660">is required.</span> <span data-start="490530">Everything is accessible instantly and everywhere.</span> <span data-start="493560">Soundation's mission is to facilitate musical creativity</span> <span data-start="496710">in the world, and they do this by offering</span> <span data-start="499380">a powerful, accessible, and affordable service</span> <span data-start="501990">to the growing demographic of casual producers.</span> <span data-start="504870">As an online web app, Soundation streamlines</span> <span data-start="507030">the ability for producers to connect with peers,</span> <span data-start="509760">get feedback, enter competitions, and even get</span> <span data-start="511950">record deals.</span> <span data-start="514110">Soundation is using a wide variety</span> <span data-start="516900">of advanced web features to deliver this smooth experience.</span> <span data-start="520450">And the first of these is audio worklets.</span> <span data-start="522860">Launched in Chrome 66, the audio worklet</span> <span data-start="525450">brings fast performance and extensible audio processing</span> <span data-start="528450">to the web platform.</span> <span data-start="529862">It could be used in conjunction with other cutting edge web</span> <span data-start="532320">technologies such as WebAssembly and SharedArrayBuffer.</span> <span data-start="536810">Soundation is also one of the world's first adopters</span> <span data-start="539150">of WebAssembly threads, and they use these threads</span> <span data-start="541550">to achieve fast parellelized processing to seamlessly mix</span> <span data-start="545060">songs.</span> <span data-start="546661">So let's have a look at their architecture</span> <span data-start="548410">and see if we can learn anything.</span> <span data-start="550060">On the JavaScript side of the world,</span> <span data-start="551560">they have their application UI.</span> <span data-start="553420">That application UI then talks to an audio mixing engine.</span> <span data-start="557680">This audio mixing engine then spawns off</span> <span data-start="559600">multiple different worker threads in WebAssembly,</span> <span data-start="562120">and each of these worker threads can</span> <span data-start="563620">talk to the same piece of SharedArrayBuffer memory.</span> <span data-start="566530">This SharedArrayBuffer memory is then</span> <span data-start="568360">passed on to the mixing threads, which further passes it</span> <span data-start="571180">to the audio worklet, which produces the final result.</span> <span data-start="575230">Here's a visualization showing the performance improvements</span> <span data-start="578100">on rendering a song as they added multiple threads.</span> <span data-start="580830">Adding just a single additional thread doubled</span> <span data-start="583164">their performance, and by the time</span> <span data-start="584580">they've added five threads, they had more than</span> <span data-start="586496">tripled the performance of their application.</span> <span data-start="590290">So that's a great visualization showing the performance</span> <span data-start="593340">improvements that thread can bring,</span> <span data-start="594810">but since this is Soundation, I thought we would instead</span> <span data-start="597143">try and listen to it.</span> <span data-start="598360">So here is us trying to render a song in Soundation</span> <span data-start="601380">in the single threaded version of WebAssembly.</span> <span data-start="603530">And fair warning, this is not going</span> <span data-start="605310">to be an entirely pleasant experience.</span> <span data-start="607197">[STATICY MUSIC]</span> <span data-start="611970">So as you can imagine, this is not the experience</span> <span data-start="614390">that you want when you're trying to create beautiful music.</span> <span data-start="617090">But luckily Soundation succeeded in launching with WebAssembly</span> <span data-start="620360">threads, and now they're able to deliver</span> <span data-start="622340">an experience that sounds just a little bit better.</span> <span data-start="626642">[SMOOTH MUSIC]</span> <span data-start="630050">So as you can see, not only is this a much more</span> <span data-start="632480">pleasant experience, but the CPU also</span> <span data-start="635210">has additional cycle for other work.</span> <span data-start="639300">All right, so I want to close off my segment by just talking</span> <span data-start="641800">about some of the amazing community</span> <span data-start="643630">projects that we've seen people working on out there.</span> <span data-start="647125">And the first of these that I want to mention</span> <span data-start="649000">is the awesome work that's been done by the Mozilla</span> <span data-start="651125">team and the Rust community to bring Rust to the web</span> <span data-start="654070">through WebAssembly.</span> <span data-start="655510">They have an awesome set of tools and materials</span> <span data-start="657820">to help you get started, and you can check those out</span> <span data-start="660040">at rustwasm.github.io.</span> <span data-start="663286">Speaking of languages, we've also</span> <span data-start="664660">seen more than 30 different projects</span> <span data-start="666830">trying to bring other languages to the web through WebAssembly.</span> <span data-start="670270">These languages include ones like Perl, Python, Ruby,</span> <span data-start="673210">Kotlin, OCaml, Go, PHP, and the .NET framework.</span> <span data-start="677900">Many of these languages require garbage collection,</span> <span data-start="680117">which isn't currently something that's</span> <span data-start="681700">supported in WebAssembly, though we are working on it.</span> <span data-start="684790">These languages come to the web by actually taking</span> <span data-start="687040">their garbage collection system and other runtime bits</span> <span data-start="689590">and compiling that itself down to WebAssembly,</span> <span data-start="692410">and then shipping everything down to the application page.</span> <span data-start="696007">This is a great strategy for getting started</span> <span data-start="697840">and experimenting with some of these languages on the web,</span> <span data-start="700270">but because of some of their performance and memory</span> <span data-start="702395">characteristics, these aren't currently suited</span> <span data-start="704560">for production applications.</span> <span data-start="706480">The fully supported languages today are C, C++, and Rust,</span> <span data-start="710110">but everything else should still be considered experimental.</span> <span data-start="713780">And there are so many more amazing community projects</span> <span data-start="716300">that I don't have time to do justice.</span> <span data-start="718200">We've seen people porting Gameboy emulators, GNU</span> <span data-start="721430">libraries, digital signal processing, and even</span> <span data-start="724400">entire operating system like Microsoft Windows 2000 now</span> <span data-start="728720">available in a browser tab, which</span> <span data-start="730520">is, if not a exactly pleasant experience,</span> <span data-start="734180">definitely interesting.</span> <span data-start="735560">You can check out all of these demos</span> <span data-start="737120">and much more at the forum where we have multiple demos</span> <span data-start="740660">set up for you to check out.</span> <span data-start="742470">And with that, I want to hand it back off to Alex</span> <span data-start="744846">to talk to you more about WebAssembly threads</span> <span data-start="746720">and how to use some of these features.</span> <span data-start="749004">[APPLAUSE]</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="753350"><span class="speaker">Alex Danilo</span>: Thank you, Thomas.</span> <span data-start="754770">One of the kind of big things at the conference</span> <span data-start="756889">here, when we talk about the browser,</span> <span data-start="758430">we talk about using the platform.</span> <span data-start="760230">And quite often people think of the platform as the software</span> <span data-start="763380">stack that's inside the browser, but I</span> <span data-start="765540">like to think of it a little bit different.</span> <span data-start="767520">I like to think about the hardware, the platform that's</span> <span data-start="769811">actually in your machine.</span> <span data-start="771550">So here is an artist's rendition of the inside</span> <span data-start="774720">of a desktop microprocessor.</span> <span data-start="776300">This is what you see today if you</span> <span data-start="777690">take the plastic off the top.</span> <span data-start="779020">So at the top, we have the green bit,</span> <span data-start="780780">which interfaces to the PCI bus, used</span> <span data-start="783210">to be called the northbridge.</span> <span data-start="784740">The left and right, you have memory interfaces.</span> <span data-start="786870">These little yellow boxes are integrated memory controllers.</span> <span data-start="790100">And you see all these blue tiles here.</span> <span data-start="792070">And what they are is cores.</span> <span data-start="794790">So each of those is a CPU core in its own right.</span> <span data-start="797549">So this may be a desktop microprocessor, but even</span> <span data-start="799590">in your pocket, if you have an iPhone or an advanced Android</span> <span data-start="802440">phone, you'll have something like six</span> <span data-start="804151">to eight cores in there, ready to be</span> <span data-start="805650">used to do good computing work.</span> <span data-start="808200">So when you write a normal web application,</span> <span data-start="810460">you're looking at something like this.</span> <span data-start="812572">You have one core running and so you have</span> <span data-start="814280">all this silicon doing nothing.</span> <span data-start="815571">So you're not really using the platform.</span> <span data-start="817649">Now we've seen people come along and do something</span> <span data-start="819690">like spawn a web worker to do the hard work,</span> <span data-start="822150">and have the main thread for UI.</span> <span data-start="823860">In that case, you're running a double threaded application.</span> <span data-start="826940">And so you're using the platform a bit better,</span> <span data-start="829380">but you're not really doing everything you could.</span> <span data-start="832200">Now since we have introduced WebAssembly threads,</span> <span data-start="834630">you can do stuff like this.</span> <span data-start="835990">You could actually use many cores for your application.</span> <span data-start="839290">And as we saw with the Soundation demo,</span> <span data-start="841030">there's visible improvement in the user experience.</span> <span data-start="844210">So I'd really like you to start thinking</span> <span data-start="846210">about how you can adapt your application</span> <span data-start="848030">to use all these cores.</span> <span data-start="850900">Now when you create a web worker,</span> <span data-start="852370">you have to understand that that is a threading primitive</span> <span data-start="854820">and they run concurrently.</span> <span data-start="855930">So you can do compute in parallel.</span> <span data-start="858380">And this is a primitive that we all know pretty well.</span> <span data-start="861140">But one of the things about when we do something</span> <span data-start="863410">like this, if we have an app, on the left,</span> <span data-start="865370">we have what we call the main thread — </span> <span data-start="867220">we're all familiar with the main thread — </span> <span data-start="868960">that interacts and talks to the DOM.</span> <span data-start="872290">The worker that we generate is what</span> <span data-start="874220">we call the background thread.</span> <span data-start="875470">So it's running in parallel but it doesn't actually</span> <span data-start="877600">have the ability to call web APIs</span> <span data-start="879490">and interact with the DOM and stuff like that.</span> <span data-start="882560">But when you create workers, and you create them</span> <span data-start="885400">normally with a JavaScript thing, it creates an instance.</span> <span data-start="889900">So these instances kind of sit on their own on the side,</span> <span data-start="893260">they're running parallel, they don't get</span> <span data-start="895154">to do anything with the DOM.</span> <span data-start="896320">So they kind of run on the side.</span> <span data-start="897820">So if you create one, you get V8 hanging off</span> <span data-start="901420">the top of your main thread, and you get an instance hanging off</span> <span data-start="904180">your worker.</span> <span data-start="905140">So then if you go and create a bunch of workers,</span> <span data-start="907480">you get a bunch more V8 instances.</span> <span data-start="910150">Now each of these instances consumes memory.</span> <span data-start="913152">So that means that if you start spawning lots of JavaScript</span> <span data-start="915610">workers to make your application do stuff more complex,</span> <span data-start="919525">it will actually consume more and more memory</span> <span data-start="921400">and you might run out on a phone, or something like that.</span> <span data-start="924350">But I'll let you in on a little secret.</span> <span data-start="926860">They don't talk to each other.</span> <span data-start="929420">So you've got separate bits of JavaScript</span> <span data-start="931210">running in all these parallel threads,</span> <span data-start="933070">but they don't communicate.</span> <span data-start="934420">They don't have any shared state.</span> <span data-start="936040">They're literally another copy of V8 sitting in memory.</span> <span data-start="939367">The way these things can talk to each other,</span> <span data-start="941200">though, is with postMessage.</span> <span data-start="942592">And postMessage is kind of like sending a paper plane over.</span> <span data-start="945050">I'll send it from this worker to that one,</span> <span data-start="947260">I'll sit around and wait for it to arrive,</span> <span data-start="949090">and there's no predictability about when</span> <span data-start="950756">that will be delivered.</span> <span data-start="952030">So it's not a great experience for a true multi-threaded</span> <span data-start="954370">application.</span> <span data-start="956426">Now, when the team built WebAssembly threads,</span> <span data-start="958300">they implemented something that looks a lot more like this.</span> <span data-start="961620">So what happens is, this is an example of, say,</span> <span data-start="963790">having three threads.</span> <span data-start="965380">So under the hood, we actually spin up the three web workers</span> <span data-start="969310">but the difference here is that the WebAssembly module</span> <span data-start="972310">is shared between the workers.</span> <span data-start="973700">So there is one copy of the code,</span> <span data-start="975310">so you're not consuming nearly as much memory.</span> <span data-start="977650">But more importantly, they share state,</span> <span data-start="979562">and the way they share state is through a thing</span> <span data-start="981520">called SharedArrayBuffer.</span> <span data-start="983282">So if you're a JavaScript engineer,</span> <span data-start="984740">you probably know what a typed array is, because you use them</span> <span data-start="987281">day to day.</span> <span data-start="988030">So SharedArrayBuffer is basically the exact same thing,</span> <span data-start="990830">except that it can be shared across workers.</span> <span data-start="993250">And so what that means is the state</span> <span data-start="995710">of the execution of the application is visible to any</span> <span data-start="998530">of the workers in parallel.</span> <span data-start="1000910">Now if you farm off something into a pool of workers</span> <span data-start="1003890">and you have it hanging off your main app,</span> <span data-start="1005640">it will look something like this.</span> <span data-start="1007112">You'll have your main thread for your main application that</span> <span data-start="1009570">can talk to the DOM, it can use all the web APIs,</span> <span data-start="1012720">and it can see the SharedArrayBuffer,</span> <span data-start="1014670">and that SharedArrayBuffer is being</span> <span data-start="1016590">manipulated by all the parallel threads in the WebAssembly</span> <span data-start="1019290">module.</span> <span data-start="1021710">OK, but by now you're probably thinking,</span> <span data-start="1024390">this is all well and good, but how</span> <span data-start="1026040">do I use this stuff in my actual application?</span> <span data-start="1028270">So I'll start with a very simple example.</span> <span data-start="1030480">We'll do an example which is just a little Fibonacci program</span> <span data-start="1033839">that runs in two threads.</span> <span data-start="1035069">So it will look a bit like this.</span> <span data-start="1036780">There'll be the main thread, the background thread,</span> <span data-start="1038952">the WebAssembly module, all talking</span> <span data-start="1040410">to the SharedArrayBuffer.</span> <span data-start="1041609">So we just take some source code,</span> <span data-start="1043504">which will be something like this,</span> <span data-start="1044920">which is just a bit of C code.</span> <span data-start="1046545">And what we want to do is we want</span> <span data-start="1047920">to compile that into a form that we can use in parallel threads.</span> <span data-start="1052290">And the way we do that is with the Emscripten tool chain.</span> <span data-start="1055260">So it has a compiler called EMCC,</span> <span data-start="1057529">and there are a couple of flags here,</span> <span data-start="1059070">though, I want to point out.</span> <span data-start="1060490">The first one is -s USE_PTHREADS=1.</span> <span data-start="1063930">What that does is turn on the multi-threading support</span> <span data-start="1066870">when you're compiling your WebAssembly module.</span> <span data-start="1069540">The second flag that's interesting is -s</span> <span data-start="1071550">PTHREAD_POOL_SIZE=2.</span> <span data-start="1073710">What this does is tells the compiler</span> <span data-start="1075510">that I want to pre-allocate two threads for my application.</span> <span data-start="1078960">So when I actually start the WebAssembly module</span> <span data-start="1081660">it will pre-create two threads and get going with that.</span> <span data-start="1085440">Now this is kind of visualization</span> <span data-start="1087300">what would happen.</span> <span data-start="1088050">If you set PTHREAD pool size to two,</span> <span data-start="1090210">you get the picture on the left, you get two workers,</span> <span data-start="1093120">and if you set it to eight you get eight workers.</span> <span data-start="1095220">And that happens at startup time of your web app.</span> <span data-start="1098280">Now you may be wondering why you care about the number.</span> <span data-start="1100650">Well, the thing is that you should really try and set it</span> <span data-start="1104100">to the maximum number of threads.</span> <span data-start="1105930">If you say I only want two threads,</span> <span data-start="1107700">and then suddenly your application needs</span> <span data-start="1109366">three or four, it's a bit of a problem.</span> <span data-start="1111310">So what happens is that the WebAssembly module</span> <span data-start="1113670">has to yield to the main thread before it</span> <span data-start="1115560">can create that worker.</span> <span data-start="1116650">So if you're relying on all the threads being</span> <span data-start="1119040">there at the startup, you need to set the number high enough.</span> <span data-start="1121882">But of course, if you set that number too high,</span> <span data-start="1123840">you're wasting memory.</span> <span data-start="1124756">So this is something to tune.</span> <span data-start="1126190">So in Soundation's case they used five threads</span> <span data-start="1128494">and it works really well for them.</span> <span data-start="1129910">So when you're tuning your apps you need to think about it.</span> <span data-start="1133364">OK, so if you want to get out there and actually try</span> <span data-start="1135530">this stuff, which I'm sure you're all</span> <span data-start="1137071">dying to, if you fire up Chrome 70</span> <span data-start="1139760">and navigate to Chrome flags and search for WebAssembly thread</span> <span data-start="1142700">support, change the setting here from default</span> <span data-start="1145880">to enabled, and at that point, you'll</span> <span data-start="1147680">have to restart your browser.</span> <span data-start="1149020">And then you can start building stuff and testing it locally.</span> <span data-start="1152570">Now once you've built a working WebAssembly thread app,</span> <span data-start="1155269">you probably want to deploy it out to the public.</span> <span data-start="1157310">And the way you do that is by getting an origin trial token.</span> <span data-start="1160980">So an origin trial token is tied to your domain</span> <span data-start="1163460">and you get it from us.</span> <span data-start="1164884">And you basically —  it's just a meta tag</span> <span data-start="1166550">that you put on the page.</span> <span data-start="1167591">And that tells the browser, hey, these people</span> <span data-start="1169850">are trying WebAssembly threads and let's use it.</span> <span data-start="1172156">So if you want to go ahead and do that,</span> <span data-start="1173780">and I encourage you all to do so, just go to this short link,</span> <span data-start="1176881">and there's a form you can fill in, put</span> <span data-start="1178505">in your URL, the reason you want to use this stuff,</span> <span data-start="1182090">and go start building something really cool.</span> <span data-start="1185930">Now of course, as developers, we spend most of our times</span> <span data-start="1189100">in DevTools trying to debug things, which is how it is.</span> <span data-start="1192460">So in Chrome 70 at the moment, which is released to stable,</span> <span data-start="1195640">you can single step instructions.</span> <span data-start="1197406">And that is a WebAssembly instructions.</span> <span data-start="1199030">So it looks a little bit like this,</span> <span data-start="1200950">like not friendly, as Thomas pointed out.</span> <span data-start="1203560">So you can see this little box up here,</span> <span data-start="1205376">which is showing you the threads.</span> <span data-start="1206750">So this is a two thread application running.</span> <span data-start="1209650">And this box is the actual WebAssembly disassembled code.</span> <span data-start="1213010">So it's not the binary, it's a text form of the instructions</span> <span data-start="1216340">that are in the module.</span> <span data-start="1217621">And you can single step those and it's all</span> <span data-start="1219370">very well and good, but realistically, we don't really</span> <span data-start="1222550">like that debugging experience.</span> <span data-start="1224380">So Chrome 71 brings source map support,</span> <span data-start="1226900">as Thomas mentioned earlier.</span> <span data-start="1228680">So source maps lets you change what you saw before</span> <span data-start="1231520">into something —  oop, next slide — </span> <span data-start="1233950">something that looks like this.</span> <span data-start="1236060">So this is the source code of the Fibonacci function sitting</span> <span data-start="1241090">in Dev Tools, and you can single step over instructions,</span> <span data-start="1244270">you can set breakpoints, you can do all stuff like that.</span> <span data-start="1247910">Now, if you want to actually do this yourself</span> <span data-start="1250030">and you want to generate the source map,</span> <span data-start="1251770">you just need to set two flags on the EMCC compiler command</span> <span data-start="1255340">line.</span> <span data-start="1255880">The first is -g, which says generate debug symbols,</span> <span data-start="1259290">and the second is  — source-map-base,</span> <span data-start="1261950">and that points to a URL where it will actually</span> <span data-start="1264580">find the source map file.</span> <span data-start="1266302">In this case, I'm using local host,</span> <span data-start="1267760">so I'll be using it on my own workstation.</span> <span data-start="1272090">OK, so I'll just recap on what we've talked about today,</span> <span data-start="1274600">just so you can remember what we talked about.</span> <span data-start="1276940">The first thing is it's streaming compilation,</span> <span data-start="1278860">which lets the browser compile the WebAssembly</span> <span data-start="1281170">module as it comes over the wire, which is launched now.</span> <span data-start="1283690">It's in Chrome 70, which speeds things up.</span> <span data-start="1286450">The second is Liftoff, which is the tiered compiler,</span> <span data-start="1289010">so you get the first compile really fast so your app starts,</span> <span data-start="1291970">and then hot swaps in the better code a bit later on.</span> <span data-start="1295190">Then we have, of course, WebAssembly threads shipping</span> <span data-start="1297520">now in Chrome 70, and you can use it with an origin trial,</span> <span data-start="1300730">so you can ship it to your customers</span> <span data-start="1302230">and they can use it and play with it.</span> <span data-start="1304570">And of course, Chrome 71, which will be out really soon,</span> <span data-start="1307090">contains source maps, which means</span> <span data-start="1309040">that it's a lot easier to debug your code.</span> <span data-start="1311290">And so I'd encourage all of you people</span> <span data-start="1312880">out there to start writing using WebAssembly threads,</span> <span data-start="1316037">because it unlocks the power of the supercomputer that's</span> <span data-start="1318370">sitting in your pocket right now.</span> <span data-start="1321040">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="1322120">[MUSIC PLAYING]</span> </section>
