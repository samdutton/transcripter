<section><span data-start="6690"><span class="speaker">François Beaufort</span>: You are tired.</span> <span data-start="8189">I can feel it, so I will cut to the chase.</span> <span data-start="10780">Media on the web matters.</span> <span data-start="12660">And I'm not just saying it because I deeply</span> <span data-start="14490">believe in this.</span> <span data-start="16230">Let me share some numbers with you.</span> <span data-start="18750">Almost 40,000 years of video are watched every day in Chrome.</span> <span data-start="24800">You may want to take some time to digest this.</span> <span data-start="29980">30% of all time on Chrome for Android</span> <span data-start="32810">is spent watching video, and it is about 15%</span> <span data-start="36570">of all time on Chrome for Android.</span> <span data-start="39120">It is huge.</span> <span data-start="41640">And I'm not the only one to have noticed it.</span> <span data-start="44160">Media PWAs across the world have seen business impact.</span> <span data-start="48270">Spotify globally and Ghana in India</span> <span data-start="51570">are both in great success.</span> <span data-start="53580">And it's just the beginning.</span> <span data-start="56810">In the next 20 minutes or so, Angie and I</span> <span data-start="59060">will watch you [INAUDIBLE].</span> <span data-start="60590">We think will help you build great and modern media</span> <span data-start="63470">experiences.</span> <span data-start="64800">We'll cover multitasking with picture-in-picture, bandwidth</span> <span data-start="68510">saving with the 81 video codec, a brand new way of switching</span> <span data-start="72860">codec seamlessly, and finally, playback quality predictability</span> <span data-start="77690">with the media capabilities API.</span> <span data-start="82290">Let me tell you a little bit about myself first</span> <span data-start="84390">and how I work.</span> <span data-start="86250">I love to multitask on my computers</span> <span data-start="88560">doing many thing at the same time — </span> <span data-start="90630">browsing, obviously, writing some code,</span> <span data-start="93600">sharing news on social media platforms,</span> <span data-start="96120">watching educational videos, and so on.</span> <span data-start="98620">This is what I do on a daily basis.</span> <span data-start="100770">And I'm quite sure I'm not the only one to do that.</span> <span data-start="103500">But you may wonder, Francois, this looks cool,</span> <span data-start="106620">but are you good at it?</span> <span data-start="108510">Does that make you more productive?</span> <span data-start="111420">This does not matter.</span> <span data-start="113860">I love to do that, and I want to be efficient at it.</span> <span data-start="116440">But it is not always easy.</span> <span data-start="118590">For instance, watching a video while I'm coding,</span> <span data-start="122770">how's that work?</span> <span data-start="124120">First, I have to open a separate YouTube window,</span> <span data-start="127110">move it to a corner of my screen,</span> <span data-start="129100">and making sure other windows are not covering it.</span> <span data-start="131440">And only then I can start to enjoy.</span> <span data-start="134240">But can you imagine my frustration</span> <span data-start="136090">when window position are not remembered,</span> <span data-start="138580">or when some new window open in the middle of my little video?</span> <span data-start="143600">But that's OK.</span> <span data-start="144820">That's OK, because today, a brand new web API</span> <span data-start="147040">called picture-in-picture solved that very specific use case.</span> <span data-start="151680">Picture-in-picture, also known as PIP,</span> <span data-start="153960">is a common feature in television</span> <span data-start="156210">that allows users to watch video in a floating window</span> <span data-start="159930">always on top of other window, so that they</span> <span data-start="162554">can keep an eye on what they're watching while interacting</span> <span data-start="164970">with other sites' obligations.</span> <span data-start="167580">The BBC website actually picture-in-picture a month ago.</span> <span data-start="170790">And they're quite happy with the early result they got.</span> <span data-start="173990">Now, like I said earlier, I like to write code.</span> <span data-start="176110">So let me show some code.</span> <span data-start="179019">To enter picture-in-picture on the video element,</span> <span data-start="181060">you simply have to call request picture-in-picture</span> <span data-start="183700">on a video element.</span> <span data-start="185110">And because this call is asynchronous,</span> <span data-start="187180">it will return a promise that can either resolve or reject.</span> <span data-start="190640">And I'll explain why it can reject in a bit.</span> <span data-start="193150">The important thing to notice here</span> <span data-start="194800">is that the user has to interact with the page first</span> <span data-start="197470">to be able to enter picture-in-picture.</span> <span data-start="200020">In this example, I use the button.</span> <span data-start="204620">Making this button a toggle button</span> <span data-start="207960">is quite straightforward.</span> <span data-start="209930">By checking if the video element is not</span> <span data-start="211850">the document that picture-in-picture element,</span> <span data-start="214190">in other words, already in picture-in-picture,</span> <span data-start="216320">I'll proceed as before.</span> <span data-start="218120">If it is, let's call document dot exit picture-in-picture.</span> <span data-start="222490">Requesting picture-in-picture may reject for several reasons.</span> <span data-start="226820">The most common ones being the video metadata not</span> <span data-start="229330">loaded yet, picture-in-picture not supported by the platform,</span> <span data-start="233260">or simply not allowed by the user.</span> <span data-start="235820">The full list of reasons is available in the documentation.</span> <span data-start="240480">Updating your website when the video</span> <span data-start="242790">is playing in [INAUDIBLE] picture-in-picture is crucial.</span> <span data-start="246070">And you may think that waiting for the request</span> <span data-start="248040">picture-in-picture promise to wait is good enough,</span> <span data-start="250440">but it is not.</span> <span data-start="252750">What if the video enters picture-in-picture from</span> <span data-start="255060">another path, for instance?</span> <span data-start="256839">What if the user clicked the browser context menu,</span> <span data-start="259170">for instance, or the browser triggered picture-in-picture</span> <span data-start="262200">automatically, like Chrome does on full-screen video</span> <span data-start="264990">on Android?</span> <span data-start="266460">This is why I strongly recommend you update your layout</span> <span data-start="270000">and enter and leave picture-in-picture event</span> <span data-start="272070">listeners.</span> <span data-start="274900">Now, having a 4K video playing in a small window</span> <span data-start="278740">may not be what you want.</span> <span data-start="279930">So to adjust the quality of the video</span> <span data-start="284470">based on the picture-in-picture window size,</span> <span data-start="286390">you can simply check the width and height</span> <span data-start="288160">attribute of the picture-in-picture window</span> <span data-start="290350">available in the enter picture-in-picture event.</span> <span data-start="293500">Too many picture-in-picture, I know.</span> <span data-start="297630">Adding a resize amount to this object</span> <span data-start="299479">would also let you know when to user resize</span> <span data-start="301270">the picture-in-picture window so that you</span> <span data-start="303520">can update the video quality.</span> <span data-start="305110">By the way, Angie will work you later</span> <span data-start="307870">on how to change seamlessly the video quality</span> <span data-start="310180">and the codec container to help with that.</span> <span data-start="314620">And finally, defining the availability of your custom</span> <span data-start="317550">picture-in-picture button should be</span> <span data-start="319290">as easy as taking the Boolean value of document dot</span> <span data-start="322350">picture-in-picture enable, but it is not.</span> <span data-start="324810">Because you want your website to be perfect.</span> <span data-start="327640">So you also have to check if the HTML video attribute</span> <span data-start="330730">desirable picture-in-picture is present.</span> <span data-start="333730">And finally, for real this time, you</span> <span data-start="335700">have to check if the video is actually ready to play.</span> <span data-start="338450">And only then, you'll get a perfect implementation</span> <span data-start="341010">for your custom picture-in-picture button</span> <span data-start="343200">in your media player.</span> <span data-start="345970">I'm glad to say that we have shaped picture-in-picture API</span> <span data-start="348550">last month Chrome 70 in Linux, Mac and Windows.</span> <span data-start="352480">Chrome OS and Android are coming soon.</span> <span data-start="354437">And we're looking forward to see all the browser vendors</span> <span data-start="356770">implement this API as well.</span> <span data-start="359530">You'll find all documentation and sample units at this URL.</span> <span data-start="364920">Now, what if I tell you this is just the tip of the iceberg?</span> <span data-start="369210">In Chrome 71, currently, beta will support media stream video</span> <span data-start="374070">in picture-in-picture.</span> <span data-start="377930">These two little lines up java script</span> <span data-start="379910">do what you think it does.</span> <span data-start="381890">Your web cam video stream in a picture-in-picture</span> <span data-start="384010">in picture window.</span> <span data-start="385370">And this already makes me happy.</span> <span data-start="387920">And in case you're wondering, those are real fake glasses.</span> <span data-start="394420">[LAUGHTER]</span> <span data-start="400570">But wait, there's more.</span> <span data-start="402370">Soon, a brand new web API, called screen capture,</span> <span data-start="404890">will allow a website in Chrome to capture a screen to a media</span> <span data-start="408280">stream for recording or sharing over the network.</span> <span data-start="411730">This API will enable a number of web applications,</span> <span data-start="414350">including screen sharing.</span> <span data-start="416620">Imagine now if you combine these APIs with picture-in-picture.</span> <span data-start="420430">Let's have a look at this code.</span> <span data-start="422380">After getting the screen, we display media.</span> <span data-start="425710">And the voice audio stream will get user media.</span> <span data-start="428920">I create from scratch a new media stream,</span> <span data-start="431860">but contains the screen video stream,</span> <span data-start="434500">including my picture-in-picture window and my voice</span> <span data-start="437920">as the audio stream.</span> <span data-start="439950">This code is simply gorgeous, in my opinion.</span> <span data-start="442640">This is it.</span> <span data-start="444020">There's nothing more.</span> <span data-start="446770">So let me show what this code does with short demo I've</span> <span data-start="449250">created just for you.</span> <span data-start="451440">And can we switch to demo, please?</span> <span data-start="456350">So on the left is me, Francois, the hardcore gamer.</span> <span data-start="461630">On the right, it's still me, but this time, as a casual viewer.</span> <span data-start="465430">And what you're going to see on the left</span> <span data-start="467420">is me sharing my screen, including</span> <span data-start="471020">the picture-in-picture window, while I'm</span> <span data-start="472912">playing the diner game.</span> <span data-start="477220">So this is me.</span> <span data-start="480570">Hi, mom.</span> <span data-start="485900">And let's say [INAUDIBLE].</span> <span data-start="489620">So like I said, I'm a hardcore game — </span> <span data-start="492250">OK, sorry, I lied.</span> <span data-start="493280">[LAUGHTER]</span> <span data-start="496602">So keep in mind that the code you've just</span> <span data-start="498310">seen with 10 more lines of java script</span> <span data-start="500510">involving the media we called API and some web sockets</span> <span data-start="504140">are pretty much the entire code for this demo.</span> <span data-start="508160">Can we switch back to the slides, please?</span> <span data-start="511770">The demo is available for you on Glitch</span> <span data-start="513600">if you want to play with it later on.</span> <span data-start="517200">Now, some of you may have noticed that</span> <span data-start="518870">the picture-in-picture window contains only two buttons — </span> <span data-start="522289">a play/pause button and a close button.</span> <span data-start="524690">Those are blue there.</span> <span data-start="526291">We've talked to other brother vendors interested</span> <span data-start="528290">in picture-in-picture about this,</span> <span data-start="529664">and we're happy to share that the media</span> <span data-start="531560">session API we've talked about last year [INAUDIBLE]..</span> <span data-start="534930">We'll be using a new feature to add and customize some actions</span> <span data-start="538790">to picture-in-picture window.</span> <span data-start="540680">Think of seat backwards, forward, previous track,</span> <span data-start="543500">next track, and even new ones.</span> <span data-start="546410">If you are already using it for your mobile website,</span> <span data-start="549480">this will come for free.</span> <span data-start="551550">To illustrate these upcoming possibilities,</span> <span data-start="554310">imagine a web app that shows the poster image of a podcast show,</span> <span data-start="558450">for instance, in a picture-in-picture window,</span> <span data-start="561090">all right up, and use these window media</span> <span data-start="563610">controls to tailor the media experience.</span> <span data-start="566730">I think that looks cool.</span> <span data-start="567810">And this is coming as well.</span> <span data-start="571440">So to summarize, picture-in-picture</span> <span data-start="573390">is great for multitasking.</span> <span data-start="575940">And in near future, it may also be</span> <span data-start="577710">used to record your screen with your webcam</span> <span data-start="580620">or even to create a custom media center always</span> <span data-start="583380">on top of other windows that users can access easily.</span> <span data-start="588230">I think we all agree that picture-in-picture</span> <span data-start="590390">improves a lot the user experience in general.</span> <span data-start="593270">And you know what else improves it a lot?</span> <span data-start="595700">Video codec.</span> <span data-start="596810">And talk about this, let me introduce</span> <span data-start="599060">Angie Chiang, a software engineer working</span> <span data-start="600856">on video compression.</span> <span data-start="601730">[MUSIC PLAYING]</span> <span data-start="602954">[APPLAUSE]</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="606724"><span class="speaker">Angie Chiang</span>: Thank you.</span> <span data-start="611550">Thank you, Francois.</span> <span data-start="613320">Hi, everyone.</span> <span data-start="614470">I'm Angie from Google's web engine.</span> <span data-start="617130">Today, I'm going to share with you</span> <span data-start="620070">a new generation video codec, AV1, was launched recently.</span> <span data-start="627160">So we have three main goals for AV1.</span> <span data-start="630040">First off, we want AV1 to provide state-of-the-art</span> <span data-start="635550">compression efficiency among other codecs.</span> <span data-start="639420">Secondly, we want AV1 to be accessible by everyone,</span> <span data-start="643660">so we made it an open source project, and it's royalty-free.</span> <span data-start="647790">Finally, we want to deploy AV1 right away and quickly.</span> <span data-start="653850">So before I jump into how we did or will</span> <span data-start="657390">do to achieve these goals, let me explain a little bit</span> <span data-start="661050">why video compression is important for users.</span> <span data-start="668180">To visualize the importance of compression for video service,</span> <span data-start="675030">let me give you an example.</span> <span data-start="677060">Using Edge 264, a five minute HD-compressed video</span> <span data-start="682480">will take about 300 megabytes.</span> <span data-start="685380">On the other hand, the uncompressed version</span> <span data-start="688700">will take about 25 gigabytes, 80 times larger</span> <span data-start="693590">than the compressed version.</span> <span data-start="696050">This means, without video compression,</span> <span data-start="698780">watching video online will eat up all your internet</span> <span data-start="701570">bandwidth, not to mention the sky-rocket costs of storage</span> <span data-start="707780">on the cloud.</span> <span data-start="711500">So more compression gives the user better user experience.</span> <span data-start="715730">We have seen the proof of this with VP9,</span> <span data-start="718940">the predecessor of AV1.</span> <span data-start="721540">YouTube did a comprehensive AV experiment when launching VP9.</span> <span data-start="728060">Compared to H.264, performance improved in a number of ways,</span> <span data-start="733650">ultimately result in higher watch time.</span> <span data-start="736820">This is due to VP9's outperforming coding</span> <span data-start="739400">efficiency.</span> <span data-start="742970">With AV1, we have done it again.</span> <span data-start="745930">A new generate codec provides 30% [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span data-start="749880">reduction over VP9 across a variety of video qualities.</span> <span data-start="756080">This means, given the [INAUDIBLE] quality,</span> <span data-start="761000">AV1's video size will be 30% smaller than VP9.</span> <span data-start="765800">This project integrated over 100 algorithm tools,</span> <span data-start="770610">including the technologies from open source projects,</span> <span data-start="773840">like Mozilla's [INAUDIBLE] project</span> <span data-start="775700">and Cisco's SOAR project.</span> <span data-start="779630">And again, AV1 is an open source project, and it's royalty-free.</span> <span data-start="785390">So its development community alliance for open media</span> <span data-start="791450">has attracted 40 companies to join and to contribute</span> <span data-start="796190">their technologies into AV1.</span> <span data-start="799330">There are content providers, streaming service providers,</span> <span data-start="803450">and power companies which cover a wide spectrum</span> <span data-start="807050">of the ecosystem for video on the web.</span> <span data-start="810350">Having Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla</span> <span data-start="814940">means we can have AV1 to work everywhere on the web platform.</span> <span data-start="822100">So we have been working hard toward this goal.</span> <span data-start="825030">In this quarter, AV1 decoder is supported by Chrome browser.</span> <span data-start="831090">And we started sorting video content from YouTube.</span> <span data-start="835440">Firefox and Edge are also launched in the beta platform</span> <span data-start="840450">last month.</span> <span data-start="842010">And we plan to integrate the AV1 with web RTC</span> <span data-start="846020">and to deploy AV1 into Android platform</span> <span data-start="848550">in the following years.</span> <span data-start="850990">[INAUDIBLE] support is also under development,</span> <span data-start="854290">first arriving in 2020 for TVs and mobile handsets.</span> <span data-start="861780">For web developers, using AV1 is easy.</span> <span data-start="864970">You simply need to code its type supported function to make sure</span> <span data-start="868650">the browser support AV1.</span> <span data-start="870904">Then you can start play the video.</span> <span data-start="875940">So AV1 is very exciting.</span> <span data-start="877980">But rolling out AV1 is not easy.</span> <span data-start="881040">To ease the process of the codec transition.</span> <span data-start="885780">a new change type function is supported</span> <span data-start="887940">on Chrome browser, which allow the browser to switch one</span> <span data-start="892800">codec to the other seamlessly.</span> <span data-start="895900">So for example, when AV1 is not performing</span> <span data-start="898600">on some low-end devices, the string service</span> <span data-start="902400">can always fall back to VP9, which is less complex</span> <span data-start="905780">and may have [INAUDIBLE] support.</span> <span data-start="911460">Here is a simple call for using change type.</span> <span data-start="914170">So initially, we add a source buffer using VP9.</span> <span data-start="918520">And later on, we can call a change type function</span> <span data-start="921220">to switch to AV1.</span> <span data-start="925080">Let me give you some demo about change type.</span> <span data-start="946520">So we start playing video using Edge 264.</span> <span data-start="951080">You can see that from the top left corner,</span> <span data-start="958300">by

<section><span data-start="1013700"><span class="speaker">François Beaufort</span>: Thank you.</span> <span data-start="1014270">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="1014640">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="1018500">Did you ever wish you could predict the future?</span> <span data-start="1021930">I know I did.</span> <span data-start="1022980">Be some kind of fortune teller.</span> <span data-start="1025369">I personally would love to jump into my future,</span> <span data-start="1028099">have a quick look, and just come back.</span> <span data-start="1030609">Out of curiosity, I asked people around me</span> <span data-start="1032430">what they would do with this kind of power.</span> <span data-start="1034611">Some said they would love to know if they</span> <span data-start="1036319">would become grandparents.</span> <span data-start="1037870">Some would like to see if their project is</span> <span data-start="1039619">going to be successful.</span> <span data-start="1041060">And some obviously would simply look</span> <span data-start="1042980">for upcoming lottery numbers.</span> <span data-start="1045599">Now brace yourself.</span> <span data-start="1047099">In a sense, the media capabilities</span> <span data-start="1049560">API allows you to predict the future,</span> <span data-start="1052710">but only for a media playback on the web.</span> <span data-start="1057130">Until recently, web developer had to rely</span> <span data-start="1059200">solely on web API such as is type supported</span> <span data-start="1062350">or can play type to discover whether media could be decoded.</span> <span data-start="1066100">While this told them whether media could be played at all,</span> <span data-start="1069380">it didn't provide an indication of whether the media</span> <span data-start="1072040">playback would drop lots of frame</span> <span data-start="1074170">or rapidly drain device battery.</span> <span data-start="1076930">In the absence of the signal, developer</span> <span data-start="1079720">had to create their own heuristic,</span> <span data-start="1081460">or just assume that if a device can play back</span> <span data-start="1084040">a combination of codec and resolution,</span> <span data-start="1086680">it could do so smoothly and power efficiently.</span> <span data-start="1090330">For users with less capable devices,</span> <span data-start="1092590">this often led to a very poor experience.</span> <span data-start="1095890">By using the media capabilities API today,</span> <span data-start="1098620">you can get more information about the client's</span> <span data-start="1100820">video decoded performance and make an informed decision</span> <span data-start="1104380">about which codec and resolution to deliver to the user.</span> <span data-start="1108350">In other words, it helps ensure adaptive video streaming</span> <span data-start="1111760">[INAUDIBLE] selection that will play back smoothly</span> <span data-start="1114570">onto the specific device.</span> <span data-start="1117730">Here's how it works in Chrome.</span> <span data-start="1119920">The media capabilities API use metrics from previous playback</span> <span data-start="1123070">to predict whether future playback in the same codec</span> <span data-start="1126220">and at the same resolution will be smoothly decoded.</span> <span data-start="1130150">When you ask this API about a specific media configuration,</span> <span data-start="1133120">it will return asynchronously three Booleans.</span> <span data-start="1137810">Is this configuration supported?</span> <span data-start="1140120">This is the same result returned by these types of body</span> <span data-start="1143109">you can use it for instance to detect</span> <span data-start="1144650">whether everyone video correct is supported by the way</span> <span data-start="1149030">easily by going to be smooth?</span> <span data-start="1151140">It is currently true if less than 10% of frame</span> <span data-start="1154400">have been previously dropped for this media configuration.</span> <span data-start="1158650">Is playback going to be power efficient?</span> <span data-start="1161250">Am I basically going to drain the device battery?</span> <span data-start="1164180">If true, if more than 50% of frame</span> <span data-start="1166770">have been decoded by the hardware for this media</span> <span data-start="1168770">configuration.</span> <span data-start="1171180">Now, warning, this is not some kind of magic API</span> <span data-start="1174480">that will tell you what to play.</span> <span data-start="1177390">You are in control and have to make decisions</span> <span data-start="1179910">about which media configuration to play eventually based</span> <span data-start="1182940">on the result of this API.</span> <span data-start="1186300">Speaking of results, YouTube experimented with the media</span> <span data-start="1189440">capabilities API to prevent the adaptive [INAUDIBLE] algorithm</span> <span data-start="1192450">from selecting a resolution that a device could not</span> <span data-start="1195000">playback exclusively.</span> <span data-start="1196950">For users who were part of the experimental group,</span> <span data-start="1199740">the mean time between rebuffers, also known as MTBR,</span> <span data-start="1203790">increased by 7.1%.</span> <span data-start="1205650">While the average resolution served</span> <span data-start="1207180">to the aggregate group measured by video height</span> <span data-start="1210060">only declined by 0.5%.</span> <span data-start="1213480">These results, as obscure as it may be to some of you,</span> <span data-start="1217050">basically show that some users on low-end devices</span> <span data-start="1220740">saw less frequently on YouTube the frustrating buffering</span> <span data-start="1224220">animation.</span> <span data-start="1225370">So just for that, thank you.</span> <span data-start="1228880">The media capabilities API is available today</span> <span data-start="1230830">in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari Tech Preview.</span> <span data-start="1234310">As you saw, you'll find all documentation and sample</span> <span data-start="1236560">you need at this URL.</span> <span data-start="1240550">Now, if you remember one thing from this talk</span> <span data-start="1243160">about those features, it is [INAUDIBLE] the web matters.</span> <span data-start="1247030">And the web platform is the best place</span> <span data-start="1248680">to serve efficient and delightful major experiences.</span> <span data-start="1253060">One more thing —  you can find all audio and video</span> <span data-start="1257490">updates in Chrome by simply searching for Chrome media</span> <span data-start="1259780">updates on your favorite search engine.</span> <span data-start="1261640">This will allow you to stay up to date with the amazing media</span> <span data-start="1264520">features that Chrome is adding to the web platform</span> <span data-start="1267340">every release.</span> <span data-start="1268930">And with that, I humbly thank you for your time.</span> <span
