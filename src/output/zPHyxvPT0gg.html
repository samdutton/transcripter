<section><span data-start="7087"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: Welcome to Chrome Dev Summit.</span> <span data-start="8920">I'm Ben Galbraith.</span> <span data-start="10120">I lead product for the Chrome platform teams.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="12615"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: And I'm Dior Almaer,</span> <span data-start="13990">and I lead product for our developer ecosystem efforts.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="16282"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: Thanks for joining us here</span> <span data-start="17989">at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts here in San Francisco.</span> <span data-start="21006">And a special shout-out to those of you</span> <span data-start="22630">watching on the livestream.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="23755"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: We look forward all year</span> <span data-start="25296">to this opportunity to gather with developers</span> <span data-start="27250">from around the world to celebrate the web platform.</span> <span data-start="30580">And of course, it's an opportunity for the Chrome team</span> <span data-start="33530">and others here at Google to provide updates</span> <span data-start="36010">on our latest work and get feedback from the community.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="40130"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: 2018 marks 10 years</span> <span data-start="42400">since the launch of Chrome, but it also</span> <span data-start="44680">marks Android's 10-year anniversary,</span> <span data-start="46930">and 20 years since Google was founded, back in 1998.</span> <span data-start="51350">So this is a really big year for us,</span> <span data-start="53620">and it's got us reflecting on these past 10 years.</span> <span data-start="57490">Back in 2008, Dion and I were at Mozilla</span> <span data-start="60040">working on developer tools when we received probably</span> <span data-start="62920">the most unique product announcement we'd ever seen,</span> <span data-start="65500">the Chrome comic, which walked through Chrome's new features,</span> <span data-start="69130">like the Omnibox, and architectural innovations</span> <span data-start="72550">like the multi-process architecture,</span> <span data-start="75010">and the high-performance V8 JavaScript runtime.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="77584"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: And years later, it's</span> <span data-start="79000">really fun to note the V8 was reused by Node.js</span> <span data-start="82720">and plenty of other open source projects out there.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="85870"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: Chrome launched in this time,</span> <span data-start="88210">in the midst of a web renaissance,</span> <span data-start="90010">back in the Ajax movement that saw developers</span> <span data-start="92650">pushing the boundaries of what was possible on the web,</span> <span data-start="96040">doing things that we just hadn't seen before.</span> <span data-start="98390">And it's amazing to see just how far the web has</span> <span data-start="100390">come in these 10 years, with publishers like Huffington</span> <span data-start="103930">Post transforming the typical documents of the web</span> <span data-start="107290">into rich, interactive experiences — </span> </section>

<section><span data-start="109810"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>:  — and Google Maps, an early pioneer</span> <span data-start="111820">of that Ajax era, had gone from maps of tiled images</span> <span data-start="115210">to a street-to-space continuum combining 360-degree photos,</span> <span data-start="119830">vector maps, 3D models, and satellite imagery,</span> <span data-start="123560">all just in the browser.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="125119"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: And productivity apps have come into their own</span> <span data-start="127660">on the platform, with pro tools like the incomparable AutoCAD</span> <span data-start="131710">and the collaborative design platform, Figma.</span> <span data-start="133732">And because they're on the web, you</span> <span data-start="135190">can get right into these things.</span> <span data-start="137230">And when you're done being productive,</span> <span data-start="139030">you can pop into high-quality games like Crossy Road</span> <span data-start="141250">for, you know, just a minute —  just a couple.</span> <span data-start="143290">Just a quick minute.</span> <span data-start="145822">[LAUGHTER]</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="148162"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: And Chrome has changed</span> <span data-start="149620">quite a bit over this time, and more</span> <span data-start="151330">than just these subtle changes to the logo.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="154151"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: Earlier this year, we</span> <span data-start="155650">highlighted Chrome's new refreshed design,</span> <span data-start="157930">and updated usability enhancements such as better tab</span> <span data-start="161110">treatment for people like Dion that have 500 tabs</span> <span data-start="163960">open at a time.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="165042"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: It's true.</span> <span data-start="166000">[CHUCKLING]</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="166960"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: And also a smarter Omnibox and auto-fill</span> <span data-start="170710">features.</span> <span data-start="171490">But the most important update was clearly — </span> </section>

<section><span data-start="173680"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>:  — the birthday mode and the Dino game,</span> <span data-start="175960">which run for the entire month of September.</span> <span data-start="179330">Do you know this is played over 270 million times a month?</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="182385"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: That's incredible.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="183760"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: It kind of is.</span> <span data-start="184885">[CHUCKLING]</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="185500"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: But here at CDS, it's</span> <span data-start="187180">really the platform-related features</span> <span data-start="188876">that we want to talk about.</span> <span data-start="190000">So let's highlight a few.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="192170"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: So back in 2008, Chrome</span> <span data-start="193780">launched with process isolation, an architecture that</span> <span data-start="196490">put each tab in its own operating system process,</span> <span data-start="199720">making Chrome exceptionally stable, but also exceptionally</span> <span data-start="203260">secure.</span> <span data-start="204400">The process boundary acts as a line of defense in the event</span> <span data-start="206860">malicious code is able to exploit a bug</span> <span data-start="209230">and attempt to read data from another tab.</span> <span data-start="211810">Over the past 10 years, this model</span> <span data-start="213730">has become the industry standard.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="215680"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: This year, desktop Chrome browsers</span> <span data-start="217840">took this model further with the launch of Site Isolation.</span> <span data-start="221890">So now, Chrome ensures that even within a single tab,</span> <span data-start="225490">content from different Domains is isolated.</span> <span data-start="228710">So in this example, in the iframe,</span> <span data-start="230590">this news site is using a display ad,</span> <span data-start="233770">and it's running in a different process</span> <span data-start="235600">than the rest of the page.</span> <span data-start="237520">We've wanted to extend process isolation this way</span> <span data-start="239650">for some time, and we think it's an important protection</span> <span data-start="242500">for the web.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="244019"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: Now we've also been continuing our efforts</span> <span data-start="246310">to encourage developers to use HTTPS for all web traffic.</span> <span data-start="250840">This ensures that the content of a site</span> <span data-start="252930">isn't maliciously modified while in transit,</span> <span data-start="255430">and also that user data is transferred securely.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="259070"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: In the latest Chrome,</span> <span data-start="260570">we mark pages as not secure when they're served from HTTP.</span> <span data-start="264980">And when the user begins to interact with form fields,</span> <span data-start="267620">we further emphasize the point with a stronger warning.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="272200"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: The HTTPS movement is a collaborative effort,</span> <span data-start="275140">with organizations like Let's Encrypt</span> <span data-start="277270">playing a big role in lowering the barriers to upgrading</span> <span data-start="279820">sites.</span> <span data-start="280750">And it's working.</span> <span data-start="282130">In Chrome itself, we're seeing big shifts to HTTPS.</span> <span data-start="285520">And over 80% of the top 100 sites are now all HTTPS.</span> <span data-start="290470">We think this is actually a major accomplishment</span> <span data-start="292480">because the web is such a massive ecosystem.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="295669"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: All right.</span> <span data-start="296710">In addition to security and stability,</span> <span data-start="298390">speed was a big theme for Chrome at launch.</span> <span data-start="301390">And V8 is a big part of that story.</span> <span data-start="305320">The team recently posted a retrospective highlighting</span> <span data-start="308200">its improvements over this period, including</span> <span data-start="310660">significant gains in JavaScript execution speed,</span> <span data-start="313660">and a 100x decrease in garbage collection jank.</span> <span data-start="318130">And the team is looking forward to the next 10</span> <span data-start="320920">years of improvements by optimizing V8 for the latest</span> <span data-start="323950">JavaScript language features, like promises and async/await,</span> <span data-start="327730">supporting the Node.js server-side community,</span> <span data-start="330310">and being responsive to the needs of the framework</span> <span data-start="332830">ecosystem.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="334360"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: There's a fun recent example of this — </span> <span data-start="336770">how the team rapidly responded to JavaScript inefficiencies</span> <span data-start="340180">related to the react framework's recently announced hooks</span> <span data-start="343270">feature, finding ways to make this feature</span> <span data-start="345460">work much faster on V8.</span> <span data-start="349000">Now V8 has also expanded to support WebAssembly,</span> <span data-start="351940">also called Wasm, a cross-browser standard</span> <span data-start="354460">for executing low-level code, like C and C++,</span> <span data-start="357550">at very high speed.</span> <span data-start="359544">Earlier this year, the team launched the new Wasm compiler</span> <span data-start="361960">called Liftoff, and the popular Unity game engine</span> <span data-start="364930">found that it resulted in a 10x reduction in the load time</span> <span data-start="368560">for their Wasm code.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="370600"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: And WebAssembly threads</span> <span data-start="372280">are now available in a Chrome origin</span> <span data-start="374440">trial, which opens the door for more complex code</span> <span data-start="377530">to come to the web.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="379275"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: Now it's been really</span> <span data-start="380650">fun to see the community explode the power of WebAssembly,</span> <span data-start="383230">both through new creations and by bringing old code bases — </span> </section>

<section><span data-start="387340"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: Actually, I think I prefer the term vintage code</span> <span data-start="389965">bases.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="390464"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: Vintage —  vintage, high-quality code bases</span> <span data-start="392800">to the web.</span> <span data-start="394000">This tweet was one of my favorites, kind</span> <span data-start="395830">of a in inception moment, because now I</span> <span data-start="398320">think you can run IE on Windows 95 on Chrome on Android.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="402787"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: It's crazy.</span> <span data-start="403870">[LAUGHTER]</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="404200"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: What a world that we live in.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="406060"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: It's hard to believe,</span> <span data-start="406600">but back when Chrome launched, video on the web</span> <span data-start="408558">wasn't a thing.</span> <span data-start="409240">We had to use plugins.</span> <span data-start="410980">And now, of course, HTML video is ubiquitous.</span> <span data-start="415000">This year, Chrome landed support for AV1,</span> <span data-start="418700">which is the next generation media codec, completely</span> <span data-start="421600">royalty-free, that provides a 30% bitrate reduction,</span> <span data-start="425560">even over each HEVC, which makes streaming video on the web</span> <span data-start="430000">faster as this becomes adopted.</span> <span data-start="432370">And because AV1 has major industry backing,</span> <span data-start="435580">we can expect to see it receive significant adoption over time.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="439894"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: Now one constant over the past 10 years</span> <span data-start="442060">is the importance of optimizing images.</span> <span data-start="444680">This is sort of like flossing for the internet — </span> <span data-start="446800">vital for your site's health, yet plenty of us</span> <span data-start="449320">don't really seem to do it enough.</span> <span data-start="450850">And as a Brit, trust me on that one.</span> <span data-start="452470">[BEN CHUCKLING]</span> <span data-start="453710">Now a few years ago, Chrome added support</span> <span data-start="455470">for WebP, a new image format that</span> <span data-start="457210">results in an average 30% savings over other formats</span> <span data-start="460660">like PNG, JPEG, and GIF.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="462644"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: "Jiff."</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="463560"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: What was that?</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="464560"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: No.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="464670"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: Oh, sorry.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="465310"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: I didn't talk.</span> <span data-start="465840">[LAUGHTER]</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="466620"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: And this year, Edge and Firefox</span> <span data-start="468453">ship support for WebP, so make sure</span> <span data-start="470470">your images are fully squooshed.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="473290"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: All right, so the web and Chrome have come</span> <span data-start="475750">a long way these past 10 years.</span> <span data-start="479050">So where do we go from here?</span> <span data-start="481346">We've just spent the last few minutes talking</span> <span data-start="483220">about the importance of speed, and the enhancements to the web</span> <span data-start="486220">platform that make that more possible.</span> <span data-start="489320">And we think this will continue to be a major focus for all</span> <span data-start="492460">of us into the future because speed is one of the defining</span> <span data-start="495520">features of the web platform.</span> <span data-start="498220">It's what makes it so magical to go from a link right</span> <span data-start="500950">into a rich experience, seamlessly, without any delay.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="505665"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: Now delivering speed</span> <span data-start="507040">is a partnership between the browsers and developers.</span> <span data-start="509950">Because no matter how fast and efficient browsers become,</span> <span data-start="513280">a poorly optimized site will always</span> <span data-start="515110">ruin the fast loading experiences</span> <span data-start="516669">that our users want.</span> <span data-start="518580">And increasingly, JavaScript can also become a major factor</span> <span data-start="522179">in slowing down sites.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="523559"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: It's because since 2001, sites</span> <span data-start="525540">use an average eight times more JavaScript</span> <span data-start="528180">than they did before.</span> <span data-start="529652">And that's a problem, because in addition</span> <span data-start="531360">to having to be downloaded, all this code</span> <span data-start="533220">needs to be compiled by the browser and executed.</span> <span data-start="536960">And with mobile, many of the devices</span> <span data-start="539070">that our users are using are slower</span> <span data-start="540540">than they've been before.</span> <span data-start="542170">And so increasingly, performance can include the CPU</span> <span data-start="545790">as a bottleneck.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="546840"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: Now we've created tools</span> <span data-start="548340">like Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights,</span> <span data-start="550200">and the Chrome User Experience Report</span> <span data-start="552000">that can provide deep insights into your site's performance</span> <span data-start="554850">and how it can be improved.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="556675"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: However, as helpful as these tools can be,</span> <span data-start="559050">a pattern we've seen is that a site's performance will degrade</span> <span data-start="561990">over time because we're constantly adding new features</span> <span data-start="565590">to enhance our site.</span> <span data-start="567270">And these new features create pressure for the site</span> <span data-start="570000">to get bigger and bigger.</span> <span data-start="571590">And that includes more script an more resources</span> <span data-start="573750">that have to be downloaded.</span> <span data-start="575196">Of course, we're not saying that we shouldn't</span> <span data-start="577070">be constantly enhancing our sites and adding features,</span> <span data-start="579890">but as we do so, we have to take care</span> <span data-start="582930">that as we add these features we ensure that our pages continue</span> <span data-start="586160">to load fast.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="587527"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: So an approach that we've</span> <span data-start="589110">seen that's led to great results here</span> <span data-start="591090">is the practice of establishing a performance budget.</span> <span data-start="594360">And popular tools and frameworks,</span> <span data-start="596370">like Angular, Preact, and Webpack</span> <span data-start="598650">have built-in support to define budgets and enforce them.</span> <span data-start="602640">These budgets can be based on the bite</span> <span data-start="604230">size of your resources, or they can</span> <span data-start="606090">ensure you hit target metrics and scenarios.</span> <span data-start="608830">For example, you can specify that your site should</span> <span data-start="610950">load in under five seconds on a mid-range smartphone</span> <span data-start="614130">and a high-latency 3G network.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="616440"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: The team at Pinterest</span> <span data-start="617940">have set a great example of using a budget to guide</span> <span data-start="621150">their optimizations efforts.</span> <span data-start="623081">We'd love to share a video that explains this process.</span> <span data-start="625330">now.</span> <span data-start="625950">Let's roll the video.</span> <span data-start="627063">[VIDEO PLAYBACK]</span> <span data-start="628422">[MUSIC PLAYING]</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="630240"><span class="speaker">Zack Argyle</span>: Pinterest's mission is</span> <span data-start="631800">to help people discover things, collect them, organize them,</span> <span data-start="635584">and then find ways to apply them in your life.</span> <span data-start="637500">[PAGE TEARING]</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="638927"><span class="speaker">Ludo Antonov</span>: With more and more people on the go,</span> <span data-start="641010">the mobile web has become central at providing</span> <span data-start="643770">our discovery experience.</span> <span data-start="646790">But our mobile web experience in the past</span> <span data-start="649380">was basically an upsell for the native app.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="653020"><span class="speaker">Zack Argyle</span>: Which brought us to the realization</span> <span data-start="655020">that we needed to fix it.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="874929"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: Now traditionally, this hasn't maybe</span> <span data-start="876970">been the strong suit for the web,</span> <span data-start="878540">but we think that things are changing.</span> <span data-start="880960">So today, we're releasing Squoosh,</span> <span data-start="883075">and it is an example of how responsive complex apps can</span> <span data-start="886690">be on today's web.</span> <span data-start="888730">It demonstrates a really fast loading experience using</span> <span data-start="892450">WebAssembly to compress images using C and C++ libraries,</span> <span data-start="896770">and employing Web Workers to handle long-running tasks</span> <span data-start="899410">in the background, enabling a smooth UI,</span> <span data-start="902110">even while the app works really hard.</span> <span data-start="904720">Now this is a full PWA.</span> <span data-start="906500">It works across mobile, desktop, tablet, and offline, too,</span> <span data-start="910420">thanks to Service Worker.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="912150"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: Let's use Chrome's DevTools</span> <span data-start="913900">to go under the covers of Squoosh for a moment</span> <span data-start="916060">and take a look.</span> <span data-start="917500">Here on the screen, we can see different browser processes</span> <span data-start="920650">at work in the app.</span> <span data-start="922250">And if we zoom in to three of them — </span> <span data-start="924370">the main process and the workers — </span> <span data-start="926710">we can see, in the main process, all these vertical lines.</span> <span data-start="930600">And each vertical line indicates when the main thread's busy,</span> <span data-start="933620">and the app can't respond to user input.</span> <span data-start="935960">And you can see here they're all generally pretty narrow.</span> <span data-start="938801">And then you can see in the workers,</span> <span data-start="940300">we have these really long bars, representing these long running</span> <span data-start="943270">tasks that would jank the snot out of the UI</span> <span data-start="948580">if they weren't in the background.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="950040"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: Now if Jake can get his nerves back,</span> <span data-start="951760">he and Mariko are going to join us later and do</span> <span data-start="953770">a session on how they're able to build this application.</span> <span data-start="957892">So sometimes there are tasks that you can't naturally</span> <span data-start="960100">move off of the main thread, such as code</span> <span data-start="961870">that updates the UI.</span> <span data-start="963730">With the recently released Offscreen Canvas feature,</span> <span data-start="967090">now in Chrome and behind a flag in Firefox and Opera,</span> <span data-start="970450">helps you by letting you paint to image surfaces like Canvas</span> <span data-start="973510">and WebGL in a worker, and then copy the image buffer back</span> <span data-start="977470">over to the UI in a single, fast operation.</span> <span data-start="981960">The video here shows how Offscreen Canvas maintains</span> <span data-start="984630">a smooth UI even after we artificially add code</span> <span data-start="988200">to make the painting process expensive using that jank</span> <span data-start="991170">bottom in the middle.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="992154"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: It's pretty smooth.</span> <span data-start="996126">Tomorrow, we're going to tell you</span> <span data-start="997500">about more features that are coming to the web</span> <span data-start="999840">to help with smooth, buttery UIs, such as new APIs</span> <span data-start="1004790">for background code, called worklets that make tasks</span> <span data-start="1007730">like animation, audio, custom painting, and custom layout</span> <span data-start="1010880">easier; a new web component called a Virtual Scroller that</span> <span data-start="1014780">makes it easy to develop really smooth scrolling</span> <span data-start="1018230">views over large datasets; and a Task Scheduler API that</span> <span data-start="1022430">gives developers more control over how the browser spends</span> <span data-start="1025099">its time.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1025794"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: That's a lot, but as Mariko said,</span> <span data-start="1027710">you can never add enough butter.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1031089"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: So having a fast-loading, responsive</span> <span data-start="1033130">website is key, but so are the things that it actually does.</span> <span data-start="1037047">So on that note, let's talk about some</span> <span data-start="1038630">of the web's latest integrations with the underlying device</span> <span data-start="1041400">and operating system.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1043290"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: Let's take the Spotify PWA as an example.</span> <span data-start="1046310">With it, users can go straight from a link right into Spotify</span> <span data-start="1049640">without even installing anything.</span> <span data-start="1051220">And with the web's full support for background audio, DRM,</span> <span data-start="1054400">and offline, Spotify can provide a full-featured web experience.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1060020"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: And now Chrome supports desktop PWAs,</span> <span data-start="1062630">letting apps like Spotify run in their own windows</span> <span data-start="1065420">and be easily installed on Chrome OS, Windows, Linux,</span> <span data-start="1069560">and soon on the Mac.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1071355"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: I think desktop PWAs are really handy when</span> <span data-start="1073730">you've got lots of tabs open —  like Dion,</span> <span data-start="1075438">as I mentioned earlier — </span> <span data-start="1076784">and you want to keep your favorite stuff really easy</span> <span data-start="1078950">to get to, like with the Twitter PWA</span> <span data-start="1081137">that we're showing here running as a desktop</span> <span data-start="1082970">PWA in Chrome Canary on the Mac.</span> <span data-start="1085770">And what's really cool about Twitter</span> <span data-start="1087470">is that they've got experimental support that</span> <span data-start="1090050">enables their mobile PWA to run at desktop screen sizes,</span> <span data-start="1093980">as we're showing here, which has kind of been the dream of web</span> <span data-start="1097760">development for a long time.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1100006"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: While we're on the topic of desktop web apps,</span> <span data-start="1103010">we also recently implemented new web APIs</span> <span data-start="1105200">in Chrome that enable unfettered access to input devices.</span> <span data-start="1109800">So web apps can receive full keyboard input elements,</span> <span data-start="1113690">sample games' pads at high resolution,</span> <span data-start="1116240">and enter immersive fullscreen modes.</span> <span data-start="1118670">All of this is perfect for apps like</span> <span data-start="1120200">the recently-announced Google Project Stream shown here.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1123595"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: Speaking of media,</span> <span data-start="1124970">we've also taken the recently-released</span> <span data-start="1126830">picture-in-picture feature that we</span> <span data-start="1128660">have on mobile video over to the desktop, which</span> <span data-start="1131660">makes web video on desktop more of an integrated experience.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1135716"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: And then another important new web API</span> <span data-start="1137840">is WebAuthN, which enables websites to integrate</span> <span data-start="1140900">with biometric sensors and other forms</span> <span data-start="1143420">of multi-factor authentication.</span> <span data-start="1145400">It's currently implemented in Firefox, Opera, Chrome,</span> <span data-start="1148220">coming soon to Edge, and it can make web checkout</span> <span data-start="1150760">a seamlessly secure experience.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1211482"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: Now as the web evolves</span> <span data-start="1212940">and we get new capabilities, we're</span> <span data-start="1214356">constantly focused on interoperability,</span> <span data-start="1216660">on how well web apps work across browsers.</span> <span data-start="1219620">And we know this topic is top of mind with developers, too.</span> <span data-start="1223540">To this end, we've been collaborating</span> <span data-start="1225470">with other browsers on an open source comprehensive web</span> <span data-start="1228590">platform test project.</span> <span data-start="1230570">And we're pleased to share that the browsers are becoming</span> <span data-start="1237790">more interoperable as measured by these tests,</span> <span data-start="1241672">and we're continuing to collaborate</span> <span data-start="1243130">with the other browsers on reference docs</span> <span data-start="1244840">for the web on the Mozilla develop network.</span> </section>

this first tool here is the Guides tool.</span> <span data-start="1441830">Have you ever held a piece of paper up to your screen</span> <span data-start="1444038">and been like, ooh, is it lined up?</span> <span data-start="1446740">Here you go.</span> <span data-start="1447442">There's even, I think, a Chrome extension</span> <span data-start="1449150">that just does this one thing.</span> <span data-start="1450620">And so you can come down here, you're like,</span> <span data-start="1451580">oh that footer, that looks generally aligned.</span> <span data-start="1453670">Yeah, let me just kind of hover —  yep,</span> <span data-start="1455400">yeah, it looks great.</span> <span data-start="1456934">This is kind of interesting.</span> <span data-start="1458100">Look, I can go into a nested hover state,</span> <span data-start="1459808">and still check what's going on there.</span> <span data-start="1461532">So that's just the Grid tool.</span> <span data-start="1462740">There's a whole bunch of tools.</span> <span data-start="1463580">I'm to do my best to show you more what's going on here.</span> <span data-start="1465913">This is the Accessibility tool.</span> <span data-start="1467429">I really want Accessibility to be something</span> <span data-start="1469220">that more people are aware of.</span> <span data-start="1470480">It's a little —  there's just too many steps</span> <span data-start="1472460">to find what is there.</span> <span data-start="1473810">So this, you just hover now.</span> <span data-start="1475370">You just hover for color contrasts.</span> <span data-start="1476990">You hover for surfacing ARIA rules and tap indexes.</span> <span data-start="1480064">So basically, the things that you're generally looking for</span> <span data-start="1482480">are now a hover away instead of maybe it's five or six clicks.</span> <span data-start="1486080">And the same sort of thing is for styles.</span> <span data-start="1489080">So you can hover over SVG.</span> <span data-start="1490250">You can hover over buttons.</span> <span data-start="1491480">Nothing is off-limits to Pixelbug.</span> <span data-start="1493460">It's kind of punk rock.</span> <span data-start="1496520">It's like, hey, is there DOM there?</span> <span data-start="1498190">I'll look at it.</span> <span data-start="1498980">I'll tell you what's there.</span> <span data-start="1500710">And so here's what you — </span> <span data-start="1501755">and so let me go through a couple more tools.</span> <span data-start="1503630">I really like the hue shift tool.</span> <span data-start="1505400">And so if you go download this Chrome extension,</span> <span data-start="1507410">you just have to hover over a tool</span> <span data-start="1508730">and it will show you how it's used.</span> <span data-start="1509680">I'll do my best to walk through the keyboard shortcuts</span> <span data-start="1512360">that I'm doing.</span> <span data-start="1513030">But it's kind of like design vim at the moment.</span> <span data-start="1515470">Anyway, it's super fun.</span> <span data-start="1516909">So what I'm going to do, I'm going to select this path.</span> <span data-start="1519200">I want to make sure I've got my hue shift tool</span> <span data-start="1521140">I'm going hit Command-E to expand my selection.</span> <span data-start="1523160">I'm just going to hold it.</span> <span data-start="1524243">Whee.</span> <span data-start="1525020">And look at that.</span> <span data-start="1525740">So I selected all of those path nodes.</span> <span data-start="1527540">So the way that worked is it expanded</span> <span data-start="1529160">based on the node name and the class name,</span> <span data-start="1530930">and found similar elements that were siblings.</span> <span data-start="1533180">And I'm just going to add some black here.</span> <span data-start="1535980">Is that magical.</span> <span data-start="1536880">It feels magical.</span> <span data-start="1538020">If I hold Control, I can make my selections go away.</span> <span data-start="1540340">So I could be like, ooh, don't you like it?</span> <span data-start="1542280">And in this case, I think black's wrong.</span> <span data-start="1543510">I'm going to add some white.</span> <span data-start="1544676">I'm going to hit Shift and Right to add some hue.</span> <span data-start="1546790">And then I'm going to rotate the hue</span> <span data-start="1548040">with Command-Shift and Down.</span> <span data-start="1549206">So I'm rotating the hue by values of 10.</span> <span data-start="1551830">And now I can explore color palettes.</span> <span data-start="1554010">I love this particular tool.</span> <span data-start="1556380">It's HSL-based.</span> <span data-start="1557970">It's awesome.</span> <span data-start="1558720">So another thing I want to show you really quick too</span> <span data-start="1560070">is the Move tool.</span> <span data-start="1561309">You can just move things in the DOM around.</span> <span data-start="1563100">You click stuff, and you move it with the keyboard.</span> <span data-start="1565440">Duh, right?</span> <span data-start="1567080">Why haven't you had this before?</span> <span data-start="1568419">It seems to make so much sense.</span> <span data-start="1569710">So I'm just going to kind of rearrange it here a little bit.</span> <span data-start="1571230">I'm going to hit M for margin, and then I hit Shift-Up.</span> <span data-start="1574290">So Shift-Up, Shift-Up, Shift-Up.</span> <span data-start="1576720">I'm just adding 10 pixels of margin to the top.</span> <span data-start="1579240">So consider that these little quick tasks were things</span> <span data-start="1581700">that you had to sort of nest and find,</span> <span data-start="1583440">and now you can do them in the chaos</span> <span data-start="1585240">of the browser in production.</span> <span data-start="1587310">I wanted the DOM to be the source of truth.</span> <span data-start="1590022">I wanted a design tool that treated</span> <span data-start="1591480">the DOM as a source of truth.</span> <span data-start="1593130">Anyway, I like this site because it's like, ooh, super-flashy,</span> <span data-start="1596920">and this tool doesn't care.</span> <span data-start="1598650">Let's get a little meta, and take a quick look at Squoosh,</span> <span data-start="1602337">which was just introduced.</span> <span data-start="1603420">It's super-rad.</span> <span data-start="1605190">And the first thing I want to do is</span> <span data-start="1606911">talk about some of the additional tools in here.</span> <span data-start="1608910">But I want to troll Jake a little bit while I'm up here.</span> <span data-start="1612500">So what I'm going to do first, I'm going to grab this image,</span> <span data-start="1615000">and I'm going to turn it into myself.</span> <span data-start="1616950">So have you ever wanted to just swap</span> <span data-start="1619065">a pinned image on a web page?</span> <span data-start="1621730">It's just drag and drop, right?</span> <span data-start="1623970">Why hasn't that been there?</span> <span data-start="1625600">A lot of the stuff, I had to — </span> <span data-start="1626850">here's another one, Double-Click for text editing.</span> <span data-start="1629970">Let's just make this drag and plop — </span> <span data-start="1633570">because again, I'm trolling him.</span> <span data-start="1635430">We'll go back here to my little inspect tool</span> <span data-start="1637584">we'll look at what styles he's got in here.</span> <span data-start="1639375">Ooh, nice.</span> <span data-start="1639740">Some good Flexbox.</span> <span data-start="1640540">So I'm going to select this image.</span> <span data-start="1641430">I'm going to hit Command-E again.</span> <span data-start="1642840">Here's a fun idea I borrowed from XD.</span> <span data-start="1645400">So I'm very inspired from XD, and Figma, and Zeppelin,</span> <span data-start="1649080">and even Developer Tooling, too.</span> <span data-start="1650580">So watch this one.</span> <span data-start="1651370">I love this one.</span> <span data-start="1652210">I'm going to go in here.</span> <span data-start="1653210">I'm going to grab two images.</span> <span data-start="1654680">I want to grab a picture of me.</span> <span data-start="1657700">I wish I had other pictures.</span> <span data-start="1659204">Who wants to see my face multiple times?</span> <span data-start="1660870">Anyway, I want to drag in two images.</span> <span data-start="1662770">And if you remember we had — </span> <span data-start="1664482">oh, hey, come on.</span> <span data-start="1665190">Take focus, take focus, take focus.</span> <span data-start="1669730">Oh, good.</span> <span data-start="1670230">I was just impatient.</span> <span data-start="1671250">Here you go.</span> <span data-start="1671750">And I'm going to hover there.</span> <span data-start="1672300">Boom, they ping-pong.</span> <span data-start="1673320">[LAUGHTER]</span> <span data-start="1674884">It just sort of was like, hey, how many?</span> <span data-start="1676550">I don't care.</span> <span data-start="1677190">And it will just fill it up.</span> <span data-start="1678000">It's super-fun.</span> <span data-start="1678751">OK, so we're done kind of like trolling his home page.</span> <span data-start="1681000">Let's actually go do something meaningful.</span> <span data-start="1682749">He asked me to do a design review.</span> <span data-start="1684300">OK, so I hid my tools.</span> <span data-start="1685650">The site doesn't even know I changed it.</span> <span data-start="1688050">Let's drag in something fun.</span> <span data-start="1691110">I like this Christmas eggnog picture.</span> <span data-start="1693180">Yeah, this is good.</span> <span data-start="1694220">Me and my wife — </span> <span data-start="1695550">hello.</span> <span data-start="1697200">And so we have this very complex website.</span> <span data-start="1699720">It's packed with Wasm.</span> <span data-start="1701526">And you know, maybe conceptually, you're just like,</span> <span data-start="1703650">there's no way I could kind of help design that.</span> <span data-start="1705662">Well of course you can.</span> <span data-start="1706620">It's [INAUDIBLE].</span> <span data-start="1707328">It doesn't care.</span> <span data-start="1708147">So I'm going to expand it.</span> <span data-start="1709230">I'm going to get some things into a nested state, something</span> <span data-start="1711930">that's theoretically harder to design with.</span> <span data-start="1714190">And I'm going to darken this side up.</span> <span data-start="1716100">I'm a fan of retro wave right now.</span> <span data-start="1718390">And I love those like purples, pinks, and stuff on dark.</span> <span data-start="1720840">Let's do that to the site really quick.</span> <span data-start="1723140">So I'm going to launch [INAUDIBLE],,</span> <span data-start="1724640">and we're just going to use a couple of features here.</span> <span data-start="1726060">So I'm going to hit this header because I</span> <span data-start="1727620">think these need to be a little bit more</span> <span data-start="1728700">pronounced with some accent color.</span> <span data-start="1730116">I'm going to expand my selection by clicking a class name.</span> <span data-start="1732900">So what's cool is BEM and just dynamically generated</span> <span data-start="1735090">class names.</span> <span data-start="1735600">What they do is they create a consistency</span> <span data-start="1737550">between related nodes.</span> <span data-start="1738690">And so I leveraged those.</span> <span data-start="1740037">You just make a selection.</span> <span data-start="1741120">And you can hover on the classes too,</span> <span data-start="1742852">and it will pseudo-highlight.</span> <span data-start="1744060">Anyway, this tool is so full of features.</span> <span data-start="1746580">I'm having a hard time talking slow.</span> <span data-start="1748360">OK, so anyway I got these headers.</span> <span data-start="1750750">I just want to spoof these up.</span> <span data-start="1752340">So I'm going to get rid of their opacity</span> <span data-start="1753540">by doing Command-Shift Right and Left.</span> <span data-start="1755200">You can manage opacity.</span> <span data-start="1756390">I'm going to add some white by hitting Shift-Up.</span> <span data-start="1758560">I'm going to add some hue by adding Shift-Right.</span> <span data-start="1761190">And I'm going to change the hue to (SINGING) hot pink.</span> <span data-start="1764801">Right?</span> <span data-start="1765300">Super-rad.</span> <span data-start="1765950">OK, so then I'm going to go in here.</span> <span data-start="1767580">And I'm going to darken this up.</span> <span data-start="1769087">I like how transparent it is, but I've</span> <span data-start="1770670">got this darkness vibe.</span> <span data-start="1772970">I just —  dark.</span> <span data-start="1774760">So let's darken it up, right?</span> <span data-start="1776160">OK, and we'll come down here.</span> <span data-start="1777650">And you know, this should look like magic right now.</span> <span data-start="1780652">So I'm just doing Shift-Down.</span> <span data-start="1781860">I'm just adding black.</span> <span data-start="1782970">Now this particular node, he's a little tricky.</span> <span data-start="1784928">Look, he's a number input.</span> <span data-start="1786090">So you can navigate the entire DOM with your keyboard.</span> <span data-start="1789530">So I'm going to hit tab.</span> <span data-start="1790710">It just tabbed me to the next child.</span> <span data-start="1792420">Hit Shift-Down.</span> <span data-start="1793140">I'm going to black that out.</span> <span data-start="1794625">Mm-hmm, that's fine.</span> <span data-start="1795565">Then we'll grab this, and I'm just going to black that out.</span> <span data-start="1798780">And we'll get rid of the tool.</span> <span data-start="1801370">And I will send a screenshot to Jake,</span> <span data-start="1803030">and be like, this is how it should look, dude.</span> <span data-start="1804946">It should be pink and blue.</span> <span data-start="1807219">Come see me in the forum.</span> <span data-start="1808260">I've got more stuff to show you.</span> <span data-start="1809610">I mean, there is —  like, it's weird.</span> <span data-start="1811300">It does a lot of weird stuff.</span> <span data-start="1812560">And it's really fun.</span> <span data-start="1814350">Nothing is off-limits to this tool.</span> <span data-start="1816250">And I hope content writers, web designers, just people finally</span> <span data-start="1820080">have a tool that helps empower them in the DOM.</span> <span data-start="1822239">It should feel like a document.</span> <span data-start="1823530">It should feel like an artboard.</span> <span data-start="1824550">That's the illusion I'm trying to go for.</span> <span data-start="1825750">So — </span> </section>
