<section><span data-start="6639"><span class="speaker">Aanchal Bahadur</span>: Hi, everyone, I'm Aanchal.</span> <span data-start="8430">And I work on product partnerships for Chrome.</span> <span data-start="11130">My job is to evangelize the web to all of you</span> <span data-start="13620">and be an advocate for your feedback</span> <span data-start="16320">as Chrome continues to build exciting new things that you</span> <span data-start="19200">just heard about from Ben and [? Dion. ?]</span> <span data-start="21990">Sure, I play that role.</span> <span data-start="24430">But if you look harder, I really am the unicorn that all tech</span> <span data-start="28350">companies are looking to solve.</span> <span data-start="31090">I'm a millennial.</span> <span data-start="32549">Happy being friends with my phone, my laptop,</span> <span data-start="35760">my noise cancellation headphones, Fitbit, Kindle — </span> <span data-start="39360">you name it.</span> <span data-start="40960">So in this particular instance, I went on a vacation,</span> <span data-start="44310">unlike millennials, with my mom.</span> <span data-start="48150">I grew up in India, and I go back three times a year</span> <span data-start="51210">to visit my dog, Rafiki.</span> <span data-start="53520">And my family is usually there too.</span> <span data-start="56460">And he usually needs to be held that way 24 hours a day.</span> <span data-start="59670">And so someone needs to stay back —  had to be my father.</span> <span data-start="63330">And so my mother and I drove up to the hills of Landour.</span> <span data-start="67140">I know it sounds like a location from the "Lord of the Rings,"</span> <span data-start="70170">but it actually is a town in Northern India.</span> <span data-start="73320">And it's famous for great weather, good desserts,</span> <span data-start="76950">and after this talk, for network connections.</span> <span data-start="81940">So quick show of hands, how many of you</span> <span data-start="83880">have experienced coffee shop Wi-Fi?</span> <span data-start="88140">Expected.</span> <span data-start="89190">I, for on —  always looking for that perfect spot</span> <span data-start="91530">on a couch in a coffee shop solving the world's problems</span> <span data-start="94080">on my laptop.</span> <span data-start="95920">How about airplane Wi-Fi?</span> <span data-start="100080">Wow, quite a few of you.</span> <span data-start="101220">But yeah, definitely more frustrating than coffee shop</span> <span data-start="103920">or conference Wi-Fi.</span> <span data-start="106740">What about instances when you've paid for Wi-Fi,</span> <span data-start="109660">and you've got no Wi-Fi?</span> <span data-start="111630">Seemed like the entire population of Landour</span> <span data-start="114240">was either on 2G or largely offline</span> <span data-start="118350">or, like me, pointing my phone at network</span> <span data-start="120210">towers demanding the internet like it's my human right.</span> <span data-start="125430">Even in an offline situation, the web came to my rescue.</span> <span data-start="129050">I had offlined a few articles on the best bakeries in Landour,</span> <span data-start="132400">how to find more food in Landour,</span> <span data-start="134910">and the web came to my rescue there.</span> <span data-start="137400">So this map from the Chrome User Experience Report</span> <span data-start="140430">shows you 4G densities across the world.</span> <span data-start="143560">And it looks like in the US and some parts</span> <span data-start="147060">where it's dark green is really good.</span> <span data-start="149590">But think about the last time you were on your commute,</span> <span data-start="151980">in the BART, or anywhere, on the train, reliable, fast 4G</span> <span data-start="156300">is still a privilege.</span> <span data-start="158150">And this isn't really a US or an emerging-market story.</span> <span data-start="162120">The web needs to work for everyone at any time</span> <span data-start="165720">everywhere.</span> <span data-start="169010">These instant-loading experiences for everyone</span> <span data-start="171690">make the web like that crucial friend</span> <span data-start="173870">who's actually there for you when you need them the most.</span> <span data-start="178070">But historically, despite its reach,</span> <span data-start="180480">the web has not met user expectations</span> <span data-start="182490">when it comes to mobile.</span> <span data-start="184290">A lot of you are changing that narrative,</span> <span data-start="186080">are shaping it real-time —  adoption of new web</span> <span data-start="189090">technologies like Service Worker are playing</span> <span data-start="191520">a role in changing this.</span> <span data-start="194100">Investment in web performance literally pays off.</span> <span data-start="197520">These companies across the world have</span> <span data-start="199650">been investing in web performance</span> <span data-start="201300">and have actually seen business impact.</span> <span data-start="203650">LinkedIn Lite saw four times increase in job applications</span> <span data-start="207330">by just building a progressive web</span> <span data-start="208800">map using caching strategies.</span> <span data-start="211120">Wayfair, like you just recently heard from Ben and Dion,</span> <span data-start="214050">have also seen 10% conversion increase.</span> <span data-start="216920">And ClickBus in Brazil is also seeing sales go up.</span> <span data-start="220350">So it literally pays off.</span> <span data-start="222720">So I looked for that exact point of intersection that lights up</span> <span data-start="225630">a millennial's brain and makes them really happy.</span> <span data-start="229426">And I realized that it pretty much comes down</span> <span data-start="231300">to music, coffee, and photos.</span> <span data-start="235240">Music on Spotify, coffee from Starbucks,</span> <span data-start="239190">and photos of the latest fashion trends or whatever —  dogs,</span> <span data-start="242490">if you're me — </span> <span data-start="243210">on Pinterest.</span> <span data-start="245100">I still remember my first few conversations</span> <span data-start="247020">with these companies.</span> <span data-start="248340">And the people that I actually spoke to</span> <span data-start="250380">are here today to tell you the valuable lessons they</span> <span data-start="253050">learned building on the web.</span> <span data-start="254880">It hasn't been easy.</span> <span data-start="256140">It's taken months and months of testing — </span> <span data-start="258570">some failures, some learnings, but ultimately, they've</span> <span data-start="261420">all seen business impact.</span> <span data-start="262650">And we're glad they're here to share it with you.</span> <span data-start="264750">So without further ado, please join me</span> <span data-start="266460">in welcoming Rizzo from Spotify.</span> <span data-start="268050">[APPLAUSE]</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="271357"><span class="speaker">Matt Rizzo</span>: Thanks, Aanchal.</span> <span data-start="272523">[MUSIC PLAYING]</span> <span data-start="279000">Last year, Spotify had a burning question.</span> <span data-start="282880">Would having a mobile web music player allow us to grow faster?</span> <span data-start="287170">Today I have the answer, and I'm here to share it with you.</span> <span data-start="291340">I'm Matt Rizzo, and I'm a product manager</span> <span data-start="293170">at the growth team at Spotify.</span> <span data-start="295360">As a growth team, our goal is to drive sustained growth</span> <span data-start="298330">of users around the world.</span> <span data-start="300650">Within this greater growth team, my team's specific focus</span> <span data-start="303790">is on using the web to capture and validate</span> <span data-start="306580">growth opportunities.</span> <span data-start="308680">Over the next few minutes, I'll share with you</span> <span data-start="311350">how we decided if we should invest in the mobile web</span> <span data-start="314740">and where we are today.</span> <span data-start="316880">So let me take you back to 2017.</span> <span data-start="319300">At this time, there was no way to listen to Spotify</span> <span data-start="321820">on mobile web.</span> <span data-start="323320">We already had a robust web experience on desktop</span> <span data-start="326260">that was working on Windows, Chrome OS, and Mac OS.</span> <span data-start="330760">But on mobile, we had no such option.</span> <span data-start="333350">And frankly, we were unsure if we should.</span> <span data-start="336460">Things seemed pretty good for us.</span> <span data-start="338340">We had been growing fast.</span> <span data-start="339640">And our native apps had impressive retention figures.</span> <span data-start="343430">But every day, millions of people</span> <span data-start="345740">visited our artist, album, and playlist links on the web.</span> <span data-start="349340">And we're hit with a wall.</span> <span data-start="350960">Each one of those users had to download the Spotify</span> <span data-start="353660">app to listen to music.</span> <span data-start="355670">Our hunch was that this hard-download wall was</span> <span data-start="358130">hurting our ability to grow.</span> <span data-start="359776">In fact, it was turning users away from Spotify.</span> <span data-start="364940">So to explore this question in more depth,</span> <span data-start="367130">we headed to Brazil.</span> <span data-start="369260">Why Brazil?</span> <span data-start="370790">Well, we saw two things that were important to us.</span> <span data-start="373160">One, we had a ton of web traffic from Brazil.</span> <span data-start="376200">It was a growth market for us.</span> <span data-start="377791">And — </span> <span data-start="378290">[TELEPHONE RINGING]</span> <span data-start="379290">Hey.</span> <span data-start="382610">And a significant amount of our users in Brazil</span> <span data-start="385040">had less than a gigabyte of storage space on their phone.</span> <span data-start="388520">This left these users in a constant state</span> <span data-start="390410">of prioritization.</span> <span data-start="391640">Should I keep this app on my phone?</span> <span data-start="394070">Or should I delete it to make way</span> <span data-start="395840">for this app I really need right now?</span> <span data-start="399120">So after talking to more users in Brazil,</span> <span data-start="401180">we realized this was a real challenge,</span> <span data-start="403160">and it was affecting us.</span> <span data-start="404960">This challenge caused people to either delete Spotify</span> <span data-start="407720">or to not download it in the first place,</span> <span data-start="410510">effectively, making it impossible</span> <span data-start="412310">for them to use Spotify on their phone.</span> <span data-start="416067">We also learned that there was another type of user that</span> <span data-start="418400">could benefit from Spotify — </span> <span data-start="421040">those who were unfamiliar with Spotify.</span> <span data-start="423890">Imagine you've never heard of Spotify,</span> <span data-start="425960">and you get a link sent to you from one of your friends.</span> <span data-start="429110">You click that link to listen to a song.</span> <span data-start="431510">And you end up on a page.</span> <span data-start="433380">This page prompts you to download an app.</span> <span data-start="436430">Downloading an app is a tall order for you</span> <span data-start="438490">if you've never even heard of Spotify.</span> <span data-start="440390">Why should I download this?</span> <span data-start="441710">I just want to hear this one song.</span> <span data-start="444900">So because of these insights, we had a strong perspective</span> <span data-start="448590">that we should have a mobile web experience.</span> <span data-start="451200">And there were two users that we thought we needed it for.</span> <span data-start="454080">The first is people with low storage space</span> <span data-start="456150">who can't download our app.</span> <span data-start="457597">And the second is people who don't know Spotify</span> <span data-start="459555">and are not familiar enough to actually decide</span> <span data-start="462300">to download Spotify.</span> <span data-start="463980">So we started experimenting.</span> <span data-start="466110">We started experimenting to test our belief that the mobile web</span> <span data-start="468990">would unlock growth.</span> <span data-start="471370">We started really small.</span> <span data-start="473430">Our first tests were fast and simple.</span> <span data-start="476070">What if we gave our existing traffic, a limited player</span> <span data-start="479340">from which they could play just one song, before downloading</span> <span data-start="482220">the app?</span> <span data-start="483962">Guess what happened when we launched this test.</span> <span data-start="489730">We saw first-day plays increase by 25%.</span> <span data-start="493150">This was huge.</span> <span data-start="494320">That was the number of users who play within 24</span> <span data-start="496600">hours of visiting our site.</span> <span data-start="498550">After seeing this, we knew there was enormous demand</span> <span data-start="501190">for a mobile web player.</span> <span data-start="503260">So we took the next step.</span> <span data-start="505840">Now that we had strong data to back up our intuition,</span> <span data-start="509090">we went a step further.</span> <span data-start="510740">We wanted to test two universes against each other,</span> <span data-start="513669">one universe in which we had a mobile web player and then one</span> <span data-start="518140">in which we didn't.</span> <span data-start="519610">We wanted to do this because we wanted</span> <span data-start="521200">to understand if there would be an incremental benefit to us</span> <span data-start="524350">going in and investing in the web.</span> <span data-start="526520">So we built a full experience.</span> <span data-start="528659">And this full experience would allow for more immersive</span> <span data-start="530950">sessions on the web.</span> <span data-start="532210">And then we exposed it to 50% of our visitors.</span> <span data-start="537070">This experience included three key Chrome features.</span> <span data-start="540350">First, the media session API, and this allowed users</span> <span data-start="543910">to control playback from the notification tray;</span> <span data-start="547030">second, PWA install for Quick Access from the home screen;</span> <span data-start="551780">and finally, we had protected content support</span> <span data-start="554710">to ensure artists were guarded from piracy.</span> <span data-start="558496">Guess what we saw from this test.</span> <span data-start="564060">We saw a 54% increase in day-one plays,</span> <span data-start="567540">and even a sustained 14% increase in active users all</span> <span data-start="571260">the way through to day 60 — </span> <span data-start="572910">so real retention.</span> <span data-start="574870">We also learned about the power of the web</span> <span data-start="576660">as a reactivation driver.</span> <span data-start="578820">So 30% of the logins we were seeing</span> <span data-start="581250">were coming from users who had not been active</span> <span data-start="583560">in the past 28 days.</span> <span data-start="585480">Our mobile web player was bringing churned users back</span> <span data-start="588291">onto the platform.</span> <span data-start="591780">We had one concern though.</span> <span data-start="593550">And our concern was that launching a mobile web</span> <span data-start="595530">experience would actually cannibalize our app downloads</span> <span data-start="598680">and hurt those impressive retention figures I referenced.</span> <span data-start="601980">But we've seen the opposite.</span> <span data-start="604530">When people have access to a robust web experience,</span> <span data-start="607680">they're actually more likely to download the Spotify app.</span> <span data-start="612850">So to summarize, we had a hunch that the app download barrier</span> <span data-start="616500">was turning users away from Spotify</span> <span data-start="618840">and hurting our growth potential.</span> <span data-start="620970">By building a web experience, we made</span> <span data-start="623070">Spotify accessible to more users and have seen sustained growth</span> <span data-start="626820">on both the web and in our native apps.</span> <span data-start="630180">If you are on the fence about investing in web,</span> <span data-start="632970">I would start by understanding what barriers are keeping you</span> <span data-start="635790">from reaching your customers.</span> <span data-start="638430">After you've done that, then start</span> <span data-start="640110">understanding how the web can remove those barriers.</span> <span data-start="643530">And finally, start with small tests</span> <span data-start="645600">to validate your hypothesis that the web can unlock growth.</span> <span data-start="649150">Just like Spotify, you might find</span> <span data-start="651090">that the web is a powerful way to reach your goals.</span> <span data-start="654630">Now, I'm going to turn it over to David</span> <span data-start="656460">to talk about how Starbucks meets their customers where</span> <span data-start="659400">they are — </span> <span data-start="660240">on the web.</span> <span data-start="662157">[APPLAUSE]</span> <span data-start="664113">Good luck, man.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="665091"><span class="speaker">David Brunelle</span>: Thank you.</span> <span data-start="666174">[MUSIC PLAYING]</span> <span data-start="670470">Good morning.</span> <span data-start="671800">My name is David Bernelle.</span> <span data-start="673050">And my team builds the digital product</span> <span data-start="675300">used by Starbucks customers in the US</span> <span data-start="677730">in a number of international markets.</span> <span data-start="679680">And our job is to extend the Starbucks experience</span> <span data-start="682380">beyond the four walls of our stores to the devices</span> <span data-start="685290">that our customers have in their hands.</span> <span data-start="688080">In early 2017, we asked ourselves,</span> <span data-start="690940">how can we use the web to give our customers the best</span> <span data-start="693570">experience possible?</span> <span data-start="695460">That question led us to launch a PWA later that year.</span> <span data-start="699320">And I'm excited to share some more of that story with you — </span> <span data-start="701910">the why, the how, and some of what we've learned so far.</span> <span data-start="706890">Before we started, we knew a few things.</span> <span data-start="709480">First, millions of customers were using our native apps</span> <span data-start="712370">every day to order ahead and pay in our stores.</span> <span data-start="716010">Second, the Starbucks native apps</span> <span data-start="718170">had a higher number of daily active users than our website.</span> <span data-start="721650">But third, the Starbucks website had</span> <span data-start="724410">significantly more monthly active users</span> <span data-start="727080">than our native apps.</span> <span data-start="728880">In fact, our website was reaching 6 million</span> <span data-start="730950">more people every month than our IOS app.</span> <span data-start="735000">The opportunity for us was huge.</span> <span data-start="737190">If we could provide a better experience</span> <span data-start="739200">to these 6 million users, we believed</span> <span data-start="742080">they'd have a more meaningful interaction with Starbucks</span> <span data-start="744520">and that that would be great for our business.</span> <span data-start="746827">It was important for us to build a web</span> <span data-start="748410">app that was as full-featured and pleasant to use</span> <span data-start="751410">as our native apps.</span> <span data-start="752820">That meant that it had to be reliable, fast, and engaging.</span> <span data-start="758220">Our customers tend to use higher-end devices,</span> <span data-start="760830">but they experience a wide variety of network conditions.</span> <span data-start="764460">We have stores all over — </span> <span data-start="766140">suburban shopping centers, basements,</span> <span data-start="768450">and office buildings, and airports, for some examples.</span> <span data-start="772371">Customers at these stores might experience</span> <span data-start="774120">3G, unpredictable Wi-Fi like captive Wi-Fi portals,</span> <span data-start="778740">or have no connection at all.</span> <span data-start="780690">When a customer walks into any of these locations,</span> <span data-start="783660">they need to be able to open their app,</span> <span data-start="785430">scan their barcode to pay, and be on their way quickly.</span> <span data-start="789900">We addressed this by using some of the web platform's</span> <span data-start="792150">capabilities — </span> <span data-start="793620">JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and other static assets</span> <span data-start="797610">are cached locally.</span> <span data-start="798960">Don't pay too much attention to the code you see up on screen.</span> <span data-start="801956">It's there to illustrate just how little code is actually</span> <span data-start="804330">required to implement runtime caching and precaching</span> <span data-start="807840">thanks to Workbox.</span> <span data-start="809850">User-specific data is then encrypted and stored locally</span> <span data-start="813300">with IndexedDB.</span> <span data-start="815010">This means that, when a customer opens up the PWA,</span> <span data-start="817800">she can expect it to work.</span> <span data-start="821380">Customers need our PWA to be fast.</span> <span data-start="824020">No one wants to be standing in front of the barista waiting</span> <span data-start="826810">for their app to load while a line develops</span> <span data-start="829630">behind them, especially if you're</span> <span data-start="831430">a millennial like Aanchal.</span> <span data-start="834700">Some strategies that helped us make the PWA fast — </span> <span data-start="837790">webpack helps us keep our JavaScript bundle small.</span> <span data-start="840970">This means that devices only need to download and parse</span> <span data-start="844480">the code needed to power the experience</span> <span data-start="846760">they're trying to access.</span> <span data-start="848820">We use the Service Worker API and Workbox precache</span> <span data-start="852430">to download additional JavaScript in CSS</span> <span data-start="855010">before the user needs it.</span> <span data-start="857080">Our CDN dynamically optimizes images,</span> <span data-start="860530">serving the right size and the right format at the right time.</span> <span data-start="865190">These and other techniques mean that our PWA's initial time</span> <span data-start="869140">to interactive is two times faster than the web experiences</span> <span data-start="873220">it replaced.</span> <span data-start="874360">And subsequent page loads are lightning fast.</span> <span data-start="878230">Starbucks customers trust us to keep their personal information</span> <span data-start="881500">and payment data safe and secure.</span> <span data-start="883990">The Credential Management API gives us the ability</span> <span data-start="887710">to provide customers the opportunity</span> <span data-start="889420">to sign in using saved credentials,</span> <span data-start="892057">eliminating a lot of the friction associated</span> <span data-start="893890">with signing it.</span> <span data-start="895470">Today, 28% of customers using Chrome</span> <span data-start="898390">across mobile and desktop use the Credential Management API</span> <span data-start="901300">to authenticate.</span> <span data-start="904030">Using Add to Home screen, customers</span> <span data-start="906310">can quickly install the Starbucks PWA to their phone.</span> <span data-start="909940">Once on their home screen, it's indistinguishable</span> <span data-start="912130">from native apps.</span> <span data-start="913587">And paying for your order by scanning your barcode</span> <span data-start="915670">is only two taps away.</span> <span data-start="918870">And it's really a joy to use.</span> <span data-start="920720">Throughout the experience, we've added thoughtful animations</span> <span data-start="923720">and meaningful user feedback.</span> <span data-start="925790">The experience is compliant with web content accessibility</span> <span data-start="929240">guidelines.</span> <span data-start="930860">We use a pattern library to ensure consistency</span> <span data-start="933140">throughout the PWA and other web experiences at Starbucks.</span> <span data-start="938342">The pattern library is a collection</span> <span data-start="939800">of React UI components, shared styles,</span> <span data-start="942470">and commonly used utilities.</span> <span data-start="944570">Developers consume the pattern library via NPM.</span> <span data-start="947860">And we also expose it as a web app</span> <span data-start="949580">so developers can access documentation</span> <span data-start="952190">and so that folks from our design and product teams</span> <span data-start="955310">can access components and interact with them</span> <span data-start="957440">to see exactly how they'll behave in a browser.</span> <span data-start="961280">The great thing about building a PWA</span> <span data-start="963230">is that it runs in a wide variety of devices</span> <span data-start="965690">that might not be supported by our native apps</span> <span data-start="968510">like this commenter from Hacker News who</span> <span data-start="971210">was excited to discover that they had a Starbucks app that</span> <span data-start="973640">worked on their BlackBerry.</span> <span data-start="977610">We built our PWA to be mobile first.</span> <span data-start="980550">But because we built it to be responsive,</span> <span data-start="982500">it provides a great experience on desktop too.</span> <span data-start="985410">And we've discovered that customers love to order coffee</span> <span data-start="987780">from the desktop.</span> <span data-start="989010">In fact, 25% of our orders through the Starbucks PWA</span> <span data-start="992790">come from desktop browsers.</span> <span data-start="996510">In short, we've learned that customers love the Starbucks</span> <span data-start="999270">PWA, and it's been great for business.</span> <span data-start="1003200">Since we launched app.starbucks.com and created</span> <span data-start="1006050">an experience that's on par with that of our native apps,</span> <span data-start="1009020">the number of customers joining Starbucks rewards via the web</span> <span data-start="1012290">has increased by 65%.</span> <span data-start="1015270">So should you invest in the web?</span> <span data-start="1017490">Yeah, absolutely.</span> <span data-start="1019280">The web's reach is massive, and the barriers</span> <span data-start="1021620">to create a high-performing PWA are quite low.</span> <span data-start="1025280">You've heard it from Rizzo at Spotify,</span> <span data-start="1027140">now from me at Starbucks, that the results are real.</span> <span data-start="1030700">Now I'd like to introduce you to Zack from Pinterest</span> <span data-start="1033829">to tell you about how their team keeps their PWA fast.</span> <span data-start="1037490">[APPLAUSE]</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1046140"><span class="speaker">Zack Argyle</span>: Hi.</span> <span data-start="1047504">My name's Zach Argyle.</span> <span data-start="1048420">And I lead the web platform team at Pinterest.</span> <span data-start="1051360">About a year ago, we teamed up with the growth team</span> <span data-start="1054330">to rebuild Pinterest mobile web from scratch, but why?</span> <span data-start="1059790">Well, for one, our users did not like the current offering.</span> <span data-start="1065555">[LAUGHTER]</span> <span data-start="1068410">It hurts because it's so real.</span> <span data-start="1072810">So Stephanie, if you're watching,</span> <span data-start="1074910">my sincerest apologies.</span> <span data-start="1077760">At the time, our mobile website was essentially just an upsell</span> <span data-start="1080630">for our native app.</span> <span data-start="1082620">However, we noticed that the number</span> <span data-start="1084480">of users who actually downloaded the app compared</span> <span data-start="1086580">to the number that actually came to the mobile website</span> <span data-start="1089550">was very low.</span> <span data-start="1090730">And we knew we could do better.</span> <span data-start="1092700">So last year, we shipped a from-scratch rewrite</span> <span data-start="1095280">of the mobile website in just under three months.</span> <span data-start="1100460">It was four times faster to load for initial page loads</span> <span data-start="1104090">and almost six times faster on subsequent visits.</span> <span data-start="1106934">The initial JavaScript bundle size</span> <span data-start="1108350">decreased from 650 kilobytes to less than 200.</span> <span data-start="1112880">And our CSS payload decreased from 160 kilobytes</span> <span data-start="1117620">to 6 inlined into the app shell.</span> <span data-start="1121880">But what about now?</span> <span data-start="1123150">It's done.</span> <span data-start="1123650">We shipped.</span> <span data-start="1124150">It's over.</span> <span data-start="1125210">We can all go home.</span> <span data-start="1126620">We did our job.</span> <span data-start="1128010">Unfortunately, entropy is very real.</span> <span data-start="1131080">At Pinterest, we have over 100 engineers</span> <span data-start="1133070">committing to the web code base.</span> <span data-start="1135662">So we had to ask ourselves, what could we</span> <span data-start="1137370">do to make sure that this fast experience stayed fast</span> <span data-start="1140460">as time went by?</span> <span data-start="1142350">The answer was performance budgets.</span> <span data-start="1147970">At Pinterest, this breaks down into three sections — </span> <span data-start="1150870">logging, alerting, and prevention.</span> <span data-start="1154154">There's two main metrics that we look at</span> <span data-start="1155820">to ensure that the PWA stays fast.</span> <span data-start="1157790">And the first is JavaScript bundle size.</span> <span data-start="1162570">For logging, we wrote a webpack plugin</span> <span data-start="1165000">that reports development and production bundle sizes</span> <span data-start="1167820">to our internal logging system.</span> <span data-start="1169205">This gave us the ability to track bundle size changes</span> <span data-start="1171510">over time for all of our web applications.</span> <span data-start="1176260">And then, using those real-time metrics,</span> <span data-start="1178410">we built out dashboards with alerting</span> <span data-start="1180000">enabled to make sure that all of our core bundles stay small.</span> <span data-start="1184950">We know painfully, from experience,</span> <span data-start="1186810">that one of the main offenders of JavaScript bloat</span> <span data-start="1189840">is importing something with a large dependency tree.</span> <span data-start="1193350">A single line of code could add tens or hundreds of kilobytes</span> <span data-start="1197280">to your bundle.</span> <span data-start="1199280">So to help prevent this from happening in our monorepo,</span> <span data-start="1202250">we wrote an ESLint Plugin to disallow imports</span> <span data-start="1205220">from certain paths.</span> <span data-start="1206700">For example, our mobile web-only code base cannot import from</span> <span data-start="1209930">our desktop-only code base.</span> <span data-start="1214430">The other metric we care about is a composite performance</span> <span data-start="1217680">metric called Pinner Wait Time, or PWT.</span> <span data-start="1221280">It's a combination of time-to-interactive and image</span> <span data-start="1223410">load times.</span> <span data-start="1225120">When deciding what to measure, look</span> <span data-start="1226841">to what your users care about.</span> <span data-start="1228090">For us, that's images.</span> <span data-start="1231540">Until the above-the-fold images are loaded, to our users,</span> <span data-start="1234330">page load is not complete.</span> <span data-start="1235569">So that time-to-interactive was not enough.</span> <span data-start="1237360">So we created a custom metric specific</span> <span data-start="1239130">to our service and user expectations.</span> <span data-start="1241380">We also tracked more granular performance metrics,</span> <span data-start="1243599">like time-to-first-paint and time-to-interactive,</span> <span data-start="1245640">which are really helpful for debugging performance</span> <span data-start="1248310">regressions.</span> <span data-start="1250080">We also have client-side logging that includes browser, country,</span> <span data-start="1253350">user state, and many other fields</span> <span data-start="1255180">that are helpful for segmenting usage.</span> <span data-start="1257792">Again, we set up dashboards with alerting</span> <span data-start="1259500">enabled to make sure that all these [INAUDIBLE] pages stayed</span> <span data-start="1261999">fast.</span> <span data-start="1263370">We did notice that one of the main offenders of page load</span> <span data-start="1266040">regression was the hundreds of experiments</span> <span data-start="1268980">that we had running at any given time.</span> <span data-start="1271820">So we added performance regression information, front</span> <span data-start="1274120">and center in our experiment dashboard,</span> <span data-start="1276380">so the engineers could be aware of any performance impact</span> <span data-start="1279490">caused by their experiments.</span> <span data-start="1281890">This also means that you can see the performance</span> <span data-start="1284170">improvements of your experiment as well, which was really cool.</span> <span data-start="1288980">These are just a few examples of how we incorporated logging,</span> <span data-start="1291580">alerting, and prevention into our workflows</span> <span data-start="1293731">to ensure that progressive web apps stayed fast.</span> <span data-start="1295730">And we saw incredible results from building out</span> <span data-start="1298690">the experience.</span> <span data-start="1300890">Year over year on the mobile web,</span> <span data-start="1303050">we saw a 103% increase in weekly users, nearly 300%</span> <span data-start="1309200">increase in session length, and our mobile website</span> <span data-start="1313030">has since been our number one platform</span> <span data-start="1315940">for new user sign-ups surpassing Android, IOS, and desktop web.</span> <span data-start="1321030">You've seen it from David and Rizzo.</span> <span data-start="1322950">The future is truly in the browser.</span> <span data-start="1325170">And performance is the foundation of it all.</span> <span data-start="1327422">With these budgeting strategies in place,</span> <span data-start="1329130">we've continued to see incredible growth, especially</span> <span data-start="1331296">in emerging markets where bandwidth is limited</span> <span data-start="1333330">and low-end devices are common.</span> <span data-start="1335640">In some countries, a year after shipping our new experience,</span> <span data-start="1338790">weekly users had increased by over 300%.</span> <span data-start="1342570">And the number of pins seen had increased by over 600%.</span> <span data-start="1347810">For Pinterest, the number of pins seen</span> <span data-start="1349850">is directly correlated with our overall revenue.</span> <span data-start="1355720">Investing in improving and maintaining performance</span> <span data-start="1357910">has directly impacted the company's bottom line.</span> <span data-start="1361070">So if you, like Pinterest, care about an exceptional user</span> <span data-start="1365260">experience, regardless of device, network, or conditions,</span> <span data-start="1369670">build a progressive web app with performance as a priority.</span> <span data-start="1373160">If you'd like to read more about our one-year PWA retrospective,</span> <span data-start="1375940">use the short link on the slide to visit</span> <span data-start="1377980">"Pinterest Engineering" blog.</span> <span data-start="1379810">And with that, I'm happy to bring Aanchal back</span> <span data-start="1381970">on stage to share a quick recap for you all.</span> <span data-start="1384602">[APPLAUSE]</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1392160"><span class="speaker">Aanchal Bahadur</span>: All right, so it's day one.</span> <span data-start="1394380">It's just the first start of Chrome Dev Summit.</span> <span data-start="1396431">Can you please join me in giving a thunderous round of applause</span> <span data-start="1399055">to David, Zack, and Rizzo for summing up months</span> <span data-start="1402799">and months of hard work — </span> <span data-start="1403840">[APPLAUSE]</span> <span data-start="1405580">into just five minutes?</span> <span data-start="1409460">All right.</span> <span data-start="1410060">So if you remember what I said at the beginning,</span> <span data-start="1412590">you also know I have a very short attention span.</span> <span data-start="1415650">So I was backstage making notes.</span> <span data-start="1417180">I have three things to share with you.</span> <span data-start="1419001">This is the part of the job where</span> <span data-start="1420375">you remember to keep your phones out</span> <span data-start="1422210">to take photographs and screenshots if you're</span> <span data-start="1424130">watching us on video.</span> <span data-start="1425540">Very quickly —  three business wins from Pinterest, Starbucks,</span> <span data-start="1428900">and Spotify.</span> <span data-start="1430540">So if, like Spotify, you want to get more users,</span> <span data-start="1434000">remove friction.</span> <span data-start="1435380">It seems pretty obvious, but the results are real.</span> <span data-start="1438800">Run multiple tests.</span> <span data-start="1440000">Be convinced, just like they were.</span> <span data-start="1441770">Rizzo told me it took eight or nine tests for them to do this.</span> <span data-start="1445280">And the results —  an increase in activation,</span> <span data-start="1448070">54%, and retention, 14% increase in day-60 active users.</span> <span data-start="1455580">If, like Starbucks you want to meet your users</span> <span data-start="1458010">where they are — </span> <span data-start="1459120">airports, hostel rooms, tanking up on caffeine,</span> <span data-start="1462570">wherever they might be, be sure to be using Workbox caching</span> <span data-start="1466840">strategies.</span> <span data-start="1468040">And my favorite thing about their progressive web app</span> <span data-start="1470440">is the thoughtful animations that</span> <span data-start="1471910">pop up to make sure that my 100 different customizations</span> <span data-start="1475510">of my coffee are actually accurate.</span> <span data-start="1477670">It's fantastic.</span> <span data-start="1479170">65% increase in number of customers joining the Starbucks</span> <span data-start="1482380">Rewards program — </span> <span data-start="1484120">direct business impact.</span> <span data-start="1487230">And finally, if you want to set a standard for web performance,</span> <span data-start="1490950">be like Pinterest.</span> <span data-start="1492450">Focus on performance, focus on setting a performance budget — </span> <span data-start="1496310">600% increase in number of pins seen.</span> <span data-start="1499140">When Zack told me this number, I was, like, are you sure?</span> <span data-start="1502230">600%?</span> <span data-start="1503760">But it's real.</span> <span data-start="1505140">This has positively impacted Pinterest's overall revenue.</span> <span data-start="1509540">So now you're wondering.</span> <span data-start="1510720">This is all great.</span> <span data-start="1511890">How am I going to get there?</span> <span data-start="1513990">We've given you the tools.</span> <span data-start="1515440">We are here to support you.</span> <span data-start="1517190">And this talk is going to be up on YouTube</span> <span data-start="1518940">right after I say thank you.</span> <span data-start="1520500">So please go and build top-notch web experiences.</span> <span data-start="1523710">Do it.</span> <span data-start="1524370">Do it for the millennials.</span> <span data-start="1525570">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="1526410">[MUSIC PLAYING]</span> </section>
