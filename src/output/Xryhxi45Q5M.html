<section><span data-start="6.639" data-end="8.43"><span class="speaker">Aanchal Bahadur</span>: Hi, everyone, I'm Aanchal.</span> <span data-start="8.43" data-end="11.13">And I work on product partnerships for Chrome.</span> <span data-start="11.13" data-end="13.62">My job is to evangelize the web to all of you</span> <span data-start="13.62" data-end="16.32">and be an advocate for your feedback</span> <span data-start="16.32" data-end="19.2">as Chrome continues to build exciting new things that you</span> <span data-start="19.2" data-end="21.99">just heard about from Ben and [? Dion. ?]</span> <span data-start="21.99" data-end="24.43">Sure, I play that role.</span> <span data-start="24.43" data-end="28.35">But if you look harder, I really am the unicorn that all tech</span> <span data-start="28.35" data-end="31.09">companies are looking to solve.</span> <span data-start="31.09" data-end="32.549">I'm a millennial.</span> <span data-start="32.549" data-end="35.76">Happy being friends with my phone, my laptop,</span> <span data-start="35.76" data-end="39.36">my noise cancellation headphones, Fitbit, Kindle — </span> <span data-start="39.36" data-end="40.96">you name it.</span> <span data-start="40.96" data-end="44.31">So in this particular instance, I went on a vacation,</span> <span data-start="44.31" data-end="48.15">unlike millennials, with my mom.</span> <span data-start="48.15" data-end="51.21">I grew up in India, and I go back three times a year</span> <span data-start="51.21" data-end="53.52">to visit my dog, Rafiki.</span> <span data-start="53.52" data-end="56.46">And my family is usually there too.</span> <span data-start="56.46" data-end="59.67">And he usually needs to be held that way 24 hours a day.</span> <span data-start="59.67" data-end="63.33">And so someone needs to stay back —  had to be my father.</span> <span data-start="63.33" data-end="67.14">And so my mother and I drove up to the hills of Landour.</span> <span data-start="67.14" data-end="70.17">I know it sounds like a location from the "Lord of the Rings,"</span> <span data-start="70.17" data-end="73.32">but it actually is a town in Northern India.</span> <span data-start="73.32" data-end="76.95">And it's famous for great weather, good desserts,</span> <span data-start="76.95" data-end="81.94">and after this talk, for network connections.</span> <span data-start="81.94" data-end="83.88">So quick show of hands, how many of you</span> <span data-start="83.88" data-end="88.14">have experienced coffee shop Wi-Fi?</span> <span data-start="88.14" data-end="89.19">Expected.</span> <span data-start="89.19" data-end="91.53">I, for on —  always looking for that perfect spot</span> <span data-start="91.53" data-end="94.08">on a couch in a coffee shop solving the world's problems</span> <span data-start="94.08" data-end="95.92">on my laptop.</span> <span data-start="95.92" data-end="97.48">How about airplane Wi-Fi?</span> <span data-start="100.08" data-end="101.22">Wow, quite a few of you.</span> <span data-start="101.22" data-end="103.92">But yeah, definitely more frustrating than coffee shop</span> <span data-start="103.92" data-end="106.74">or conference Wi-Fi.</span> <span data-start="106.74" data-end="109.66">What about instances when you've paid for Wi-Fi,</span> <span data-start="109.66" data-end="111.63">and you've got no Wi-Fi?</span> <span data-start="111.63" data-end="114.24">Seemed like the entire population of Landour</span> <span data-start="114.24" data-end="118.35">was either on 2G or largely offline</span> <span data-start="118.35" data-end="120.21">or, like me, pointing my phone at network</span> <span data-start="120.21" data-end="125.43">towers demanding the internet like it's my human right.</span> <span data-start="125.43" data-end="129.05">Even in an offline situation, the web came to my rescue.</span> <span data-start="129.05" data-end="132.4">I had offlined a few articles on the best bakeries in Landour,</span> <span data-start="132.4" data-end="134.91">how to find more food in Landour,</span> <span data-start="134.91" data-end="137.4">and the web came to my rescue there.</span> <span data-start="137.4" data-end="140.43">So this map from the Chrome User Experience Report</span> <span data-start="140.43" data-end="143.56">shows you 4G densities across the world.</span> <span data-start="143.56" data-end="147.06">And it looks like in the US and some parts</span> <span data-start="147.06" data-end="149.59">where it's dark green is really good.</span> <span data-start="149.59" data-end="151.98">But think about the last time you were on your commute,</span> <span data-start="151.98" data-end="156.3">in the BART, or anywhere, on the train, reliable, fast 4G</span> <span data-start="156.3" data-end="158.15">is still a privilege.</span> <span data-start="158.15" data-end="162.12">And this isn't really a US or an emerging-market story.</span> <span data-start="162.12" data-end="165.72">The web needs to work for everyone at any time</span> <span data-start="165.72" data-end="169.01">everywhere.</span> <span data-start="169.01" data-end="171.69">These instant-loading experiences for everyone</span> <span data-start="171.69" data-end="173.87">make the web like that crucial friend</span> <span data-start="173.87" data-end="178.07">who's actually there for you when you need them the most.</span> <span data-start="178.07" data-end="180.48">But historically, despite its reach,</span> <span data-start="180.48" data-end="182.49">the web has not met user expectations</span> <span data-start="182.49" data-end="184.29">when it comes to mobile.</span> <span data-start="184.29" data-end="186.08">A lot of you are changing that narrative,</span> <span data-start="186.08" data-end="189.09">are shaping it real-time —  adoption of new web</span> <span data-start="189.09" data-end="191.52">technologies like Service Worker are playing</span> <span data-start="191.52" data-end="194.1">a role in changing this.</span> <span data-start="194.1" data-end="197.52">Investment in web performance literally pays off.</span> <span data-start="197.52" data-end="199.65">These companies across the world have</span> <span data-start="199.65" data-end="201.3">been investing in web performance</span> <span data-start="201.3" data-end="203.65">and have actually seen business impact.</span> <span data-start="203.65" data-end="207.33">LinkedIn Lite saw four times increase in job applications</span> <span data-start="207.33" data-end="208.8">by just building a progressive web</span> <span data-start="208.8" data-end="211.12">map using caching strategies.</span> <span data-start="211.12" data-end="214.05">Wayfair, like you just recently heard from Ben and Dion,</span> <span data-start="214.05" data-end="216.92">have also seen 10% conversion increase.</span> <span data-start="216.92" data-end="220.35">And ClickBus in Brazil is also seeing sales go up.</span> <span data-start="220.35" data-end="222.72">So it literally pays off.</span> <span data-start="222.72" data-end="225.63">So I looked for that exact point of intersection that lights up</span> <span data-start="225.63" data-end="229.426">a millennial's brain and makes them really happy.</span> <span data-start="229.426" data-end="231.3">And I realized that it pretty much comes down</span> <span data-start="231.3" data-end="235.24">to music, coffee, and photos.</span> <span data-start="235.24" data-end="239.19">Music on Spotify, coffee from Starbucks,</span> <span data-start="239.19" data-end="242.49">and photos of the latest fashion trends or whatever —  dogs,</span> <span data-start="242.49" data-end="243.21">if you're me — </span> <span data-start="243.21" data-end="245.1">on Pinterest.</span> <span data-start="245.1" data-end="247.02">I still remember my first few conversations</span> <span data-start="247.02" data-end="248.34">with these companies.</span> <span data-start="248.34" data-end="250.38">And the people that I actually spoke to</span> <span data-start="250.38" data-end="253.05">are here today to tell you the valuable lessons they</span> <span data-start="253.05" data-end="254.88">learned building on the web.</span> <span data-start="254.88" data-end="256.14">It hasn't been easy.</span> <span data-start="256.14" data-end="258.57">It's taken months and months of testing — </span> <span data-start="258.57" data-end="261.42">some failures, some learnings, but ultimately, they've</span> <span data-start="261.42" data-end="262.65">all seen business impact.</span> <span data-start="262.65" data-end="264.75">And we're glad they're here to share it with you.</span> <span data-start="264.75" data-end="266.46">So without further ado, please join me</span> <span data-start="266.46" data-end="268.05">in welcoming Rizzo from Spotify.</span> <span data-start="268.05"

<section><span data-start="271.357" data-end="272.523"><span class="speaker">Matt Rizzo</span>: Thanks, Aanchal.</span> <span data-start="272.523" data-end="275.008">[MUSIC PLAYING]</span> <span data-start="279" data-end="282.88">Last year, Spotify had a burning question.</span> <span data-start="282.88" data-end="287.17">Would having a mobile web music player allow us to grow faster?</span> <span data-start="287.17" data-end="291.34">Today I have the answer, and I'm here to share it with you.</span> <span data-start="291.34" data-end="293.17">I'm Matt Rizzo, and I'm a product manager</span> <span data-start="293.17" data-end="295.36">at the growth team at Spotify.</span> <span data-start="295.36" data-end="298.33">As a growth team, our goal is to drive sustained growth</span> <span data-start="298.33" data-end="300.65">of users around the world.</span> <span data-start="300.65" data-end="303.79">Within this greater growth team, my team's specific focus</span> <span data-start="303.79" data-end="306.58">is on using the web to capture and validate</span> <span data-start="306.58" data-end="308.68">growth opportunities.</span> <span data-start="308.68" data-end="311.35">Over the next few minutes, I'll share with you</span> <span data-start="311.35" data-end="314.74">how we decided if we should invest in the mobile web</span> <span data-start="314.74" data-end="316.88">and where we are today.</span> <span data-start="316.88" data-end="319.3">So let me take you back to 2017.</span> <span data-start="319.3" data-end="321.82">At this time, there was no way to listen to Spotify</span> <span data-start="321.82" data-end="323.32">on mobile web.</span> <span data-start="323.32" data-end="326.26">We already had a robust web experience on desktop</span> <span data-start="326.26" data-end="330.76">that was working on Windows, Chrome OS, and Mac OS.</span> <span data-start="330.76" data-end="333.35">But on mobile, we had no such option.</span> <span data-start="333.35" data-end="336.46">And frankly, we were unsure if we should.</span> <span data-start="336.46" data-end="338.34">Things seemed pretty good for us.</span> <span data-start="338.34" data-end="339.64">We had been growing fast.</span> <span data-start="339.64" data-end="343.43">And our native apps had impressive retention figures.</span> <span data-start="343.43" data-end="345.74">But every day, millions of people</span> <span data-start="345.74" data-end="349.34">visited our artist, album, and playlist links on the web.</span> <span data-start="349.34" data-end="350.96">And we're hit with a wall.</span> <span data-start="350.96" data-end="353.66">Each one of those users had to download the Spotify</span> <span data-start="353.66" data-end="355.67">app to listen to music.</span> <span data-start="355.67" data-end="358.13">Our hunch was that this hard-download wall was</span> <span data-start="358.13" data-end="359.776">hurting our ability to grow.</span> <span data-start="359.776" data-end="361.775">In fact, it was turning users away from Spotify.</span> <span data-start="364.94" data-end="367.13">So to explore this question in more depth,</span> <span data-start="367.13" data-end="369.26">we headed to Brazil.</span> <span data-start="369.26" data-end="370.79">Why Brazil?</span> <span data-start="370.79" data-end="373.16">Well, we saw two things that were important to us.</span> <span data-start="373.16" data-end="376.2">One, we had a ton of web traffic from Brazil.</span> <span data-start="376.2" data-end="377.791">It was a growth market for us.</span> <span data-start="377.791" data-end="378.29">And — </span> <span data-start="378.29" data-end="379.29">[TELEPHONE RINGING]</span> <span data-start="379.29" data-end="379.79">Hey.</span> <span data-start="382.61" data-end="385.04">And a significant amount of our users in Brazil</span> <span data-start="385.04" data-end="388.52">had less than a gigabyte of storage space on their phone.</span> <span data-start="388.52" data-end="390.41">This left these users in a constant state</span> <span data-start="390.41" data-end="391.64">of prioritization.</span> <span data-start="391.64" data-end="394.07">Should I keep this app on my phone?</span> <span data-start="394.07" data-end="395.84">Or should I delete it to make way</span> <span data-start="395.84" data-end="399.12">for this app I really need right now?</span> <span data-start="399.12" data-end="401.18">So after talking to more users in Brazil,</span> <span data-start="401.18" data-end="403.16">we realized this was a real challenge,</span> <span data-start="403.16" data-end="404.96">and it was affecting us.</span> <span data-start="404.96" data-end="407.72">This challenge caused people to either delete Spotify</span> <span data-start="407.72" data-end="410.51">or to not download it in the first place,</span> <span data-start="410.51" data-end="412.31">effectively, making it impossible</span> <span data-start="412.31" data-end="416.067">for them to use Spotify on their phone.</span> <span data-start="416.067" data-end="418.4">We also learned that there was another type of user that</span> <span data-start="418.4" data-end="421.04">could benefit from Spotify — </span> <span data-start="421.04" data-end="423.89">those who were unfamiliar with Spotify.</span> <span data-start="423.89" data-end="425.96">Imagine you've never heard of Spotify,</span> <span data-start="425.96" data-end="429.11">and you get a link sent to you from one of your friends.</span> <span data-start="429.11" data-end="431.51">You click that link to listen to a song.</span> <span data-start="431.51" data-end="433.38">And you end up on a page.</span> <span data-start="433.38" data-end="436.43">This page prompts you to download an app.</span> <span data-start="436.43" data-end="438.49">Downloading an app is a tall order for you</span> <span data-start="438.49" data-end="440.39">if you've never even heard of Spotify.</span> <span data-start="440.39" data-end="441.71">Why should I download this?</span> <span data-start="441.71" data-end="444.9">I just want to hear this one song.</span> <span data-start="444.9" data-end="448.59">So because of these insights, we had a strong perspective</span> <span data-start="448.59" data-end="451.2">that we should have a mobile web experience.</span> <span data-start="451.2" data-end="454.08">And there were two users that we thought we needed it for.</span> <span data-start="454.08" data-end="456.15">The first is people with low storage space</span> <span data-start="456.15" data-end="457.597">who can't download our app.</span> <span data-start="457.597" data-end="459.555">And the second is people who don't know Spotify</span> <span data-start="459.555" data-end="462.3">and are not familiar enough to actually decide</span> <span data-start="462.3" data-end="463.98">to download Spotify.</span> <span data-start="463.98" data-end="466.11">So we started experimenting.</span> <span data-start="466.11" data-end="468.99">We started experimenting to test our belief that the mobile web</span> <span data-start="468.99" data-end="471.37">would unlock growth.</span> <span data-start="471.37" data-end="473.43">We started really small.</span> <span data-start="473.43" data-end="476.07">Our first tests were fast and simple.</span> <span data-start="476.07" data-end="479.34">What if we gave our existing traffic, a limited player</span> <span data-start="479.34" data-end="482.22">from which they could play just one song, before downloading</span> <span data-start="482.22" data-end="483.962">the app?</span> <span data-start="483.962" data-end="485.92">Guess what happened when we launched this test.</span> <span data-start="489.73" data-end="493.15">We saw first-day plays increase by 25%.</span> <span data-start="493.15" data-end="494.32">This was huge.</span> <span data-start="494.32" data-end="496.6">That was the number of users who play within 24</span> <span data-start="496.6" data-end="498.55">hours of visiting our site.</span> <span data-start="498.55" data-end="501.19">After seeing this, we knew there was enormous demand</span> <span data-start="501.19" data-end="503.26">for a mobile web player.</span> <span data-start="503.26" data-end="505.84">So we took the next step.</span> <span data-start="505.84" data-end="509.09">Now that we had strong data to back up our intuition,</span> <span data-start="509.09" data-end="510.74">we went a step further.</span> <span data-start="510.74" data-end="513.669">We wanted to test two universes against each other,</span> <span data-start="513.669" data-end="518.14">one universe in which we had a mobile web player and then one</span> <span data-start="518.14" data-end="519.61">in which we didn't.</span> <span data-start="519.61" data-end="521.2">We wanted to do this because we wanted</span> <span data-start="521.2" data-end="524.35">to understand if there would be an incremental benefit to us</span> <span data-start="524.35" data-end="526.52">going in and investing in the web.</span> <span data-start="526.52" data-end="528.659">So we built a full experience.</span> <span data-start="528.659" data-end="530.95">And this full experience would allow for more immersive</span> <span data-start="530.95" data-end="532.21">sessions on the web.</span> <span data-start="532.21" data-end="534.52">And then we exposed it to 50% of our visitors.</span> <span data-start="537.07" data-end="540.35">This experience included three key Chrome features.</span> <span data-start="540.35" data-end="543.91">First, the media session API, and this allowed users</span> <span data-start="543.91" data-end="547.03">to control playback from the notification tray;</span> <span data-start="547.03" data-end="551.78">second, PWA install for Quick Access from the home screen;</span> <span data-start="551.78" data-end="554.71">and finally, we had protected content support</span> <span data-start="554.71" data-end="558.496">to ensure artists were guarded from piracy.</span> <span data-start="558.496" data-end="559.87">Guess what we saw from this test.</span> <span data-start="564.06" data-end="567.54">We saw a 54% increase in day-one plays,</span> <span data-start="567.54" data-end="571.26">and even a sustained 14% increase in active users all</span> <span data-start="571.26" data-end="572.91">the way through to day 60 — </span> <span data-start="572.91" data-end="574.87">so real retention.</span> <span data-start="574.87" data-end="576.66">We also learned about the power of the web</span> <span data-start="576.66" data-end="578.82">as a reactivation driver.</span> <span data-start="578.82" data-end="581.25">So 30% of the logins we were seeing</span> <span data-start="581.25" data-end="583.56">were coming from users who had not been active</span> <span data-start="583.56" data-end="585.48">in the past 28 days.</span> <span data-start="585.48" data-end="588.291">Our mobile web player was bringing churned users back</span> <span data-start="588.291" data-end="589.04">onto the platform.</span> <span data-start="591.78" data-end="593.55">We had one concern though.</span> <span data-start="593.55" data-end="595.53">And our concern was that launching a mobile web</span> <span data-start="595.53" data-end="598.68">experience would actually cannibalize our app downloads</span> <span data-start="598.68" data-end="601.98">and hurt those impressive retention figures I referenced.</span> <span data-start="601.98" data-end="604.53">But we've seen the opposite.</span> <span data-start="604.53" data-end="607.68">When people have access to a robust web experience,</span> <span data-start="607.68" data-end="612.85">they're actually more likely to download the Spotify app.</span> <span data-start="612.85" data-end="616.5">So to summarize, we had a hunch that the app download barrier</span> <span data-start="616.5" data-end="618.84">was turning users away from Spotify</span> <span data-start="618.84" data-end="620.97">and hurting our growth potential.</span> <span data-start="620.97" data-end="623.07">By building a web experience, we made</span> <span data-start="623.07" data-end="626.82">Spotify accessible to more users and have seen sustained growth</span> <span data-start="626.82" data-end="630.18">on both the web and in our native apps.</span> <span data-start="630.18" data-end="632.97">If you are on the fence about investing in web,</span> <span data-start="632.97" data-end="635.79">I would start by understanding what barriers are keeping you</span> <span data-start="635.79" data-end="638.43">from reaching your customers.</span> <span data-start="638.43" data-end="640.11">After you've done that, then start</span> <span data-start="640.11" data-end="643.53">understanding how the web can remove those barriers.</span> <span data-start="643.53" data-end="645.6">And finally, start with small tests</span> <span data-start="645.6" data-end="649.15">to validate your hypothesis that the web can unlock growth.</span> <span data-start="649.15" data-end="651.09">Just like Spotify, you might find</span> <span data-start="651.09" data-end="654.63">that the web is a powerful way to reach your goals.</span> <span data-start="654.63" data-end="656.46">Now, I'm going to turn it over to David</span> <span data-start="656.46" data-end="659.4">to talk about how Starbucks meets their customers where</span> <span data-start="659.4" data-end="660.24">they are — </span> <span data-start="660.24" data-end="662.157">on the web.</span> <span data-start="662.157" data-end="664.113">[APPLAUSE]</span> <span data-start="664.113" data-end="665.091">Good luck, man.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="665.091" data-end="666.174"><span class="speaker">David Brunelle</span>: Thank you.</span> <span data-start="666.174" data-end="668.025">[MUSIC PLAYING]</span> <span data-start="670.47" data-end="671.8">Good morning.</span> <span data-start="671.8" data-end="673.05">My name is David Bernelle.</span> <span data-start="673.05" data-end="675.3">And my team builds the digital product</span> <span data-start="675.3" data-end="677.73">used by Starbucks customers in the US</span> <span data-start="677.73" data-end="679.68">in a number of international markets.</span> <span data-start="679.68" data-end="682.38">And our job is to extend the Starbucks experience</span> <span data-start="682.38" data-end="685.29">beyond the four walls of our stores to the devices</span> <span data-start="685.29" data-end="688.08">that our customers have in their hands.</span> <span data-start="688.08" data-end="690.94">In early 2017, we asked ourselves,</span> <span data-start="690.94" data-end="693.57">how can we use the web to give our customers the best</span> <span data-start="693.57" data-end="695.46">experience possible?</span> <span data-start="695.46" data-end="699.32">That question led us to launch a PWA later that year.</span> <span data-start="699.32" data-end="701.91">And I'm excited to share some more of that story with you — </span> <span data-start="701.91" data-end="706.89">the why, the how, and some of what we've learned so far.</span> <span data-start="706.89" data-end="709.48">Before we started, we knew a few things.</span> <span data-start="709.48" data-end="712.37">First, millions of customers were using our native apps</span> <span data-start="712.37" data-end="716.01">every day to order ahead and pay in our stores.</span> <span data-start="716.01" data-end="718.17">Second, the Starbucks native apps</span> <span data-start="718.17" data-end="721.65">had a higher number of daily active users than our website.</span> <span data-start="721.65" data-end="724.41">But third, the Starbucks website had</span> <span data-start="724.41" data-end="727.08">significantly more monthly active users</span> <span data-start="727.08" data-end="728.88">than our native apps.</span> <span data-start="728.88" data-end="730.95">In fact, our website was reaching 6 million</span> <span data-start="730.95" data-end="735">more people every month than our IOS app.</span> <span data-start="735" data-end="737.19">The opportunity for us was huge.</span> <span data-start="737.19" data-end="739.2">If we could provide a better experience</span> <span data-start="739.2" data-end="742.08">to these 6 million users, we believed</span> <span data-start="742.08" data-end="744.52">they'd have a more meaningful interaction with Starbucks</span> <span data-start="744.52" data-end="746.827">and that that would be great for our business.</span> <span data-start="746.827" data-end="748.41">It was important for us to build a web</span> <span data-start="748.41" data-end="751.41">app that was as full-featured and pleasant to use</span> <span data-start="751.41" data-end="752.82">as our native apps.</span> <span data-start="752.82" data-end="758.22">That meant that it had to be reliable, fast, and engaging.</span> <span data-start="758.22" data-end="760.83">Our customers tend to use higher-end devices,</span> <span data-start="760.83" data-end="764.46">but they experience a wide variety of network conditions.</span> <span data-start="764.46" data-end="766.14">We have stores all over — </span> <span data-start="766.14" data-end="768.45">suburban shopping centers, basements,</span> <span data-start="768.45" data-end="772.371">and office buildings, and airports, for some examples.</span> <span data-start="772.371" data-end="774.12">Customers at these stores might experience</span> <span data-start="774.12" data-end="778.74">3G, unpredictable Wi-Fi like captive Wi-Fi portals,</span> <span data-start="778.74" data-end="780.69">or have no connection at all.</span> <span data-start="780.69" data-end="783.66">When a customer walks into any of these locations,</span> <span data-start="783.66" data-end="785.43">they need to be able to open their app,</span> <span data-start="785.43" data-end="789.9">scan their barcode to pay, and be on their way quickly.</span> <span data-start="789.9" data-end="792.15">We addressed this by using some of the web platform's</span> <span data-start="792.15" data-end="793.62">capabilities — </span> <span data-start="793.62" data-end="797.61">JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and other static assets</span> <span data-start="797.61" data-end="798.96">are cached locally.</span> <span data-start="798.96" data-end="801.956">Don't pay too much attention to the code you see up on screen.</span> <span data-start="801.956" data-end="804.33">It's there to illustrate just how little code is actually</span> <span data-start="804.33" data-end="807.84">required to implement runtime caching and precaching</span> <span data-start="807.84" data-end="809.85">thanks to Workbox.</span> <span data-start="809.85" data-end="813.3">User-specific data is then encrypted and stored locally</span> <span data-start="813.3" data-end="815.01">with IndexedDB.</span> <span data-start="815.01" data-end="817.8">This means that, when a customer opens up the PWA,</span> <span data-start="817.8" data-end="821.38">she can expect it to work.</span> <span data-start="821.38" data-end="824.02">Customers need our PWA to be fast.</span> <span data-start="824.02" data-end="826.81">No one wants to be standing in front of the barista waiting</span> <span data-start="826.81" data-end="829.63">for their app to load while a line develops</span> <span data-start="829.63" data-end="831.43">behind them, especially if you're</span> <span data-start="831.43" data-end="834.7">a millennial like Aanchal.</span> <span data-start="834.7" data-end="837.79">Some strategies that helped us make the PWA fast — </span> <span data-start="837.79" data-end="840.97">webpack helps us keep our JavaScript bundle small.</span> <span data-start="840.97" data-end="844.48">This means that devices only need to download and parse</span> <span data-start="844.48" data-end="846.76">the code needed to power the experience</span> <span data-start="846.76" data-end="848.82">they're trying to access.</span> <span data-start="848.82" data-end="852.43">We use the Service Worker API and Workbox precache</span> <span data-start="852.43" data-end="855.01">to download additional JavaScript in CSS</span> <span data-start="855.01" data-end="857.08">before the user needs it.</span> <span data-start="857.08" data-end="860.53">Our CDN dynamically optimizes images,</span> <span data-start="860.53" data-end="865.19">serving the right size and the right format at the right time.</span> <span data-start="865.19" data-end="869.14">These and other techniques mean that our PWA's initial time</span> <span data-start="869.14" data-end="873.22">to interactive is two times faster than the web experiences</span> <span data-start="873.22" data-end="874.36">it replaced.</span> <span data-start="874.36" data-end="878.23">And subsequent page loads are lightning fast.</span> <span data-start="878.23" data-end="881.5">Starbucks customers trust us to keep their personal information</span> <span data-start="881.5" data-end="883.99">and payment data safe and secure.</span> <span data-start="883.99" data-end="887.71">The Credential Management API gives us the ability</span> <span data-start="887.71" data-end="889.42">to provide customers the opportunity</span> <span data-start="889.42" data-end="892.057">to sign in using saved credentials,</span> <span data-start="892.057" data-end="893.89">eliminating a lot of the friction associated</span> <span data-start="893.89" data-end="895.47">with signing it.</span> <span data-start="895.47" data-end="898.39">Today, 28% of customers using Chrome</span> <span data-start="898.39" data-end="901.3">across mobile and desktop use the Credential Management API</span> <span data-start="901.3" data-end="904.03">to authenticate.</span> <span data-start="904.03" data-end="906.31">Using Add to Home screen, customers</span> <span data-start="906.31" data-end="909.94">can quickly install the Starbucks PWA to their phone.</span> <span data-start="909.94" data-end="912.13">Once on their home screen, it's indistinguishable</span> <span data-start="912.13" data-end="913.587">from native apps.</span> <span data-start="913.587" data-end="915.67">And paying for your order by scanning your barcode</span> <span data-start="915.67" data-end="918.87">is only two taps away.</span> <span data-start="918.87" data-end="920.72">And it's really a joy to use.</span> <span data-start="920.72" data-end="923.72">Throughout the experience, we've added thoughtful animations</span> <span data-start="923.72" data-end="925.79">and meaningful user feedback.</span> <span data-start="925.79" data-end="929.24">The experience is compliant with web content accessibility</span> <span data-start="929.24" data-end="930.86">guidelines.</span> <span data-start="930.86" data-end="933.14">We use a pattern library to ensure consistency</span> <span data-start="933.14" data-end="938.342">throughout the PWA and other web experiences at Starbucks.</span> <span data-start="938.342" data-end="939.8">The pattern library is a collection</span> <span data-start="939.8" data-end="942.47">of React UI components, shared styles,</span> <span data-start="942.47" data-end="944.57">and commonly used utilities.</span> <span data-start="944.57" data-end="947.86">Developers consume the pattern library via NPM.</span> <span data-start="947.86" data-end="949.58">And we also expose it as a web app</span> <span data-start="949.58" data-end="952.19">so developers can access documentation</span> <span data-start="952.19" data-end="955.31">and so that folks from our design and product teams</span> <span data-start="955.31" data-end="957.44">can access components and interact with them</span> <span data-start="957.44" data-end="961.28">to see exactly how they'll behave in a browser.</span> <span data-start="961.28" data-end="963.23">The great thing about building a PWA</span> <span data-start="963.23" data-end="965.69">is that it runs in a wide variety of devices</span> <span data-start="965.69" data-end="968.51">that might not be supported by our native apps</span> <span data-start="968.51" data-end="971.21">like this commenter from Hacker News who</span> <span data-start="971.21" data-end="973.64">was excited to discover that they had a Starbucks app that</span> <span data-start="973.64" data-end="977.61">worked on their BlackBerry.</span> <span data-start="977.61" data-end="980.55">We built our PWA to be mobile first.</span> <span data-start="980.55" data-end="982.5">But because we built it to be responsive,</span> <span data-start="982.5" data-end="985.41">it provides a great experience on desktop too.</span> <span data-start="985.41" data-end="987.78">And we've discovered that customers love to order coffee</span> <span data-start="987.78" data-end="989.01">from the desktop.</span> <span data-start="989.01" data-end="992.79">In fact, 25% of our orders through the Starbucks PWA</span> <span data-start="992.79" data-end="993.915">come from desktop browsers.</span> <span data-start="996.51" data-end="999.27">In short, we've learned that customers love the Starbucks</span> <span data-start="999.27" data-end="1003.2">PWA, and it's been great for business.</span> <span data-start="1003.2" data-end="1006.05">Since we launched app.starbucks.com and created</span> <span data-start="1006.05" data-end="1009.02">an experience that's on par with that of our native apps,</span> <span data-start="1009.02" data-end="1012.29">the number of customers joining Starbucks rewards via the web</span> <span data-start="1012.29" data-end="1015.27">has increased by 65%.</span> <span data-start="1015.27" data-end="1017.49">So should you invest in the web?</span> <span data-start="1017.49" data-end="1019.28">Yeah, absolutely.</span> <span data-start="1019.28" data-end="1021.62">The web's reach is massive, and the barriers</span> <span data-start="1021.62" data-end="1025.28">to create a high-performing PWA are quite low.</span> <span data-start="1025.28" data-end="1027.14">You've heard it from Rizzo at Spotify,</span> <span data-start="1027.14" data-end="1030.7">now from me at Starbucks, that the results are real.</span> <span data-start="1030.7" data-end="1033.829">Now I'd like to introduce you to Zack from Pinterest</span> <span data-start="1033.829" data-end="1037.49">to tell you about how their team keeps their PWA fast.</span> <span data-start="1037.49" data-end="1040.85">[APPLAUSE]</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1046.14" data-end="1047.504"><span class="speaker">Zack Argyle</span>: Hi.</span> <span data-start="1047.504" data-end="1048.42">My name's Zach Argyle.</span> <span data-start="1048.42" data-end="1051.36">And I lead the web platform team at Pinterest.</span> <span data-start="1051.36" data-end="1054.33">About a year ago, we teamed up with the growth team</span> <span data-start="1054.33" data-end="1059.79">to rebuild Pinterest mobile web from scratch, but why?</span> <span data-start="1059.79" data-end="1065.555">Well, for one, our users did not like the current offering.</span> <span data-start="1065.555" data-end="1068.41">[LAUGHTER]</span> <span data-start="1068.41" data-end="1069.95">It hurts because it's so real.</span> <span data-start="1072.81" data-end="1074.91">So Stephanie, if you're watching,</span> <span data-start="1074.91" data-end="1077.76">my sincerest apologies.</span> <span data-start="1077.76" data-end="1080.63">At the time, our mobile website was essentially just an upsell</span> <span data-start="1080.63" data-end="1082.62">for our native app.</span> <span data-start="1082.62" data-end="1084.48">However, we noticed that the number</span> <span data-start="1084.48" data-end="1086.58">of users who actually downloaded the app compared</span> <span data-start="1086.58" data-end="1089.55">to the number that actually came to the mobile website</span> <span data-start="1089.55" data-end="1090.73">was very low.</span> <span data-start="1090.73" data-end="1092.7">And we knew we could do better.</span> <span data-start="1092.7" data-end="1095.28">So last year, we shipped a from-scratch rewrite</span> <span data-start="1095.28" data-end="1097.74">of the mobile website in just under three months.</span> <span data-start="1100.46" data-end="1104.09">It was four times faster to load for initial page loads</span> <span data-start="1104.09" data-end="1106.934">and almost six times faster on subsequent visits.</span> <span data-start="1106.934" data-end="1108.35">The initial JavaScript bundle size</span> <span data-start="1108.35" data-end="1112.88">decreased from 650 kilobytes to less than 200.</span> <span data-start="1112.88" data-end="1117.62">And our CSS payload decreased from 160 kilobytes</span> <span data-start="1117.62" data-end="1121.88">to 6 inlined into the app shell.</span> <span data-start="1121.88" data-end="1123.15">But what about now?</span> <span data-start="1123.15" data-end="1123.65">It's done.</span> <span data-start="1123.65" data-end="1124.15">We shipped.</span> <span data-start="1124.15" data-end="1125.21">It's over.</span> <span data-start="1125.21" data-end="1126.62">We can all go home.</span> <span data-start="1126.62" data-end="1128.01">We did our job.</span> <span data-start="1128.01" data-end="1131.08">Unfortunately, entropy is very real.</span> <span data-start="1131.08" data-end="1133.07">At Pinterest, we have over 100 engineers</span> <span data-start="1133.07" data-end="1135.662">committing to the web code base.</span> <span data-start="1135.662" data-end="1137.37">So we had to ask ourselves, what could we</span> <span data-start="1137.37" data-end="1140.46">do to make sure that this fast experience stayed fast</span> <span data-start="1140.46" data-end="1142.35">as time went by?</span> <span data-start="1142.35" data-end="1144.95">The answer was performance budgets.</span> <span data-start="1147.97" data-end="1150.87">At Pinterest, this breaks down into three sections — </span> <span data-start="1150.87" data-end="1154.154">logging, alerting, and prevention.</span> <span data-start="1154.154" data-end="1155.82">There's two main metrics that we look at</span> <span data-start="1155.82" data-end="1157.79">to ensure that the PWA stays fast.</span> <span data-start="1157.79" data-end="1159.63">And the first is JavaScript bundle size.</span> <span data-start="1162.57" data-end="1165">For logging, we wrote a webpack plugin</span> <span data-start="1165" data-end="1167.82">that reports development and production bundle sizes</span> <span data-start="1167.82" data-end="1169.205">to our internal logging system.</span> <span data-start="1169.205" data-end="1171.51">This gave us the ability to track bundle size changes</span> <span data-start="1171.51" data-end="1176.26">over time for all of our web applications.</span> <span data-start="1176.26" data-end="1178.41">And then, using those real-time metrics,</span> <span data-start="1178.41" data-end="1180">we built out dashboards with alerting</span> <span data-start="1180" data-end="1184.95">enabled to make sure that all of our core bundles stay small.</span> <span data-start="1184.95" data-end="1186.81">We know painfully, from experience,</span> <span data-start="1186.81" data-end="1189.84">that one of the main offenders of JavaScript bloat</span> <span data-start="1189.84" data-end="1193.35">is importing something with a large dependency tree.</span> <span data-start="1193.35" data-end="1197.28">A single line of code could add tens or hundreds of kilobytes</span> <span data-start="1197.28" data-end="1199.28">to your bundle.</span> <span data-start="1199.28" data-end="1202.25">So to help prevent this from happening in our monorepo,</span> <span data-start="1202.25" data-end="1205.22">we wrote an ESLint Plugin to disallow imports</span> <span data-start="1205.22" data-end="1206.7">from certain paths.</span> <span data-start="1206.7" data-end="1209.93">For example, our mobile web-only code base cannot import from</span> <span data-start="1209.93" data-end="1211.16">our desktop-only code base.</span> <span data-start="1214.43" data-end="1217.68">The other metric we care about is a composite performance</span> <span data-start="1217.68" data-end="1221.28">metric called Pinner Wait Time, or PWT.</span> <span data-start="1221.28" data-end="1223.41">It's a combination of time-to-interactive and image</span> <span data-start="1223.41" data-end="1225.12">load times.</span> <span data-start="1225.12" data-end="1226.841">When deciding what to measure, look</span> <span data-start="1226.841" data-end="1228.09">to what your users care about.</span> <span data-start="1228.09" data-end="1231.54">For us, that's images.</span> <span data-start="1231.54" data-end="1234.33">Until the above-the-fold images are loaded, to our users,</span> <span data-start="1234.33" data-end="1235.569">page load is not complete.</span> <span data-start="1235.569" data-end="1237.36">So that time-to-interactive was not enough.</span> <span data-start="1237.36" data-end="1239.13">So we created a custom metric specific</span> <span data-start="1239.13" data-end="1241.38">to our service and user expectations.</span> <span data-start="1241.38" data-end="1243.599">We also tracked more granular performance metrics,</span> <span data-start="1243.599" data-end="1245.64">like time-to-first-paint and time-to-interactive,</span> <span data-start="1245.64" data-end="1248.31">which are really helpful for debugging performance</span> <span data-start="1248.31" data-end="1250.08">regressions.</span> <span data-start="1250.08" data-end="1253.35">We also have client-side logging that includes browser, country,</span> <span data-start="1253.35" data-end="1255.18">user state, and many other fields</span> <span data-start="1255.18" data-end="1257.792">that are helpful for segmenting usage.</span> <span data-start="1257.792" data-end="1259.5">Again, we set up dashboards with alerting</span> <span data-start="1259.5" data-end="1261.999">enabled to make sure that all these [INAUDIBLE] pages stayed</span> <span data-start="1261.999" data-end="1263.37">fast.</span> <span data-start="1263.37" data-end="1266.04">We did notice that one of the main offenders of page load</span> <span data-start="1266.04" data-end="1268.98">regression was the hundreds of experiments</span> <span data-start="1268.98" data-end="1271.82">that we had running at any given time.</span> <span data-start="1271.82" data-end="1274.12">So we added performance regression information, front</span> <span data-start="1274.12" data-end="1276.38">and center in our experiment dashboard,</span> <span data-start="1276.38" data-end="1279.49">so the engineers could be aware of any performance impact</span> <span data-start="1279.49" data-end="1281.89">caused by their experiments.</span> <span data-start="1281.89" data-end="1284.17">This also means that you can see the performance</span> <span data-start="1284.17" data-end="1288.98">improvements of your experiment as well, which was really cool.</span> <span data-start="1288.98" data-end="1291.58">These are just a few examples of how we incorporated logging,</span> <span data-start="1291.58" data-end="1293.731">alerting, and prevention into our workflows</span> <span data-start="1293.731" data-end="1295.73">to ensure that progressive web apps stayed fast.</span> <span data-start="1295.73" data-end="1298.69">And we saw incredible results from building out</span> <span data-start="1298.69" data-end="1300.89">the experience.</span> <span data-start="1300.89" data-end="1303.05">Year over year on the mobile web,</span> <span data-start="1303.05" data-end="1309.2">we saw a 103% increase in weekly users, nearly 300%</span> <span data-start="1309.2" data-end="1313.03">increase in session length, and our mobile website</span> <span data-start="1313.03" data-end="1315.94">has since been our number one platform</span> <span data-start="1315.94" data-end="1321.03">for new user sign-ups surpassing Android, IOS, and desktop web.</span> <span data-start="1321.03" data-end="1322.95">You've seen it from David and Rizzo.</span> <span data-start="1322.95" data-end="1325.17">The future is truly in the browser.</span> <span data-start="1325.17" data-end="1327.422">And performance is the foundation of it all.</span> <span data-start="1327.422" data-end="1329.13">With these budgeting strategies in place,</span> <span data-start="1329.13" data-end="1331.296">we've continued to see incredible growth, especially</span> <span data-start="1331.296" data-end="1333.33">in emerging markets where bandwidth is limited</span> <span data-start="1333.33" data-end="1335.64">and low-end devices are common.</span> <span data-start="1335.64" data-end="1338.79">In some countries, a year after shipping our new experience,</span> <span data-start="1338.79" data-end="1342.57">weekly users had increased by over 300%.</span> <span data-start="1342.57" data-end="1347.81">And the number of pins seen had increased by over 600%.</span> <span data-start="1347.81" data-end="1349.85">For Pinterest, the number of pins seen</span> <span data-start="1349.85" data-end="1352.55">is directly correlated with our overall revenue.</span> <span data-start="1355.72" data-end="1357.91">Investing in improving and maintaining performance</span> <span data-start="1357.91" data-end="1361.07">has directly impacted the company's bottom line.</span> <span data-start="1361.07" data-end="1365.26">So if you, like Pinterest, care about an exceptional user</span> <span data-start="1365.26" data-end="1369.67">experience, regardless of device, network, or conditions,</span> <span data-start="1369.67" data-end="1373.16">build a progressive web app with performance as a priority.</span> <span data-start="1373.16"

data-start="1377.98" data-end="1379.81">"Pinterest Engineering" blog.</span> <span data-start="1379.81" data-end="1381.97">And with that, I'm happy to bring Aanchal back</span> <span data-start="1381.97" data-end="1384.602">on stage to share a quick recap for you all.</span> <span data-start="1384.602" data-end="1387.906">[APPLAUSE]</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1392.16" data-end="1394.38"><span class="speaker">Aanchal Bahadur</span>: All right, so it's day one.</span> <span data-start="1394.38" data-end="1396.431">It's just the first start of Chrome Dev Summit.</span> <span data-start="1396.431" data-end="1399.055">Can you please join me in giving a thunderous round of applause</span> <span data-start="1399.055" data-end="1402.799">to David, Zack, and Rizzo for summing up months</span> <span data-start="1402.799" data-end="1403.84">and months of hard work — </span> <span data-start="1403.84" data-end="1405.58">[APPLAUSE]</span> <span data-start="1405.58" data-end="1406.86">into just five minutes?</span> <span data-start="1409.46" data-end="1410.06">All right.</span> <span data-start="1410.06" data-end="1412.59">So if you remember what I said at the beginning,</span> <span data-start="1412.59" data-end="1415.65">you also know I have a very short attention span.</span> <span data-start="1415.65" data-end="1417.18">So I was backstage making notes.</span> <span data-start="1417.18" data-end="1419.001">I have three things to share with you.</span> <span data-start="1419.001" data-end="1420.375">This is the part of the job where</span> <span data-start="1420.375" data-end="1422.21">you remember to keep your phones out</span> <span data-start="1422.21" data-end="1424.13">to take photographs and screenshots if you're</span> <span data-start="1424.13" data-end="1425.54">watching us on video.</span> <span data-start="1425.54" data-end="1428.9">Very quickly —  three business wins from Pinterest, Starbucks,</span> <span data-start="1428.9" data-end="1430.54">and Spotify.</span> <span data-start="1430.54" data-end="1434">So if, like Spotify, you want to get more users,</span> <span data-start="1434" data-end="1435.38">remove friction.</span> <span data-start="1435.38" data-end="1438.8">It seems pretty obvious, but the results are real.</span> <span data-start="1438.8" data-end="1440">Run multiple tests.</span> <span data-start="1440" data-end="1441.77">Be convinced, just like they were.</span> <span data-start="1441.77" data-end="1445.28">Rizzo told me it took eight or nine tests for them to do this.</span> <span data-start="1445.28" data-end="1448.07">And the results —  an increase in activation,</span> <span data-start="1448.07" data-end="1455.58">54%, and retention, 14% increase in day-60 active users.</span> <span data-start="1455.58" data-end="1458.01">If, like Starbucks you want to meet your users</span> <span data-start="1458.01" data-end="1459.12">where they are — </span> <span data-start="1459.12" data-end="1462.57">airports, hostel rooms, tanking up on caffeine,</span> <span data-start="1462.57" data-end="1466.84">wherever they might be, be sure to be using Workbox caching</span> <span data-start="1466.84" data-end="1468.04">strategies.</span> <span data-start="1468.04" data-end="1470.44">And my favorite thing about their progressive web app</span> <span data-start="1470.44" data-end="1471.91">is the thoughtful animations that</span> <span data-start="1471.91" data-end="1475.51">pop up to make sure that my 100 different customizations</span> <span data-start="1475.51" data-end="1477.67">of my coffee are actually accurate.</span> <span data-start="1477.67" data-end="1479.17">It's fantastic.</span> <span data-start="1479.17" data-end="1482.38">65% increase in number of customers joining the Starbucks</span> <span data-start="1482.38" data-end="1484.12">Rewards program — </span> <span data-start="1484.12" data-end="1487.23">direct business impact.</span> <span data-start="1487.23" data-end="1490.95">And finally, if you want to set a standard for web performance,</span> <span data-start="1490.95" data-end="1492.45">be like Pinterest.</span> <span data-start="1492.45" data-end="1496.31">Focus on performance, focus on setting a performance budget — </span> <span data-start="1496.31" data-end="1499.14">600% increase in number of pins seen.</span> <span data-start="1499.14" data-end="1502.23">When Zack told me this number, I was, like, are you sure?</span> <span data-start="1502.23" data-end="1503.76">600%?</span> <span data-start="1503.76" data-end="1505.14">But it's real.</span> <span data-start="1505.14" data-end="1509.54">This has positively impacted Pinterest's overall revenue.</span> <span data-start="1509.54" data-end="1510.72">So now you're wondering.</span> <span data-start="1510.72" data-end="1511.89">This is all great.</span> <span data-start="1511.89" data-end="1513.99">How am I going to get there?</span> <span data-start="1513.99" data-end="1515.44">We've given you the tools.</span> <span data-start="1515.44" data-end="1517.19">We are here to support you.</span> <span data-start="1517.19" data-end="1518.94">And this talk is going to be up on YouTube</span> <span data-start="1518.94" data-end="1520.5">right after I say thank you.</span> <span data-start="1520.5" data-end="1523.71">So please go and build top-notch web experiences.</span> <span data-start="1523.71" data-end="1524.37">Do it.</span> <span data-start="1524.37" data-end="1525.57">Do it for the millennials.</span> <span data-start="1525.57" data-end="1526.41">Thank you.</span>
