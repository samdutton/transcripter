<section><span data-start="9180"><span class="speaker">Cheney Tsai</span>: So we work on a technical consulting</span> <span data-start="11070">team at Google, and we get to see companies</span> <span data-start="12990">all around the world push the boundaries of the modern web.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="16482"><span class="speaker">Ramya Raghavan</span>: And while you might</span> <span data-start="17940">have heard some great sessions today</span> <span data-start="19770">talking about different modern web technologies,</span> <span data-start="22650">we are here to focus on the real-world challenges faced</span> <span data-start="26280">by e-commerce companies in implementing</span> <span data-start="28410">these technologies.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="29215"><span class="speaker">Cheney Tsai</span>: So since we're talking about the real world,</span> <span data-start="31590">a real-world metaphor.</span> <span data-start="33120">Maintaining a website is a lot like maintaining a house.</span> <span data-start="36540">This right here is the house that I grew up in.</span> <span data-start="39060">It's probably not like the house that you grew up in,</span> <span data-start="41635">just like the website you work on is different from, say,</span> <span data-start="44010">the person over there.</span> <span data-start="45420">But some things are the same.</span> <span data-start="46890">You have maybe a place you sleep.</span> <span data-start="48540">Maybe there's a dining room.</span> <span data-start="50490">Then something breaks, like the AC,</span> <span data-start="52260">you might say, well, I can fix it.</span> <span data-start="54460">And your friend might say, no, you should just</span> <span data-start="57180">call somebody, all right?</span> <span data-start="58440">Over time, when you moved in, when</span> <span data-start="60690">you moved to that new platform, it</span> <span data-start="62290">might look like the room over here on the left.</span> <span data-start="64840">But technical debt, feature creep</span> <span data-start="66900">because Black Friday and the holiday season is coming up,</span> <span data-start="69570">you're trying to get things in, and you get kind of messy.</span> <span data-start="73257">And I think that a house is a great metaphor</span> <span data-start="75090">because it's like an e-commerce site these days.</span> <span data-start="77380">It's not just about landing in one place and you're done.</span> <span data-start="79410">It's about the journey.</span> <span data-start="80368">You're going from room to room.</span> <span data-start="81812">You're going from a page to another page,</span> <span data-start="83520">from the home page to the search page to the checkout page.</span> <span data-start="86659">And if the room is like this, you get kind of confused.</span> <span data-start="88950">You don't want your user to feel confused and get lost in it.</span> <span data-start="91590">So it's time to remodel.</span> <span data-start="93120">Maybe you need to upgrade your foundations.</span> <span data-start="96210">Obviously, to remodel, we've talked</span> <span data-start="97950">about a lot of different things throughout today</span> <span data-start="100470">and other talks, things like that,</span> <span data-start="102720">and like all tools in the tool box,</span> <span data-start="105480">things like Progressive Web Apps, AMP,</span> <span data-start="107850">Google sign in, Google Page —  they're great tools.</span> <span data-start="110440">But just like I can't go to the store</span> <span data-start="112200">and buy a power drill that I saw a great commercial of,</span> <span data-start="114750">and be like, I'm going to nail this remodel.</span> <span data-start="117130">I could very well destroy everything.</span> <span data-start="119280">So like all tools, just because they fit — </span> <span data-start="122280">they're kind of like puzzle pieces.</span> <span data-start="124710">The two pieces fit, but you might not be actually making</span> <span data-start="127400">progress towards a big picture.</span> <span data-start="129449">So what's the big picture?</span> <span data-start="131050">So at Google, we like to say, focus on the user</span> <span data-start="133340">and all else follows.</span> <span data-start="134790">And so we really think that that full picture</span> <span data-start="137095">you're building towards, whatever</span> <span data-start="138470">you choose to do in the e-commerce journey,</span> <span data-start="140570">you need to improve user friction.</span> <span data-start="143390">Think about if you're trying to add service workers, if you're</span> <span data-start="146090">trying to try some of the cool, new APIs, and like, WebXR</span> <span data-start="148970">and things like that.</span> <span data-start="149930">How is your solution actually improving the user's journey?</span> <span data-start="153820">Because there's no silver bullet here.</span> <span data-start="155920">To talk about this is Ramya.</span> <span data-start="157340">You had an example?</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="158210"><span class="speaker">Ramya Raghavan</span>: Of course.</span> <span data-start="159410">Saatva is a company that sells luxury mattresses.</span> <span data-start="162710">And they wanted to ensure that their users have</span> <span data-start="165440">a very smooth and fast online shopping experience.</span> <span data-start="168890">They decided to use AMP as a technology to enable that.</span> <span data-start="173600">In their first iteration of their product details</span> <span data-start="176030">pages where they created the AMP portion of that page,</span> <span data-start="179390">the user had actually to click from the AMP page</span> <span data-start="182750">to the product details page and then click again</span> <span data-start="185120">to get to the cart page.</span> <span data-start="186800">They realized that this was not the best user experience.</span> <span data-start="189720">So in their second iteration, they changed the design such</span> <span data-start="193220">that the user can see the full details of the product</span> <span data-start="196640">within the AMP page and be able to click to add to cart,</span> <span data-start="200210">and even see the cart from the same page.</span> <span data-start="203220">This resulted in a reduction of friction for the user,</span> <span data-start="206390">going from three taps to two all in the same page</span> <span data-start="209730">instead of three pages earlier.</span> <span data-start="211640">The results were astounding.</span> <span data-start="213620">Between the two iterations of AMP,</span> <span data-start="215510">they saw a 50% improvement in conversions.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="218360"><span class="speaker">Cheney Tsai</span>: Thanks.</span> <span data-start="219350">So it's not just AMP.</span> <span data-start="221340">If you're creating things like a Progressive Web App,</span> <span data-start="223650">you might run into this too.</span> <span data-start="224850">So here's an example from Expedia.</span> <span data-start="226640">Expedia has been working on a brand new front-end platform.</span> <span data-start="229370">It's four times faster on slow 3G, on lower end devices.</span> <span data-start="233631">It's really great.</span> <span data-start="234380">And their CEO even recently said in their earnings</span> <span data-start="237110">call that speed benefits deliver conversion benefits.</span> <span data-start="240065">Usually, we'll say, we're going to stop here.</span> <span data-start="241940">Great case study.</span> <span data-start="243220">Instead, we're going to go into an interesting learning they</span> <span data-start="245720">had as part of this process.</span> <span data-start="247430">So Expedia, like many of the sites that you might work on,</span> <span data-start="250490">is a large e-commerce site.</span> <span data-start="251632">They're not just going to move from one old platform that's</span> <span data-start="254090">clearly working over to a new platform overnight.</span> <span data-start="256394">They need to do this in a piecemeal way</span> <span data-start="258019">because maybe some teams are on a new platform.</span> <span data-start="261260">They have to socialize it to other teams.</span> <span data-start="263192">And so in doing that, they actually</span> <span data-start="264650">learned an interesting lesson.</span> <span data-start="266290">Users value consistency.</span> <span data-start="268490">So some users during the migration process,</span> <span data-start="271160">they landed on the old experience.</span> <span data-start="273020">And then, after clicking around, you</span> <span data-start="274640">get put into the new experience that's faster.</span> <span data-start="277190">And they might move back and forth a couple of times.</span> <span data-start="279470">That population, to no surprise, actually probably did poorer</span> <span data-start="283610">than if you just stayed in one experience or another.</span> <span data-start="286430">It's very much like, if I was up here,</span> <span data-start="288080">and I was wearing one brown shoe and one black shoe,</span> <span data-start="290345">you probably couldn't take me quite as seriously</span> <span data-start="292490">as you're taking me right now.</span> <span data-start="293860">Hopefully, it's on the serious side.</span> <span data-start="296210">So I think users value user journeys that are consistent.</span> <span data-start="301400">So make sure your solutions, not only in that page</span> <span data-start="304235">you're building, but in the entire journey</span> <span data-start="306800">and how you're measuring it is actually reducing friction.</span> <span data-start="310910">Of course, what I'm saying, though,</span> <span data-start="312530">means that if your journey needs to be consistent</span> <span data-start="315080">all the way from, say, the entry point for the search results</span> <span data-start="318590">page to checkout, you're probably</span> <span data-start="320600">going to run into a lot of challenges.</span> <span data-start="322237">So when we work with a lot of e-commerce partners,</span> <span data-start="324320">we run into three main challenges.</span> <span data-start="325984">Number one is something that many of you</span> <span data-start="327650">probably think about, organizational alignment.</span> <span data-start="330080">Then you get to technical approach,</span> <span data-start="332190">and then finally, measurement.</span> <span data-start="333460">And so we'll talk about that today.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="334918"><span class="speaker">Ramya Raghavan</span>: Of course.</span> <span data-start="336410">Let's talk about the first challenge,</span> <span data-start="338150">organizational alignment.</span> <span data-start="340370">When I talk to people in e-commerce companies</span> <span data-start="342470">and ask them, do you think investing in performance</span> <span data-start="345260">projects to improve user experience will help improve</span> <span data-start="348830">your core business metrics, the answer is an immediate yes.</span> <span data-start="354080">However, when it comes time to prioritizing performance</span> <span data-start="357620">projects, there's always several hurdles — </span> <span data-start="360140">lack of time, lack of resources, you name it.</span> <span data-start="364040">One of the key ingredients that's missing here</span> <span data-start="366410">is organizational alignment.</span> <span data-start="369740">Performance is not just an engineering priority.</span> <span data-start="373310">Why?</span> <span data-start="374210">Consider this.</span> <span data-start="375950">Your content creation team wants to generate great content</span> <span data-start="379070">for the users to consume.</span> <span data-start="380660">However, they might create images</span> <span data-start="382550">that are too heavy or not optimized</span> <span data-start="384376">because they are not going through the image optimization</span> <span data-start="386750">layer.</span> <span data-start="388100">The marketing team spends several dollars</span> <span data-start="390200">to bring traffic to the site and care deeply</span> <span data-start="392600">about the user experience.</span> <span data-start="394260">However, they might also have tags</span> <span data-start="396740">that are either old or redundant or obsolete.</span> <span data-start="400190">The design team cares very much about that end-to-end</span> <span data-start="403670">experience, but they might have some really cool new features</span> <span data-start="407660">that do not use shared competence.</span> <span data-start="410210">In each of these scenarios, one thing</span> <span data-start="412610">is clear, which is that performance</span> <span data-start="414890">needs to be a priority among every team that</span> <span data-start="418310">affects the website and cares about user experience.</span> <span data-start="423160">Let's look at two approaches, a top-down</span> <span data-start="425490">and a bottom-up approach, in order</span> <span data-start="427200">to create organizational alignment.</span> <span data-start="429540">And we'll do this using two examples of partners,</span> <span data-start="432360">1-800-Flowers, which is a global flower brand, and then</span> <span data-start="435810">JustFly, which is a Canadian travel agency.</span> <span data-start="439910">1-800-Flowers believed that the modern marketing department</span> <span data-start="443660">is really marketing plus technology.</span> <span data-start="446420">This is a very big shift in mindset.</span> <span data-start="449840">And what they did was to break out of organizational silos</span> <span data-start="454490">and create a cross-functional team that</span> <span data-start="456920">comprised of product, marketing, design</span> <span data-start="459680">development, and analytics.</span> <span data-start="461540">This was led by the CMO of the company.</span> <span data-start="464480">And they were given a very clear shared goal,</span> <span data-start="468270">which was to drive growth for the company</span> <span data-start="470930">by investing in the emerging product experiences.</span> <span data-start="475250">This allowed this cross-functional team</span> <span data-start="477200">to work really closely to invest not just in one or two,</span> <span data-start="481160">but almost the entire spectrum of modern web technologies.</span> <span data-start="484910">And as you can see, this yielded some great results.</span> <span data-start="488420">Seeing a 50% uplift in conversions does not come easy.</span> <span data-start="493540">Let's look at the other example, JustFly.</span> <span data-start="496900">Even if you don't have a top-down mandate,</span> <span data-start="499390">you can use data to kind of prove your case</span> <span data-start="502510">and get that consensus.</span> <span data-start="504490">JustFly did just that.</span> <span data-start="507260">They started off with bite-sized proof of concepts</span> <span data-start="511030">and experiments and got the consensus</span> <span data-start="513789">amongst their management and cross-functional teams</span> <span data-start="516280">to invest in a [INAUDIBLE].</span> <span data-start="519070">They started off with this high-level goal</span> <span data-start="520990">of improving the booking experience on their site.</span> <span data-start="524200">And they used data and experiments</span> <span data-start="526120">for just about everything, from testing different GSA libraries</span> <span data-start="530290">to testing different checkout flows and design.</span> <span data-start="533770">And also, they had [? at ?] [? the ?] [? home ?]</span> <span data-start="536320">[? screen ?] icon being [INAUDIBLE] by a few users</span> <span data-start="538870">to see how those users behave differently from others.</span> <span data-start="542650">And with all of this data, they not only</span> <span data-start="544840">got the buy-in from product and marketing,</span> <span data-start="547570">but they also got the head count they needed to build the PWA.</span> <span data-start="551260">And they merged the code bases of two of their brands</span> <span data-start="554470">so that they could launch both of them</span> <span data-start="556210">as a PWA in the same time frame that it</span> <span data-start="558800">would have taken for one.</span> <span data-start="560410">Now, that's efficiency.</span> <span data-start="562010">And as you can see, with a 35% improvement in bookings,</span> <span data-start="566050">this is a great result for them.</span> <span data-start="569290">All in all, whether you use a top-down approach</span> <span data-start="571540">or a bottom-up approach, it's important to keep in mind</span> <span data-start="574540">that organizational alignment is key to not just prioritizing</span> <span data-start="578740">your performance projects, but also to gain</span> <span data-start="580990">the right visibility so that everybody</span> <span data-start="583330">that cares about user experience also cares about your project.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="587680"><span class="speaker">Cheney Tsai</span>: Well, once you get the organizational buy-in,</span> <span data-start="590830">you still have to build the project.</span> <span data-start="593140">So we're not here today to talk about all different ways</span> <span data-start="595660">to build a great Progressive Web App or a modern web experience.</span> <span data-start="599530">We'll share a little bit of these successful traits</span> <span data-start="602140">we see of good projects we see out there.</span> <span data-start="604660">One big pattern is that we see success</span> <span data-start="608260">in having a long-term vision and then</span> <span data-start="610420">having achievable goals towards that vision.</span> <span data-start="613420">To give an example — </span> <span data-start="614420">so I was recently in Spain with my wife,</span> <span data-start="616120">and we visited la Sagrada Familia over in Barcelona.</span> <span data-start="618884">I think it's a great example of this.</span> <span data-start="620425">This has been under construction for five generations.</span> <span data-start="623500">And yet, it still adheres to the original architect,</span> <span data-start="626530">Gaudi's, original vision.</span> <span data-start="628300">Despite that, even though it's still</span> <span data-start="630190">under construction to this day, it opens its doors</span> <span data-start="632680">to 2.5 million tourists a year.</span> <span data-start="634206">It's actually very much like some of the e-commerce sites</span> <span data-start="636580">that you have.</span> <span data-start="637990">On Black Friday, not only are people going to check out,</span> <span data-start="640960">you probably are running like 2.5 million A/B tests</span> <span data-start="644950">through some platform.</span> <span data-start="646594">So I think it's really interesting</span> <span data-start="648010">to think about that.</span> <span data-start="649190">And a lot of teams have that long-term vision,</span> <span data-start="651910">and they often tell me that, yeah, we</span> <span data-start="653590">want to get that time-to-interactive</span> <span data-start="655570">to under five seconds.</span> <span data-start="657100">But oftentimes, you find yourself,</span> <span data-start="659170">we ran Lighthouse and we're really far away from it.</span> <span data-start="661540">And what happens is, well, we'll get there someday.</span> <span data-start="665570">And then there's nothing achievable to get there.</span> <span data-start="667840">It's just something you see off in the distance in the horizon.</span> <span data-start="670660">Oftentimes, they come back and say, well, we're just</span> <span data-start="672400">going to have short-term goals.</span> <span data-start="673870">And this is great.</span> <span data-start="674810">They have sprints or everything to get quick wins.</span> <span data-start="677110">And not to say quick wins aren't bad,</span> <span data-start="679180">but oftentimes, you kind of get into this internal cycle of,</span> <span data-start="682400">well, there's a deadline here.</span> <span data-start="683660">It's something we can achieve before the holiday season.</span> <span data-start="686245">And then that's all you do.</span> <span data-start="687370">You go in the circles or you regress after it a little bit.</span> <span data-start="691070">It's really important that you have both a long-term vision</span> <span data-start="694240">and a short-term goal and you make</span> <span data-start="696250">sure that they are actually related,</span> <span data-start="697940">that the short-term goals is making meaningful progress</span> <span data-start="700900">towards a long-term vision.</span> <span data-start="702799">Let's make this a little bit more concrete.</span> <span data-start="704590">We all like to say it up on the stage with the other speakers</span> <span data-start="707131">that one of the visions is to improve speed.</span> <span data-start="710030">Obviously, what does that mean?</span> <span data-start="712040">There's a lot different ways to measure.</span> <span data-start="713720">So let's go back to what I was saying earlier from a user</span> <span data-start="716230">perspective.</span> <span data-start="717070">Improving speed might be to focus on user navigations.</span> <span data-start="720940">So when we say you want to optimize your cold page load,</span> <span data-start="724000">or maybe your return page load to see if you're using caching,</span> <span data-start="728260">or if you're comparing single-page app</span> <span data-start="730150">to multi-page app, a lot of things</span> <span data-start="732070">we're talking about that ease, that latency between me</span> <span data-start="735070">clicking on the user interface and the response</span> <span data-start="737440">in your UI of something showing up.</span> <span data-start="739210">So let's talk about speed in that regard.</span> <span data-start="741560">So to go back to the house really quickly,</span> <span data-start="744250">I think doors are a great kind of example</span> <span data-start="746800">of what navigation is.</span> <span data-start="748110">An e-commerce site —  it's like a house.</span> <span data-start="749800">You move from room to room.</span> <span data-start="751247">You might come in through the back door, the front door,</span> <span data-start="753580">or something like that.</span> <span data-start="754720">And throughout the process, to complete</span> <span data-start="756580">the journey in the house, like to complete the journey</span> <span data-start="758830">on your website, you move from room to room.</span> <span data-start="761020">On Thanksgiving, you're holding the hot turkey in the kitchen.</span> <span data-start="764590">Do you want to mess around with the door on the left</span> <span data-start="767590">here where you have to find one key</span> <span data-start="769300">and then grab another key to get through the door in the back?</span> <span data-start="771883">It's probably not the door you want.</span> <span data-start="773590">Likewise, there are probably experiences</span> <span data-start="775420">in your e-commerce journey where you don't want the user</span> <span data-start="777753">during sorting, filtering, or searching</span> <span data-start="779800">to have to kind of pay the cost of that locked door.</span> <span data-start="783160">There might be a good place for you to have a door on the right</span> <span data-start="785890">here.</span> <span data-start="786460">I'm not saying that it's always client-side routing or anything</span> <span data-start="788560">like that, but there are different techniques of making</span> <span data-start="790851">that as seamless as possible.</span> <span data-start="792700">So let's jump into three examples from Walmart, eBay,</span> <span data-start="795600">and Airbnb, who are in different parts of this modern web</span> <span data-start="798030">journey, and kind of dive into how they're breaking down</span> <span data-start="800760">this process.</span> <span data-start="801930">Walmart's a great example — </span> <span data-start="803790">extremely leading e-commerce site,</span> <span data-start="806040">and it recently made a North Star Goal to reduce time</span> <span data-start="809550">to interactive by 70% on low-end devices,</span> <span data-start="812340">such as the iPhone 6s and Moto G4.</span> <span data-start="815311">And this is an extremely aggressive goal to going back</span> <span data-start="817560">to what I was saying earlier.</span> <span data-start="818890">But I liked that they were able to kind of make that goal.</span> <span data-start="821590">So they organized a bunch of product and engineering teams</span> <span data-start="824222">to make meaningful progress towards that.</span> <span data-start="825930">And then in the last couple of months, they got 25% of the way</span> <span data-start="829200">there with improvement on some pages.</span> <span data-start="831480">But just because you make good progress from 0% to 25%</span> <span data-start="834690">doesn't mean just making quick wins or the same process</span> <span data-start="837940">is going to take you from 25% to 70%.</span> <span data-start="840600">But that work is important because in that work they did,</span> <span data-start="843450">they were able to show significant business</span> <span data-start="845700">improvement and use that to socialize it</span> <span data-start="847860">across their teams.</span> <span data-start="849120">But what do I mean by going from 25% to 75%</span> <span data-start="852150">might not be quite as simple?</span> <span data-start="854490">Take this.</span> <span data-start="855730">It's not really my kind of room, but let's say it is.</span> <span data-start="858060">I could organize this room by just taking some books out,</span> <span data-start="860820">and reshuffling, and making sure they're all in the same order.</span> <span data-start="863684">But if I was going to take that strategy</span> <span data-start="865350">and do that for everything in this room,</span> <span data-start="867100">I don't know if I'll make meaningful progress</span> <span data-start="868974">and finish in time.</span> <span data-start="869970">If I'm going to clean up this room,</span> <span data-start="871020">I might actually say, well, look,</span> <span data-start="872130">this is kind of how I would like one shelf to look like,</span> <span data-start="874320">but let's kind of take all the books away,</span> <span data-start="876110">move the shelves around to actually get</span> <span data-start="877734">a nice looking place.</span> <span data-start="879635">Likewise, what Walmart's doing is that because they</span> <span data-start="881760">had a North Star Goal and they made short-term progress,</span> <span data-start="884392">they're now able to start thinking about, well,</span> <span data-start="886350">what other larger shifts can we take to get</span> <span data-start="888450">to the goal we want to do?</span> <span data-start="889830">Is it building a Progressive Web App?</span> <span data-start="891480">Is it adding service workers in some meaningful way?</span> <span data-start="893647">I think we're really interested to see</span> <span data-start="895229">kind of what they're going to work on in the next year.</span> <span data-start="897840">Speaking of service workers, eBay</span> <span data-start="900450">is actually using one of the service worker techniques</span> <span data-start="902850">to improve user navigation on their site.</span> <span data-start="905670">So in one of the earlier talks, we</span> <span data-start="907710">talked about how you can use service workers</span> <span data-start="909720">to improve user navigations.</span> <span data-start="911250">There's lots of different ways.</span> <span data-start="912790">eBay is just using one potential way,</span> <span data-start="914682">and they're testing this right now.</span> <span data-start="916140">So they're doing predictive prefetching of listing pages.</span> <span data-start="919180">So for example, right now, if I go to eBay, and say,</span> <span data-start="921820">I'm looking for a camera for Christmas for my dad — </span> <span data-start="924400">and dad, you didn't hear that.</span> <span data-start="925650">I don't think you're tuning in.</span> <span data-start="927700">So right now, if I see a camera in the search results,</span> <span data-start="930840">I have to wait until I click on the listing,</span> <span data-start="933750">and then the browser makes another HTML request,</span> <span data-start="936360">and I'm waiting for that as a user.</span> <span data-start="938100">And depending on what connection I'm in,</span> <span data-start="939960">that could take a long time.</span> <span data-start="941760">Well, eBay's like, if we could predict with high accuracy what</span> <span data-start="945809">you're likely to click on —  you're going to click</span> <span data-start="947850">on this camera right here.</span> <span data-start="949440">What if we post message to this service worker</span> <span data-start="951720">that particular file you need.</span> <span data-start="953047">And then the service worker is pulling in the background</span> <span data-start="955380">while I'm considering which camera to click on</span> <span data-start="957360">so that when I do click on it, well,</span> <span data-start="958911">it's already there on my phone so that when I click through,</span> <span data-start="961410">it's as instantaneous of a navigation as possible.</span> <span data-start="965610">Of course, what if you don't have a service worker</span> <span data-start="967800">architecture yet already in place?</span> <span data-start="969420">You're waiting on Q3 for that to be done.</span> <span data-start="972150">Or maybe some of the quick wins for initial page load might not</span> <span data-start="976260">be there and you're kind of stuck there.</span> <span data-start="977970">Because you have a long-term vision of improving user</span> <span data-start="980340">navigation, you might run into a wall at some point</span> <span data-start="983070">of a short-term goal.</span> <span data-start="984210">Because you have that setup, you can</span> <span data-start="985710">start thinking about different ways of getting</span> <span data-start="988200">to that long-term vision.</span> <span data-start="989370">And this is kind of where Airbnb is kind of thinking about.</span> <span data-start="991860">So Airbnb is like, well, sometimes rebooting</span> <span data-start="995400">that JavaScript location on every single page</span> <span data-start="997770">might be a cost we don't want every single page load to be.</span> <span data-start="1000860">So they saw that, what if we can only</span> <span data-start="1003566">update certain parts of the page,</span> <span data-start="1004940">say, in the search results so that only that refreshes, only</span> <span data-start="1007610">that shows up when the user clicks on something?</span> <span data-start="1009710">In doing this, they actually measured</span> <span data-start="1011251">the user-perceived speed of that load.</span> <span data-start="1014050">And they saw that loading the search results</span> <span data-start="1016010">page in that manner was a seven to eight time improvement.</span> <span data-start="1019272">And so let's say they start diverting more user</span> <span data-start="1021230">traffic to take advantage of client-side routing</span> <span data-start="1023930">so that now 88% of search results loads</span> <span data-start="1027230">are leveraging the seven to eight times speed improvement.</span> <span data-start="1029655">Because at the end of the day, it's</span> <span data-start="1031113">the user's journey that matters.</span> <span data-start="1033530">Hopefully this is a quick example</span> <span data-start="1035369">of how you can keep an eye on long-term vision, wherever that</span> <span data-start="1037910">may be, set short-term goals, and realize that there are</span> <span data-start="1040609">a lot of different ways when you hit</span> <span data-start="1042109">different walls in those short-term goals of getting</span> <span data-start="1044810">to that long-term vision.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1047072"><span class="speaker">Ramya Raghavan</span>: Let's talk about the third challenge,</span> <span data-start="1049280">measurement.</span> <span data-start="1050690">Let me ask you something.</span> <span data-start="1052130">Please raise your hands if you've ever</span> <span data-start="1053810">worked on a project with great potential</span> <span data-start="1055940">to improve user experience, but the plug</span> <span data-start="1058700">got pulled at some point because you couldn't prove the impact.</span> <span data-start="1062750">Anyone?</span> <span data-start="1064681">That's quite a few of us.</span> <span data-start="1066590">And this is certainly not uncommon, right?</span> <span data-start="1069530">Even if you have a great organizational alignment</span> <span data-start="1073130">and a good technical approach to your project,</span> <span data-start="1076470">if you don't have the right measurement strategy,</span> <span data-start="1078720">it could still fail.</span> <span data-start="1080697">Because of this, even though this is the third challenge</span> <span data-start="1083030">we are covering here today, this is one of the first things</span> <span data-start="1086120">that I've seen successful companies do</span> <span data-start="1088520">in terms of thinking about their performance project.</span> <span data-start="1092810">A good measurement strategy is one that is shared, automated,</span> <span data-start="1097010">and actionable.</span> <span data-start="1098510">What do I mean by that?</span> <span data-start="1100650">It needs to have shared metrics.</span> <span data-start="1102630">To Cheney's earlier point, when you have the North Star Goal,</span> <span data-start="1106950">you need to have specific metrics that</span> <span data-start="1110960">are mapped to that North Star Goal that are also</span> <span data-start="1114320">shared amongst people that care about that user experience.</span> <span data-start="1118790">Having these shared metrics is really crucial,</span> <span data-start="1122720">and you have to define it in a way</span> <span data-start="1124310">that people understand exactly what those metrics are</span> <span data-start="1127130">and how they are calculated.</span> <span data-start="1129410">The second piece here is automated tools.</span> <span data-start="1132240">These tools are necessary, not just to measure these metrics,</span> <span data-start="1135480">but also monitor them over time so that you can gain</span> <span data-start="1139190">real good insights from them.</span> <span data-start="1141720">And once you have those tools, it's</span> <span data-start="1143270">important to understand, what are the actionable next steps?</span> <span data-start="1146870">Now that I have this insight, what changes</span> <span data-start="1149270">can I make in order to meet that North Star Goal?</span> <span data-start="1152766">Let's dive into shared metrics a little bit deeper because it's</span> <span data-start="1155390">often not as well understood.</span> <span data-start="1158630">When I talk about mapping goals to specific metrics,</span> <span data-start="1162110">we have these four big milestones</span> <span data-start="1164240">when we talk about a user journey in terms</span> <span data-start="1167180">of acquisition, engagement, conversion, and re-engagement.</span> <span data-start="1170480">Let's focus more on the conversion piece.</span> <span data-start="1173240">Let's say you really wanted a seamless checkout experience</span> <span data-start="1176270">for your users.</span> <span data-start="1177650">One way to measure that is to think about the average time</span> <span data-start="1182330">that it takes for, let's say, 90% of your users</span> <span data-start="1186170">to go from that cart page to the order completion page.</span> <span data-start="1191480">Understanding from a user perspective</span> <span data-start="1193490">how easy or difficult it is for them</span> <span data-start="1195500">to convert when that intent is clear</span> <span data-start="1197960">is a good way, potentially, for measuring whether you're having</span> <span data-start="1202460">a seamless checkout flow.</span> <span data-start="1205320">Another important point to consider is third parties.</span> <span data-start="1208740">Third parties are an integral part of that user experience</span> <span data-start="1211950">on your site.</span> <span data-start="1212766">And therefore, they should not be</span> <span data-start="1214140">ignored when it comes to measurement strategy either.</span> <span data-start="1217140">So one way you can hold your third party accountable</span> <span data-start="1219750">is to say that the server response</span> <span data-start="1221400">time should be under a certain budget that you set for them.</span> <span data-start="1225560">All in all, talking about budgets,</span> <span data-start="1227810">you've been hearing this term of performance budgets</span> <span data-start="1231050">throughout various sessions today.</span> <span data-start="1233810">A performance budget is a framework</span> <span data-start="1235670">that allows you to understand what changes represent progress</span> <span data-start="1239180">and what changes represent regressions.</span> <span data-start="1243080">And it does take into account the set of shared metrics,</span> <span data-start="1247040">and you have budgets for each of those metrics, which</span> <span data-start="1250040">are shown in this automated tool and made actionable.</span> <span data-start="1255350">Let's actually take a look at how</span> <span data-start="1256730">three different e-commerce companies</span> <span data-start="1258410">took this idea of a performance budget</span> <span data-start="1261200">and implemented it so well that they</span> <span data-start="1263330">have seen some amazing results.</span> <span data-start="1265470">Are you ready?</span> <span data-start="1267720">OK, Cdiscount is a French leader in e-commerce</span> <span data-start="1272810">that had a problem that is not very unlike many of us</span> <span data-start="1276980">in e-commerce.</span> <span data-start="1278390">They saw a big chunk of their traffic on mobile,</span> <span data-start="1282740">but they didn't see that the mobile sales were</span> <span data-start="1285830">at a similar ratio.</span> <span data-start="1288110">They realized that this is not an easy problem to solve,</span> <span data-start="1290820">right?</span> <span data-start="1291710">So they broke organizational silos,</span> <span data-start="1294080">and they empowered their marketing team</span> <span data-start="1296150">to run deep analysis and come up with a set</span> <span data-start="1298730">of shared best practices.</span> <span data-start="1300950">They then implemented these best practices as budgets</span> <span data-start="1304520">within their tool.</span> <span data-start="1305810">And using the integration between SpeedCurve and Slack,</span> <span data-start="1310730">they ensured that when the budgets were not met,</span> <span data-start="1313460">automatic alerts would be sent into the Slack channel which</span> <span data-start="1316550">was shared amongst all the cross-functional teams.</span> <span data-start="1319790">By collaborating in making all of these different changes,</span> <span data-start="1323190">they saw some really, really good results.</span> <span data-start="1326490">Their mobile website conversion rate</span> <span data-start="1329090">was 50% higher than their native app, which has a 4,</span> <span data-start="1333090">4 and 1/2 star in different app stores.</span> <span data-start="1336780">This is something that all of us really can relate to, right?</span> <span data-start="1340680">It's not easy to get there.</span> <span data-start="1343960">Let's take another example.</span> <span data-start="1345930">Carousell, which is a Singapore-based online</span> <span data-start="1351390">marketplace, used this idea of a performance budget because they</span> <span data-start="1356700">really wanted their users in southeast Asian countries where</span> <span data-start="1360720">the predominant network speed is 3G — </span> <span data-start="1364290">they wanted all of those users to have a great experience</span> <span data-start="1368220">on their site.</span> <span data-start="1370020">And so they started off with this kind</span> <span data-start="1371790">of performance budget.</span> <span data-start="1373230">Note that the first line here is about the critical rendering</span> <span data-start="1377280">path resources bundle to be under 120 KB.</span> <span data-start="1383010">This is irrespective of whether that bundle includes</span> <span data-start="1385770">first party or third party because they</span> <span data-start="1387540">had this commitment that that bundle needs</span> <span data-start="1390150">to be really small.</span> <span data-start="1393370">They were so intent upon following this performance</span> <span data-start="1396450">budget that they included this as part</span> <span data-start="1398550">of their continuous integration process, such</span> <span data-start="1401010">that the code could not be merged</span> <span data-start="1402930">until this bundle or this budget was met.</span> <span data-start="1407820">In order to do that, it was not an easy thing at all,</span> <span data-start="1410660">so they really had to collaborate very, very</span> <span data-start="1413040">closely with their design, and marketing, and analytics teams,</span> <span data-start="1416910">and that really paid off very well, as you</span> <span data-start="1419550">can see in this next slide.</span> <span data-start="1421500">Not only are these metrics really good,</span> <span data-start="1423450">but there's something here for every team that</span> <span data-start="1426030">was part of this project.</span> <span data-start="1427860">The product team cares about the page load time.</span> <span data-start="1430920">The marketing team cared about organic traffic.</span> <span data-start="1434580">The ads team cared about the click-through rates.</span> <span data-start="1437160">And the transactions team cared about how many</span> <span data-start="1439290">buyers and sellers were able to chat with each other</span> <span data-start="1441960">to complete their transaction.</span> <span data-start="1443800">So these were great results all in all.</span> <span data-start="1447330">Let's look at a third example.</span> <span data-start="1449120">As you heard earlier today about Wayfair, the home goods company</span> <span data-start="1452600">here in the US, that really wanted</span> <span data-start="1455420">to improve user experience and make sure that they</span> <span data-start="1458900">sustained that improvement.</span> <span data-start="1462510">When they first started off with the performance budget, which</span> <span data-start="1465300">they said was one of the most crucial parts</span> <span data-start="1468060">of the measurement that they did,</span> <span data-start="1470970">it did not take off that much because these budgets were</span> <span data-start="1474540">understood, but it was not very clear for everybody.</span> <span data-start="1478410">Well, they made so many changes towards optimizing</span> <span data-start="1481470">their [? inside, ?] they said that one</span> <span data-start="1483180">of the most important things they did</span> <span data-start="1485280">was to socialize their budget.</span> <span data-start="1488230">And the way they did that was to make it clear</span> <span data-start="1490900">using performance indicators, as you see here in colors.</span> <span data-start="1494720">So this is how it worked.</span> <span data-start="1496400">They had a budget, and they had an acceptable variance of plus</span> <span data-start="1499330">or minus 10%.</span> <span data-start="1500720">So if you were within that range, you're in orange.</span> <span data-start="1504590">If you exceed that budget by more than 10%,</span> <span data-start="1507310">then you enter the red area.</span> <span data-start="1509800">And if you're better than the budget by more than 10%,</span> <span data-start="1512297">then you've hit your goal.</span> <span data-start="1513380">Congratulations, you're a green.</span> <span data-start="1515650">They also had a competitor line, just to make things fun.</span> <span data-start="1520720">This is how it looked for all internal users</span> <span data-start="1523270">when they looked at their specific pages</span> <span data-start="1525760">since the budgets were set at a page-type level</span> <span data-start="1529120">for every route in the site.</span> <span data-start="1531760">So the moment you look at your mobile site within the company,</span> <span data-start="1535510">you were able to see these indicators that</span> <span data-start="1538330">told you whether you are in the red, green, or orange.</span> <span data-start="1542970">As you can see here, the way they</span> <span data-start="1544660">set these budgets was the moment you hit the goal reliably,</span> <span data-start="1548970">your budget, and therefore, goal,</span> <span data-start="1550680">which was always 10% better than the budget,</span> <span data-start="1553920">tightened up a little bit.</span> <span data-start="1555240">You can see that over here, where once you hit the goal,</span> <span data-start="1558270">the bar was raised, so to speak, and it actually</span> <span data-start="1562080">tightened up over there.</span> <span data-start="1563760">By the way, isn't this the kind of graph</span> <span data-start="1565650">we all want to see, going from 2.3 seconds to 0.9 seconds?</span> <span data-start="1570000">That's really awesome.</span> <span data-start="1572950">This is a performance portal.</span> <span data-start="1576240">As you can see, in this portal, they</span> <span data-start="1577830">had a clear set of shared metrics.</span> <span data-start="1581100">Not just the metrics, but also the page level indicator,</span> <span data-start="1584820">and they have a call to action at the bottom for users</span> <span data-start="1588150">to basically reach out to a Slack channel</span> <span data-start="1591200">if they had questions about these metrics.</span> <span data-start="1595830">Whether you're trying to use a performance budget idea</span> <span data-start="1599360">or trying to use the general idea of a shared metrics</span> <span data-start="1602780">automated tool and actionable next steps,</span> <span data-start="1606270">thinking about your measurement strategy</span> <span data-start="1608030">at the beginning of your project is</span> <span data-start="1609950">crucial to the success of the project.</span> <span data-start="1613060">Another thing to remember about performance budgets</span> <span data-start="1615770">is that it needs governance to think</span> <span data-start="1618020">about the metrics at a page or route level,</span> <span data-start="1620480">and also to maintain those budgets and metrics as moving</span> <span data-start="1623540">targets as you go forward.</span> <span data-start="1626620">It also needs to be enforced in a way</span> <span data-start="1628800">that everybody can come together to meet or beat those budgets.</span> <span data-start="1633630">And that makes it very, very successful.</span>
