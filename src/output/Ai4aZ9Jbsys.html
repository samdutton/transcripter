<section><span data-start="6953"><span class="speaker">Kinuko Yasuda</span>: Hi, everyone.</span> <span data-start="8119">I'm Kinuko.</span> <span data-start="8950">I'm the tech lead of [INAUDIBLE] projects</span> <span data-start="11260">for the web platform in Chrome.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="12889"><span class="speaker">Rudy Galfi</span>: And I'm Rudy.</span> <span data-start="13930">I'm the lead product manager for AMP at Google.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="16792"><span class="speaker">Kinuko Yasuda</span>: This presentation is</span> <span data-start="18250">a bit of preview of two upcoming APIs, web packaging</span> <span data-start="21460">and portals.</span> <span data-start="22040">With these APIs we believe that you'll</span> <span data-start="24910">be able to take that low friction</span> <span data-start="27160">agent to the next level, and create a zero friction user</span> <span data-start="30310">experience.</span> <span data-start="31780">I hope you like it.</span> <span data-start="32890">Let's dive right into it.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="35470"><span class="speaker">Rudy Galfi</span>: All right, so here's a slide showing a slide.</span> <span data-start="38920">To be more precise, this is one of those old school</span> <span data-start="41620">projector slides.</span> <span data-start="44169">In their day, slides like these were a useful way</span> <span data-start="46210">to communicate, or held important memories for people.</span> <span data-start="49770">To view the slide's content, the projector</span> <span data-start="51520">needed to mechanically position it</span> <span data-start="53290">into place, so that the light source would shine through it.</span> <span data-start="56629">And for those of you who might have watched</span> <span data-start="58420">one of these old school slide shows,</span> <span data-start="59920">you probably remember how tedious</span> <span data-start="61560">it was to progress through each slide.</span> <span data-start="64160">This kind of makes me feel, you know,</span> <span data-start="67150">like how we think about the web today, the same feeling.</span> <span data-start="71310">Just like progressing through cylinder slides, when</span> <span data-start="73590">you browse the web today you can feel all the navigations.</span> <span data-start="84260">Today the web is used a lot on the go,</span> <span data-start="86690">say in between meetings, in an elevator,</span> <span data-start="89620">or maybe you're on a poor connection.</span> <span data-start="91850">When I've got limited time, focused on my phone</span> <span data-start="93950">before the next distraction comes along,</span> <span data-start="96110">spending five seconds or longer staring at a white screen,</span> <span data-start="99540">waiting for the content to come in,</span> <span data-start="101330">for the page to be interactive, that's incredibly noticeable.</span> <span data-start="105799">Many of you may have observed we used</span> <span data-start="107340">some exaggerated long transitions on our own</span> <span data-start="109760">slides so far in this talk.</span> <span data-start="111260">Don't worry.</span> <span data-start="112220">We're going to put an end to that soon.</span> <span data-start="114050">Those were just one second fades.</span> <span data-start="116120">Think of how used to the cycle of reading</span> <span data-start="118650">and then waiting, reading and then waiting,</span> <span data-start="121160">that we've kind of grown used to.</span> <span data-start="123760">We think it's time to do better.</span> <span data-start="125446">And we have some ideas to help you create seamless,</span> <span data-start="127570">zero friction user experiences.</span> <span data-start="129530">And that's what this talk is all about.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="131920"><span class="speaker">Kinuko Yasuda</span>: So our desire to see</span> <span data-start="133460">seamless user experience on the web, it's not new.</span> <span data-start="136600">In Chrome 13 back in 2011, we launched</span> <span data-start="139660">a feature called Instant Search, which provides the search</span> <span data-start="142860">abilities for user experience.</span> <span data-start="145030">It did so by pairing the [INAUDIBLE] user would</span> <span data-start="148480">most likely click on.</span> <span data-start="150160">However, the feature only worked in limited scenarios</span> <span data-start="153310">for various reasons.</span> <span data-start="154570">In particular, for privacy reason</span> <span data-start="157090">it only worked for the search results</span> <span data-start="159310">the user had already visited and for which</span> <span data-start="161680">we had a high confidence of user interest.</span> <span data-start="165240">Then in 2015, another example with [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span data-start="169210">user experience was launched.</span> <span data-start="171100">I'm talking about AMP.</span> <span data-start="173040">Rudy is going to walk us through what it took,</span> <span data-start="175360">and where things are headed.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="177354"><span class="speaker">Rudy Galfi</span>: So as Kinuko said, advancing</span> <span data-start="179020">the state of the art in page loading</span> <span data-start="180520">has always been of intense interest to us at Google,</span> <span data-start="183310">and for Google Search.</span> <span data-start="184480">We point users to a whole lot of web pages.</span> <span data-start="187060">And thinking about the totality of the experience</span> <span data-start="189460">that the user gets, we really want</span> <span data-start="191140">it to feel as fast and as seamless as possible,</span> <span data-start="193720">even as the user goes off of Search</span> <span data-start="196030">and into the whole great world of content</span> <span data-start="197950">that they're looking to explore.</span> <span data-start="199927">When we started AMP, we were intent on using</span> <span data-start="201760">the full power of the web platform that was available.</span> <span data-start="204400">But where we wanted to get was here.</span> <span data-start="206650">And we felt that what we could achieve</span> <span data-start="208270">in a scalable way on the web kind of just got us up to here.</span> <span data-start="213336">So we gave it a bunch of thought,</span> <span data-start="214710">and came up with an architecture for instant loading</span> <span data-start="217320">that could work on today's web.</span> <span data-start="219030">It's still what we use today.</span> <span data-start="220740">First, there's the AMP JavaScript library.</span> <span data-start="223140">It helps to ensure that the experience is fast by default.</span> <span data-start="226590">And this is enforced by a validation step, which</span> <span data-start="228870">helps keep the experience fast, even</span> <span data-start="230460">as the site is getting updated.</span> <span data-start="232710">The next layer was thinking about how server response</span> <span data-start="236070">times can vary a lot globally.</span> <span data-start="237930">And not every site is situated on great infrastructure.</span> <span data-start="241290">Also, as we've seen earlier, sticking huge images</span> <span data-start="243900">into pages intended for mobile viewing is still pretty common.</span> <span data-start="246977">And so for these reasons we added the second layer</span> <span data-start="249060">of caching, where we can ensure that the content is</span> <span data-start="252150">pushed to the edges of the network for faster delivery.</span> <span data-start="255000">And we can do common sense optimizations.</span> <span data-start="257730">And last, truly the best thing we</span> <span data-start="259879">can do to get load times down to zero</span> <span data-start="261420">milliseconds is to prerender the content,</span> <span data-start="264050">use our psychic powers.</span> <span data-start="266010">As we just discussed, this was attempted in Search before</span> <span data-start="269340">with Instant Search.</span> <span data-start="270190">However, you need to think really</span> <span data-start="272370">carefully about the privacy implications of such a design.</span> <span data-start="275520">And we had trouble scaling it.</span> <span data-start="277980">The cache will actually help us complement this prerendering</span> <span data-start="280770">very well.</span> <span data-start="281670">And Kinuko will explain more about that in a moment.</span> <span data-start="285650">So we got all of this stood up.</span> <span data-start="286990">And this is where we ended up.</span> <span data-start="289312">Most of what you're looking at here</span> <span data-start="290770">is what we call the AMP viewer.</span> <span data-start="292210">That's the page you're visiting.</span> <span data-start="294470">It's responsible for displaying the content served</span> <span data-start="296850">through the AMP cache for speed and privacy reasons.</span> <span data-start="299764">However, you'll notice by looking at the address bar</span> <span data-start="301930">that the URL is still saying google.com in it.</span> <span data-start="305110">To help the user understand where</span> <span data-start="307060">the content they're viewing came from,</span> <span data-start="308830">we had to add an extra piece of UX</span> <span data-start="310650">to the top of the content area of the page.</span> <span data-start="313480">The idea of the instant loading was achieved.</span> <span data-start="315490">But the design constraints that we faced</span> <span data-start="317530">and the work arounds that we had to build for them ended up</span> <span data-start="320500">being put on full display in the product experience,</span> <span data-start="323530">and that wasn't great.</span> <span data-start="325390">So we hear a bunch of feedback on this, maybe even</span> <span data-start="327940">from some of you.</span> <span data-start="329320">So earlier this year we started down</span> <span data-start="330820">this path to make the URLs for AMP pages better.</span> <span data-start="334580">And after having AMP in the wild for two years,</span> <span data-start="337180">we decided it was time to take all that we had learned</span> <span data-start="339767">and develop the necessary primitives in the web platform</span> <span data-start="342100">directly.</span> <span data-start="343040">So we could make all the content across the web</span> <span data-start="345670">be able to benefit from this kind of technology.</span> <span data-start="348947">So this means that for the cases where</span> <span data-start="350530">you click on a link in Search and it's just</span> <span data-start="352720">a simple navigation, then we want the publisher's URL</span> <span data-start="355414">to be the one that shows up in the browser's address</span> <span data-start="357580">bar, while still having the instant, or nearly instant,</span> <span data-start="360580">loading experience.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="364315"><span class="speaker">Kinuko Yasuda</span>: So Rudy talked a lot about the</span> <span data-start="366190">how AMP has been pushing with the goal of highly</span> <span data-start="368830">optimized user experience.</span> <span data-start="371470">There was a lot of special handling required because</span> <span data-start="374130">of a gap in the web platform.</span> <span data-start="376720">We are now taking inspiration from past efforts,</span> <span data-start="379420">like AMP and the Instant Search, and trying</span> <span data-start="381790">to eliminate this gap by extending the web platform.</span> <span data-start="386330">And by doing so, we also want to enable this zero friction user</span> <span data-start="390100">experience across all content on the web.</span> <span data-start="395050">We are working on multiple proposals to achieve this goal.</span> <span data-start="398380">But in this talk, we'll introduce two new [INAUDIBLE],,</span> <span data-start="401370">web packaging and portals.</span> <span data-start="403880">So let me start with web packaging.</span> <span data-start="406560">As the name implies, it's meant for packaging</span> <span data-start="409570">a piece of web content.</span> <span data-start="411220">We think it will enable various interesting use cases.</span> <span data-start="414280">But let me start first explaining</span> <span data-start="417250">how it can help instant navigation both for AMP</span> <span data-start="420310">and non-AMP content.</span> <span data-start="423130">So stepping back, [INAUDIBLE] wanted to make web content</span> <span data-start="427440">load instantly and reliably.</span> <span data-start="430500">Here's why it's hard.</span> <span data-start="432240">When you publish something on the web,</span> <span data-start="434970">in the simplest setting, you'd have a server.</span> <span data-start="437760">And your content would be a project there.</span> <span data-start="440280">Then someone browses your content.</span> <span data-start="442680">But the server might be overloaded.</span> <span data-start="445310">And your content will load slowly.</span> <span data-start="448520">Then the experience not good.</span> <span data-start="450730">So what could we do to improve this?</span> <span data-start="452880">One way would be to prefetch your content.</span> <span data-start="455880">Suppose that your content's linked from a popular traffic</span> <span data-start="458880">source site.</span> <span data-start="460080">When a user visits the site, it can trigger a prefetch</span> <span data-start="463090">when it thinks that the user is about to visit your content.</span> <span data-start="467120">Then because the content is already in the user's cache,</span> <span data-start="470790">the navigations happen very fast.</span> <span data-start="474530">Unfortunately, the prefetched websites</span> <span data-start="476610">can learn about the user's interest,</span> <span data-start="479700">even if they don't visit the website.</span> <span data-start="484260">One way to fix this would be for the referral site</span> <span data-start="487680">to add a cache here.</span> <span data-start="490160">Then the referral site could bootstrap the [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span data-start="493170">in a privacy-preserving manner, because it</span> <span data-start="496100">could let the browser prefetch your content from this cache.</span> <span data-start="500640">This fixed the privacy concern and the content loads</span> <span data-start="503840">instantly.</span> <span data-start="504750">So is this the holy grail?</span> <span data-start="509190">No, not yet.</span> <span data-start="510390">As already explained, this design</span> <span data-start="512309">ends up in full display in the product.</span> <span data-start="515730">The browser's address bar shows the URL</span> <span data-start="517620">of the referral site instead of the UI's because this</span> <span data-start="521669">is where the browser thinks the content is coming from.</span> <span data-start="525040">This is confusing to the users.</span> <span data-start="528450">The issue is that the web platform</span> <span data-start="530460">doesn't provide a proper way to let others bootstrap your page</span> <span data-start="534480">loads.</span> <span data-start="535470">But what if your render critical resources</span> <span data-start="538020">could be shared with popular traffic sources,</span> <span data-start="541530">and [INAUDIBLE] on your behalf.</span> <span data-start="544390">This would let traffic source bootstrap [INAUDIBLE]..</span> <span data-start="546990">And when the user navigates, it's</span> <span data-start="548770">just a regular page load from your servers, only much faster.</span> <span data-start="554290">So how can we achieve this?</span> <span data-start="556440">The browser needs a way to verify</span> <span data-start="559080">the true origin of resources that</span> <span data-start="560900">are served by a fast cache.</span> <span data-start="563130">This can be done by adding a proof of origin</span> <span data-start="566610">on these resources, which is exactly</span> <span data-start="569100">what web packaging provides.</span> <span data-start="571120">So let's see the actual standard proposals.</span> <span data-start="574380">Web packaging is not the name of a single proposal,</span> <span data-start="577710">but an umbrella concept for multiple spec proposals.</span> <span data-start="581370">The most important one is Signed Exchange.</span> <span data-start="583860">It's basically a format that represents a single HTTP</span> <span data-start="587040">exchange, or a pair with HTTP request/response.</span> <span data-start="590760">Very simple, except that it's digitally</span> <span data-start="593430">signed so that the browser can verify the origin of resource.</span> <span data-start="598140">There's another proposal building</span> <span data-start="599760">on top of Signed Exchange called the Bundled Exchange.</span> <span data-start="602910">This is a bundle of exchanges.</span> <span data-start="604860">Therefore it can represent multiple resources</span> <span data-start="607470">in one package, like a whole web page.</span> <span data-start="610380">We think that the Bundled Exchange</span> <span data-start="612030">will enable other interesting use cases,</span> <span data-start="614930">while we start to do the Signed Exchange,</span> <span data-start="617070">since that's the key building block.</span> <span data-start="619440">And after a year of work, we are pleased to announce</span> <span data-start="623490">that we are starting an on-prem experiment</span> <span data-start="625480">of the feature on Chrome 71, which is in beta now.</span> <span data-start="629730">You can play locally with it by enabling a flag,</span> <span data-start="632820">or can join the experiment to enable it on your site.</span> <span data-start="636630">Please visit bit.ly/try-sxg to find out how.</span> <span data-start="643110">We'd love to get your feedback on this.</span> <span data-start="645300">That will help us improve this feature more quickly.</span> <span data-start="650070">So in order to create published Signed Exchanges</span> <span data-start="653380">for your resources, you need to first acquire</span> <span data-start="656200">a certificate that can sign exchanges and host it</span> <span data-start="660460">at a public URL.</span> <span data-start="661780">Such a certificate can be created at DigiCert today.</span> <span data-start="665440">Once you do that, you can generate</span> <span data-start="667060">Signed Exchanges for your resources</span> <span data-start="669370">by using an open-source tool.</span> <span data-start="671470">This process is very manual.</span> <span data-start="673600">But we'll talk about the options later in this talk.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="842820"><span class="speaker">Rustam Lalkaka</span>: Sure.</span> <span data-start="843270">Thanks, Sumo.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="843870"><span class="speaker">Sumantro Das</span>: Cheers.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="845404"><span class="speaker">Rustam Lalkaka</span>: So let's look under the covers</span> <span data-start="847320">and talk about how you would actually deploy something</span> <span data-start="849569">to support Signed Exchange.</span> <span data-start="851370">So at the top here in green we have the request flow</span> <span data-start="854940">from your origin through a front end</span> <span data-start="856890">proxy to your user's device.</span> <span data-start="859790">On the bottom, you have the request flow</span> <span data-start="861570">into the AMP cache.</span> <span data-start="864090">And in between you have an AMP packager.</span> <span data-start="866730">This prepares the documents for the cache</span> <span data-start="869130">and signs them to support Signed Exchange.</span> <span data-start="872400">Now at Cloudflare, we sat down and thought</span> <span data-start="874830">about how to use our global programmable network</span> <span data-start="877410">to make this all simpler.</span> <span data-start="879300">And this is what we ended up with.</span> <span data-start="881040">We took all the logic necessary to support Signed Exchange</span> <span data-start="883830">and built it into a Cloudflare worker.</span> <span data-start="885840">This sits at our edge and supports</span> <span data-start="887730">both the cryptographic operations, the packaging</span> <span data-start="890010">operations, and the logic necessary to arbitrate</span> <span data-start="893100">between the user and AMP cache request flows.</span> <span data-start="896500">So you might be asking, what's a worker?</span> <span data-start="898830">And simply put, it's V8 running on the edge.</span> <span data-start="902566">This allows you to write JavaScript targeting</span> <span data-start="904440">the service workers API, deploy it to our edge,</span> <span data-start="907110">and have it running instantly in 155 locations.</span> <span data-start="911040">Supporting Signed Exchange and this packaging experience</span> <span data-start="913440">is a great example of what Workers is capable of.</span> <span data-start="916500">So in addition to releasing the code that</span> <span data-start="918535">supports this demo, so that you can all</span> <span data-start="920160">build your own Workers to try Signed Exchange,</span> <span data-start="923820">we also plan on building a full fledged Cloudflare feature</span> <span data-start="926610">to support it at launch.</span> <span data-start="928511">Cool.</span> <span data-start="929010">Back to Rudy.</span> <span data-start="930518">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="932015">[APPLAUSE]</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="936506"><span class="speaker">Rudy Galfi</span>: All right, thank you, Sumo and Rustam.</span> <span data-start="939540">So if you're publishing AMP content,</span> <span data-start="941070">we'd like to invite you to try out a developer preview</span> <span data-start="943320">of Signed Exchange AMP content in Search using</span> <span data-start="946955">the instructions at the link up on the slide,</span> <span data-start="948830">g.co/webpackagepreview.</span> <span data-start="951030">You can learn more about creating packages and building</span> <span data-start="953490">an end-to-end flow, like you just saw,</span> <span data-start="955239">for your own AMP content.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="959820"><span class="speaker">Kinuko Yasuda</span>: [INAUDIBLE] will we be seeing the benefits</span> <span data-start="962240">that Signed Exchanges bring to AMP publishers.</span> <span data-start="965300">But it's important not to forget that this will also benefit</span> <span data-start="969020">all pages on the web too.</span> <span data-start="971330">Now, I want to show an additional example</span> <span data-start="973460">of regular cross navigation.</span> <span data-start="975260">On a slow network, the content will load slowly.</span> <span data-start="978320">On the other hand, the right side</span> <span data-start="980670">shows how it can be done with a prefetch with web packaging.</span> <span data-start="984110">You can see that the user is navigated</span> <span data-start="986560">to a page on a different site instantly.</span> <span data-start="989650">The prefetch is down from the cache of the referral site.</span> <span data-start="992690">So they are [INAUDIBLE] in a privacy-preserving manner.</span> <span data-start="996860">So [INAUDIBLE] how to use the web</span> <span data-start="998790">packaging to realize privacy-preserving instant</span> <span data-start="1001660">navigations.</span> <span data-start="1003646">But you know, we're still doing navigation, right?</span> <span data-start="1007020">So it still feels like we're progressing</span> <span data-start="1009340">through pages at a disjoined experience,</span> <span data-start="1012720">not a nice, seamless experience.</span> <span data-start="1015780">And we've been wondering how we could improve this</span> <span data-start="1017970">even further.</span> <span data-start="1019770">And let me introduce our latest proposal, portals.</span> <span data-start="1024250">So let's see what we mean by navigation versus transition.</span> <span data-start="1027869">Maybe it's not too surprising.</span> <span data-start="1029730">Again, this shows regular navigation.</span> <span data-start="1031980">This loads slowly, depending on connectivity.</span> <span data-start="1034319">And it breaks users flow.</span> <span data-start="1036450">And the right side shows an example of a transition.</span> <span data-start="1040020">As you can see, when the user taps on the article,</span> <span data-start="1042829">a nice and seamless animation is triggered,</span> <span data-start="1045540">creating a sense of continuity.</span> <span data-start="1048050">The navigation just happened without being</span> <span data-start="1050490">felt. The navigation [INAUDIBLE] that it's worth</span> <span data-start="1054840">taking a closer look and can be seen from the address bar.</span> <span data-start="1059400">So user starts their journey from a page on feed.glitch.me.</span> <span data-start="1063540">And when the animations are finished,</span> <span data-start="1065730">the user ends on another website, news.horo.jp.</span> <span data-start="1069610">So it's a cross-site transition.</span> <span data-start="1071880">Combining portals and the Signed Exchanges</span> <span data-start="1074100">enables these types of user experience,</span> <span data-start="1077640">while preserving the user's privacy.</span> <span data-start="1081400">It might not be interesting yet.</span> <span data-start="1083170">But portals are not limited to cross-website navigations.</span> <span data-start="1086380">Let's take a look at how it can improve the user</span> <span data-start="1088780">experience of a single website built with multiple page</span> <span data-start="1092680">architecture.</span> <span data-start="1093880">I'd like to thank Hatena at Yeung Jump Web</span> <span data-start="1096265">Comics, our partners in Japan, who</span> <span data-start="1098305">we worked with to create this early exploration</span> <span data-start="1101830">for their reading manga on the go website</span> <span data-start="1104360">called the [INAUDIBLE].</span> <span data-start="1107558">So let's see the user experience without portals.</span> <span data-start="1111520">When you reach the end of a chapter,</span> <span data-start="1113770">you see an instance to [INAUDIBLE]..</span> <span data-start="1115750">As you can see, it takes time to load the next chapter.</span> <span data-start="1120940">That's because the website is using multiple page</span> <span data-start="1123610">architecture.</span> <span data-start="1124450">And it needs to load a new page for each chapter.</span> <span data-start="1129180">Now, let's see how that could look like with portals.</span> <span data-start="1132510">At the end of a chapter, we can prelaunch the next chapter.</span> <span data-start="1135480">It makes the transition seamless.</span> <span data-start="1138600">Pretty cool, right?</span> <span data-start="1142730">The beauty of this is that you can have this smooth user</span> <span data-start="1145910">experience without having to re-architect</span> <span data-start="1149360">your website into single page app, which is,</span> <span data-start="1152000">as you know, a non-trivial amount of work.</span> <span data-start="1155450">So what are portals?</span> <span data-start="1157310">Portals are like iframes.</span> <span data-start="1159440">You can create one as an embed element</span> <span data-start="1161570">of a page using a portal tag.</span> <span data-start="1163850">At this point, it looks pretty much the same as an iframe,</span> <span data-start="1167390">and then navigate to an element by calling an activate API.</span> <span data-start="1172190">When that API is called, the element</span> <span data-start="1174620">is detached from the page and becomes the new top-level page.</span> <span data-start="1179000">You can also add an animation to smooth out the transition.</span> <span data-start="1184670">So what are the differences between portals and iframes?</span> <span data-start="1187570">The biggest difference is that portals can be navigated into.</span> <span data-start="1192830">And as I understand the differences,</span> <span data-start="1194620">the portals are always created as top-level browsing context,</span> <span data-start="1198224">whereas as it can still be embedded</span> <span data-start="1199682">in a page like iframes.</span> <span data-start="1202300">Let's recap the benefits.</span> <span data-start="1203620">Portals enable seamless page transitions,</span> <span data-start="1206530">like what you get with single page apps,</span> <span data-start="1208930">but without having to re-architect your site,</span> <span data-start="1211630">and even across different origins.</span> <span data-start="1214640">So you can just build you website using multiple pages,</span> <span data-start="1217420">and can connect them with portals.</span> <span data-start="1220860">So here's the example of code snippet of portals.</span> <span data-start="1223810">You can create a portal as an HTML element,</span> <span data-start="1227080">and then can append it to the page to help it embed.</span> <span data-start="1230500">Then when the user touches the embedded portal,</span> <span data-start="1233320">you can show a nice animation.</span> <span data-start="1235480">And the calls activate the API to make the actual transition.</span> <span data-start="1239730">That's it.</span> <span data-start="1242290">Exciting, isn't it?</span> <span data-start="1246500">And you probably want to know the current status.</span> <span data-start="1248960">We have an explainer on GitHub.</span> <span data-start="1250770">Visit bit.ly/portals-spec to learn more.</span> <span data-start="1255310">Chrome implementation is in progress.</span> <span data-start="1257590">We are aiming for an origin trial next year,</span> <span data-start="1259930">and are eagerly awaiting your feedback that will</span> <span data-start="1262900">help us refine this proposal.</span> <span data-start="1265960">So that's basically all from us about low friction</span> <span data-start="1268540">to zero friction.</span> <span data-start="1269380">But I have one more topic, Bundled Exchanges.</span> <span data-start="1272940">So remember that we hinted at Bundled Exchanges earlier?</span> <span data-start="1277020">They allow multiple resources to be bundled in one package.</span> <span data-start="1280870">And you might be wondering about the kind</span> <span data-start="1284050">of status of the development.</span> <span data-start="1286260">So while the Chrome team has started building a prototype</span> <span data-start="1290080">to explore the possibilities, we think</span> <span data-start="1292880">this could enable interesting use case</span> <span data-start="1295480">scenarios, like offering PWA installation, and much more.</span> <span data-start="1299530">Here's an example up at News-Reader PWA.</span> <span data-start="1302740">This is based on [INAUDIBLE] read up</span> <span data-start="1305050">built by one of our awesome [INAUDIBLE] folks,</span> <span data-start="1308180">and now runs on a custom Chrome build to use Bundled Exchanges.</span> <span data-start="1311870">The app allows the user to read a news site in a reliable way</span> <span data-start="1316790">by letting [INAUDIBLE] circle download</span> <span data-start="1318720">and save the articles as bundles,</span> <span data-start="1321490">if the news site provides them, so that the user can later</span> <span data-start="1324820">read the saved articles from multiple sites,</span> <span data-start="1327730">even while offline.</span> <span data-start="1329620">Notice that the articles are still</span> <span data-start="1331120">shown as coming from the original news sites.</span> <span data-start="1333580">And the sites keep maintaining the control over them.</span> <span data-start="1337280">Here's another example.</span> <span data-start="1339130">As you may know, loading a large number of resources is costly.</span> <span data-start="1343090">In the bundling of them, in one big JavaScript file</span> <span data-start="1345710">using bundles like webpack is a very popular technique.</span> <span data-start="1349930">We did an experiment to see if Bundled Exchanges can</span> <span data-start="1353050">be used there, which could allow the browser</span> <span data-start="1356080">to process in the cache individual resources</span> <span data-start="1359170">in the bundle, without executing the JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="1362830">And one of our results looked like this.</span> <span data-start="1365290">While still preliminary, it looks promising, we think.</span> <span data-start="1368880">So we think there's some potential</span> <span data-start="1370782">and want to know what you think.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1374234"><span class="speaker">Rudy Galfi</span>: All right, so let's go back to the main topic,</span> <span data-start="1376650">and wrap up this talk.</span> <span data-start="1378570">So we talked about two new proposals for zero friction</span> <span data-start="1381330">user experiences.</span> <span data-start="1382890">First, web packaging enables privacy-preserving instant</span> <span data-start="1385800">navigations.</span> <span data-start="1387060">And second, portals enable seamless transitions</span> <span data-start="1389910">between pages or sites.</span> <span data-start="1391750">Combined together to enable zero friction page transitions</span> <span data-start="1396090">on top of any web pages, even across origins.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1400560"><span class="speaker">Kinuko Yasuda</span>: And here's a look at the roadmap.</span> <span data-start="1402560">Our plan is to ship Signed Exchanges on stable</span> <span data-start="1405290">by the middle of 2019, and also, to start</span> <span data-start="1408180">on origin trial for portals sometime around then, as well.</span> </section>
