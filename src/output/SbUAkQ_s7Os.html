<section><span data-start="6007"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: Hi, and welcome to the day two keynote.</span> <span data-start="8340">My name is Nicole.</span> <span data-start="9300">I'm a PM on the Chrome Web Platform team.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="11807"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Hi, my name is Malte.</span> <span data-start="13140">I work on AMP and JavaScript infrastructure at Google.</span> <span data-start="16120">So actually, this is a little bit awkward today because,</span> <span data-start="18630">for the second keynote — </span> <span data-start="19706">and Ben and [? Dion ?] already talked about, effectively,</span> <span data-start="22080">everything yesterday — </span> <span data-start="23770">so we thought we'd do something slightly different.</span> <span data-start="27010">So normally, at a Chrome Dev Summit keynote,</span> <span data-start="29820">we'd walk through all the new, exciting APIs</span> <span data-start="31830">that the [INAUDIBLE] platform makes available for you.</span> <span data-start="34210">And so we actually are going to do that.</span> <span data-start="36280">But first, we want to talk about something slightly different.</span> <span data-start="39340">We want to talk about web frameworks.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="42109"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: Developers who build for the web often</span> <span data-start="44400">choose to use a framework.</span> <span data-start="46290">In the past, changes to the web platform,</span> <span data-start="48090">didn't necessarily take the frameworks into account,</span> <span data-start="51000">and changes to frameworks didn't necessarily</span> <span data-start="52890">take the web platform into account.</span> <span data-start="54690">We think both the web platform and frameworks benefit</span> <span data-start="58050">from a close collaboration, and so we're</span> <span data-start="59880">out to make that happen.</span> <span data-start="63251">Obviously, if you're building something simple,</span> <span data-start="65209">it makes sense to choose simple technologies.</span> <span data-start="67810">But as soon as an app is sufficiently complex,</span> <span data-start="70300">in most cases, developers choose to use a framework.</span> <span data-start="73900">A few months ago, I put out a very, very methodologically</span> <span data-start="78520">correct Twitter poll, asking people</span> <span data-start="81820">why they choose to use frameworks,</span> <span data-start="83530">and got back a whole bunch of answers.</span> <span data-start="85360">And this one, in particular, sort of</span> <span data-start="87250">resonated with a lot of people.</span> <span data-start="89860">"You can't not use a framework.</span> <span data-start="91690">Your only real choice is to either use</span> <span data-start="93310">one that's open source, documented, tested, supported,</span> <span data-start="96340">maintained, mature and proven" — </span> <span data-start="97810">and I think we'd all throw, you can stack overflow stuff</span> <span data-start="100600">about it into that one.</span> <span data-start="102340">Or the option B is you cobble together some garbage,</span> <span data-start="105670">unmaintainable stuff yourself.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="107410"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: I've made a few of those, actually.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="108790"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: Yeah, I might have</span> <span data-start="109150">made one or to have those in my day before.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="111610"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: And given that, we just</span> <span data-start="113260">want to start by recognizing that frameworks</span> <span data-start="115270">are part of the web.</span> <span data-start="116350">And if you're using a framework, you</span> <span data-start="118540">are in fact using the platform.</span> <span data-start="121430">So let's go from there and kind of extrapolate</span> <span data-start="124150">to the further web stack that is based on that insight.</span> <span data-start="129130">So on the bottom, obviously, you have the web primitives.</span> <span data-start="131750">So that would be the Dom, the Fetch API, service workers,</span> <span data-start="135190">stuff like that.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="137432"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: Then above that, we have built-in modules.</span> <span data-start="139890">Built-in modules are pretty exciting.</span> <span data-start="141557">They're a new thing.</span> <span data-start="142390">It's the idea that we can build in a layered way for the web.</span> <span data-start="146860">They're high-level APIs that solve something</span> <span data-start="149940">like virtual scrolling or carousels.</span> <span data-start="152070">I think we all love to hate the carousel.</span> <span data-start="153804">But if we're truly honest, they're</span> <span data-start="155220">on almost every site in the known universe.</span> <span data-start="158140">So we can build something like a high-level API,</span> <span data-start="160140">like a virtual scroller, and then that</span> <span data-start="162480">drives out the low-level APIs that we</span> <span data-start="164640">need to make those experiences accessible, searchable, truly</span> <span data-start="168120">fast.</span> <span data-start="169410">Those low-level APIs can then be used by the entire ecosystem</span> <span data-start="172860">of virtual scrollers.</span> <span data-start="174360">That makes a big difference because it allows everyone</span> <span data-start="176610">to level up together.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="178072"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="178780">Then one level up, we've got the frameworks.</span> <span data-start="180630">So that would be like React, Angular, Polymer,</span> <span data-start="183660">or higher-level stuff, like Next.js and Sapper that kind of</span> <span data-start="187830">treat you to everything that you need to build an application.</span> <span data-start="190500">So obviously, these aren't standardized.</span> <span data-start="192500">They're not web standards, but most applications</span> <span data-start="194790">use one of these.</span> <span data-start="195640">And so we think of them as part of the platform.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="198969"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: The next part is web components.</span> <span data-start="201010">And you're probably thinking, wait,</span> <span data-start="202030">that doesn't make any sense.</span> <span data-start="203196">Web components are a web primitive or a web standard.</span> <span data-start="205900">I'm not talking about the web components, the standards,</span> <span data-start="208450">I'm talking about your web components —  your date picker</span> <span data-start="210910">or, I don't know, tabs.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="212450"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Maybe the carousel.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="213700"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: Maybe your carousel.</span> <span data-start="215241">Sorry.</span> <span data-start="216290">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="216790">These are the web components that</span> <span data-start="218680">layer on top of your stack.</span> <span data-start="220420">Why it's important to put them there</span> <span data-start="221920">is because they're an important measure of interoperability</span> <span data-start="224378">between different parts of your system.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="226672"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="227380">To kind of make a point, let's do a quick poll here.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="229420"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: Ooh, yeah.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="230544"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Who here in this room has built a React application?</span> <span data-start="233241">All right.</span> <span data-start="233740">That's most hands.</span> <span data-start="234920">So if you — </span> </section>

<section><span data-start="235430"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: Oh, keep them up.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="236090"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: No, no.</span> <span data-start="236270">Keep it up.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="236540"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: Keep them up.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="236620"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Keep it up.</span> <span data-start="237536">Keep it up.</span> <span data-start="238100">If anywhere in your company you also have an Angular,</span> <span data-start="241430">jQuery, Backbone, Polymer, anything like it, both hands.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="246974"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: Yeah.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="247890"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: All right.</span> <span data-start="248636">So if that's the case — </span> </section>

<section><span data-start="249670"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: I love your honesty.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="251297"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Wouldn't it be nice if you could use the date</span> <span data-start="253630">picker in both of those?</span> <span data-start="254837">If you could have a design system that</span> <span data-start="256420">spans your entire applications suite,</span> <span data-start="258610">no other framework gets built in.</span> <span data-start="260050">So that's where we think the leaf components, web</span> <span data-start="262630">components, are really the right technology to build that.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="265909"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: There's, however, a real problem</span> <span data-start="267950">with web development today.</span> <span data-start="269540">We're struggling to make stuff that's</span> <span data-start="271190">really fast and responsive and has buttery-smooth animations.</span> <span data-start="273765">And I think we're struggling because, in a bunch of ways,</span> <span data-start="276140">it's actually really hard.</span> <span data-start="277890">Not everybody struggles.</span> <span data-start="279140">There are examples of sites that achieve this.</span> <span data-start="281420">But at scale, what we observe is that our performance goals</span> <span data-start="284750">aren't being met.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="286352"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="287060">And so what we're observing is that, in web dev today,</span> <span data-start="290665">we often have to make that choice between developer</span> <span data-start="292790">experience — </span> <span data-start="293930">how we feel as developers —  and user</span> <span data-start="295640">experience —  how users feel.</span> <span data-start="297410">And that shouldn't really be how things are.</span> <span data-start="299970">In the vast majority of cases, developer experience</span> <span data-start="303080">combined to accumulate a great user experience —  that's</span> <span data-start="306110">just not how it works today.</span> <span data-start="307680">But if we can achieve those things coming together,</span> <span data-start="310310">the web will be better for everyone.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="312624"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: This is why we're</span> <span data-start="314040">so excited about frameworks.</span> <span data-start="315780">Yes, frameworks sometimes make web apps slower.</span> <span data-start="318210">That's a reality.</span> <span data-start="319830">But they're also our best hope to make them faster.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="322590"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="323730">That's a bold statement.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="324730"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: It is a bold statement.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="325560"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Right?</span> <span data-start="326330">To prove that this is actually happening,</span> <span data-start="328480">we thought, wouldn't it be nice if we celebrated</span> <span data-start="330810">all the great improvements that framework</span> <span data-start="333360">has made through this year?</span> <span data-start="335170">Let's start with React.</span> <span data-start="336690">They have done a bunch of foundational work.</span> <span data-start="338670">For example, they're working towards making code splitting</span> <span data-start="341370">something that's first class supported</span> <span data-start="343410">in the framework, which is really nice.</span> <span data-start="345250">And then they've done a lot of work</span> <span data-start="346708">to break up the rendering of huge dump trees</span> <span data-start="349020">into tiny chunks.</span> <span data-start="349890">So that if you have a big update,</span> <span data-start="351720">it doesn't lock down your browser for many seconds.</span> <span data-start="354030">Everything's kind of done in small bricks.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="356035"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: This is a theme you're</span> <span data-start="357660">going to hear us talking about a few times.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="359451"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Yeah.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="360191"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: Angular made improvements, too.</span> <span data-start="362190">The Angular CLI enabled performance budgets.</span> <span data-start="364637">This is great.</span> <span data-start="365220">Because how often do you not realize that you actually</span> <span data-start="368220">alienated a bunch of users by adding that one more library,</span> <span data-start="371130">or NPM installing something, then it</span> <span data-start="372800">installed a whole bunch of other things?</span> <span data-start="375300">Angular also did a bunch of work to remove unnecessary polyfils,</span> <span data-start="378950">and that's fantastic.</span> <span data-start="379890">We don't want polyfils for the most modern browsers.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="382057"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="382765">Speaking of which, Vue basically did the same thing</span> <span data-start="385110">with a thing called modern mode.</span> <span data-start="386700">So you only ship the modern code to modern browsers, right?</span> <span data-start="389158">And that's effectively the same idea.</span> <span data-start="391300">And that's why we're so excited about frameworks</span> <span data-start="393300">bringing this best practice to all the users.</span> <span data-start="396210">Similarly, with another one, just making — </span> <span data-start="397986">preloading, prefetching something</span> <span data-start="399360">the framework does by default.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="401552"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: Polymer did some good work this year, too.</span> <span data-start="404010">They're transitioning to lit-element</span> <span data-start="405540">for super small components.</span> <span data-start="407790">And they also got faster because, yay, Firefox shipped</span> <span data-start="410162">native web component support.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="411370"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Woo!</span> <span data-start="412700">Cool.</span> <span data-start="413200">Let's talk about Svelte.</span> <span data-start="414240">They get a bullet point for already being super fast.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="416460"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: Yeah, it's kind of hard — </span> <span data-start="418210">with Svelte, it was like, well, they're so fast,</span> <span data-start="420270">what do we even say about this?</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="421480"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="421800">But I think this was a great example.</span> <span data-start="423270">So they built a Hacker News app, and they did it</span> <span data-start="425270">in an idiomatic way, so not using — </span> </section>

<section><span data-start="427037"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: It wasn't super highly optimized.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="429120"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>:  — super ridiculous hacks, right?</span> <span data-start="429900">So everything in that app — </span> <span data-start="431550">HTML, CSS, JavaScript —  together is under 20 kilobytes,</span> <span data-start="434880">which is just amazing.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="437000"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: AMP did some good — </span> <span data-start="438500">Malte did some good stuff, too.</span> <span data-start="440540">So this, apparently, is the only feature</span> <span data-start="442234">he shipped this year, because now he's a manager.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="444275"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Yeah, I'm sorry.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="445730"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: So he ships feature policies</span> <span data-start="447980">against synchronous XHR for all ads.</span> <span data-start="449601">If you're going to ship one feature,</span> <span data-start="451100">this is a pretty darn good one.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="452210"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="452360">If you're [INAUDIBLE],, you get to put your own feature</span> <span data-start="454651">on the slide.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="455585"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: Nice.</span> <span data-start="456932">He also reduced —  or sorry, they also reduced — </span> </section>

<section><span data-start="458890"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: No, definitely not me.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="460414"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>:  — reduced the JS size on the wire by 20%,</span> <span data-start="462830">by enabling Brotli compression algorithm.</span> <span data-start="465374">We love this kind of thing, right?</span> <span data-start="466790">Because how great is it that all you have to do</span> <span data-start="468989">is turn on a different kind of compression,</span> <span data-start="470780">and you get 20% reduction in size on the wire?</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="473930"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="475130">Moving on to Ember, which removed jQuery from the default</span> <span data-start="478647">bundle, by the way — </span> <span data-start="479480">I have a jQuery t-shirt.</span> <span data-start="481492">Just leaving that out there —  making their bundle size 20%</span> <span data-start="484610">smaller, which is great.</span> <span data-start="485990">And they did it in a way that's backward compatible</span> <span data-start="488114">so that people can slowly migrate to this.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="489980"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: Yeah, it's pretty neat.</span> <span data-start="490830">They actually, as far as I understand, made it</span> <span data-start="492830">so that anyone can turn on and off old code — </span> </section>

<section><span data-start="495212"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Right.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="495920"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>:  — using the same functionality.</span> <span data-start="496925">So that's pretty great.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="498170"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: And then another theme here,</span> <span data-start="500150">implementing the incremental progressive rendering</span> <span data-start="502280">with batched rehydration, which again, comes down</span> <span data-start="505760">to that "chunking of work" theme, which we're seeing here</span> <span data-start="509150">all the time.</span> <span data-start="511340">Great.</span> <span data-start="511840">So to summarize this, we really want to get to a state</span> <span data-start="514789">where not only the super experts can make great web experiences,</span> <span data-start="518270">everyone should be able to do it.</span> <span data-start="519844">And frameworks are an integral part of making that happen.</span> <span data-start="522260">Today, we feel that we — </span> <span data-start="524120">and by we, I mean browsers, framework and tools — </span> <span data-start="526760">have under-invested in tools that</span> <span data-start="528554">focus on combining great developer</span> <span data-start="529970">experience with a focus on user experience.</span> <span data-start="531900">Well, we can make this happen as a community.</span> <span data-start="533820">By integrating the best practices for performance</span> <span data-start="536120">into frameworks, all users of those frameworks</span> <span data-start="538760">automatically get all the benefits.</span> <span data-start="540580">And that's how we think we can achieve</span> <span data-start="542163">great outcomes for users at the scale of the web.</span> <span data-start="546240">All right.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="547179"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: To make this happen,</span> <span data-start="548720">we're announcing three things today.</span> <span data-start="551730">The first one is, we are including</span> <span data-start="553850">frameworks in the Chrome Intent to Implement process.</span> <span data-start="557317">How many folks know about our intent to implement,</span> <span data-start="559400">intent to ship stuff?</span> <span data-start="561170">A few.</span> <span data-start="561710">Great.</span> <span data-start="561980">That's awesome.</span> <span data-start="562730">So we have, basically, two important check points — </span> <span data-start="565070">we have more than that, but two very</span> <span data-start="566600">important check points —  when we're</span> <span data-start="567800">going to ship a new feature.</span> <span data-start="569180">One is our intent to implement and the other</span> <span data-start="571400">is our intent to ship.</span> <span data-start="573230">At both points, when we are about to build something</span> <span data-start="575686">and when we're about to ship something,</span> <span data-start="577310">we want to get a lot of feedback.</span> <span data-start="578790">And so we go through this intent process</span> <span data-start="581270">in order to intentionally go in and draw in that feedback.</span> <span data-start="584450">Previously, we had listed web developers as folks</span> <span data-start="588410">that we wanted to get feedback from.</span> <span data-start="590240">But now, we're actually explicitly adding</span> <span data-start="592070">frameworks to that intent to implement process.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="595860"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="596730">And secondly, we want to put real dollars behind this.</span> <span data-start="599670">So we're starting with a budget of $200,000</span> <span data-start="601760">to kickstart developing of performance-related features</span> <span data-start="604370">in frameworks.</span> <span data-start="605720">In particular, we make available a list of performance</span> <span data-start="607970">features that we'd love all frameworks to provide</span> <span data-start="610640">to the users by default. Folks who are working on a framework</span> <span data-start="614130">can ask for funding to do the actual work.</span> <span data-start="616570">We're still working out the exact details.</span> <span data-start="618500">But if you're interested, check out this bit.ly link</span> <span data-start="621290">for more information.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="624775"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: The third thing that we want to do</span> <span data-start="626900">is increase collaboration between frameworks</span> <span data-start="629890">and the Chrome team.</span> <span data-start="631500">It's funny to announce this today,</span> <span data-start="633020">because it's actually something that we started in the summer.</span> <span data-start="635190">And we've been working with a bunch of frameworks</span> <span data-start="637340">for the past several months, but we</span> <span data-start="640430">are excited today to talk through some</span> <span data-start="642470">of what we've started already.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="644792"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="645500">That brings us to our next section.</span> <span data-start="647940">It's very much under construction.</span> <span data-start="649830">You heard that in the intro today.</span> <span data-start="651700">What you're hearing about here —  these</span> <span data-start="653330">aren't things that are shipping tomorrow.</span> <span data-start="654740">Some of them you can try out a little bit.</span> <span data-start="656720">Some of them are really just — </span> </section>

<section><span data-start="658170"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: Some behind a flag.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="658790"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Yeah.</span> <span data-start="659120">We're really just thinking about them.</span> <span data-start="661020">So it's still very much time to give us your feedback, your use</span> <span data-start="664160">cases, your examples, to work out how they really work.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="667784"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: The first one we want to talk about</span> <span data-start="669950">is Display Locking.</span> <span data-start="671600">We basically don't want to update the DOM inadvertently,</span> <span data-start="674040">and so this gives us a way to lock it.</span> <span data-start="676160">Before I joined Google, there —  well, many times,</span> <span data-start="679370">I think this is one of the most requested features.</span> <span data-start="682060">But before I joined Google, the Polymer team and the Paint team</span> <span data-start="686510">had a bunch of conversations about a new primitive</span> <span data-start="688970">called Display Locking.</span> <span data-start="690512">The idea of Display Locking is that you can basically</span> <span data-start="692720">lock down a section of your DOM, and we</span> <span data-start="695090">won't trigger render and other things on that bit of DOM</span> <span data-start="697790">until you unlock it and say, OK, it's ready to go.</span> <span data-start="701030">It's super subtle.</span> <span data-start="701799">And it may not be something you interact with directly,</span> <span data-start="704090">but it's definitely something that frameworks need in order</span> <span data-start="706548">to eliminate unnecessary browser work.</span> <span data-start="709097">Now, we're collaborating with the React team</span> <span data-start="710930">to nail down the API.</span> <span data-start="712220">And we had an Intent to Implement out</span> <span data-start="714080">about a month ago.</span> <span data-start="715020">So if you have comments, we'd love to hear them.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="717120"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: I have a question, though.</span> <span data-start="717740">Is it related to that bocolor?</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="719140"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: [LAUGHS]</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="720415"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Because I'm using every day.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="722060"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: Yeah, absolutely.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="723730"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Nice.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="724467"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: [LAUGHS] Well, this is kind of awkward.</span> <span data-start="730720">Is it working?</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="731970"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: I don't know.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="733040"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: It's kind of strange to see</span> <span data-start="734873">a blank white screen in the middle of a presentation.</span> <span data-start="737660">Why do we think that's OK when web pages are loading?</span> <span data-start="740290">It's sort of —  ah, what's going on?</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="742232"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="742940">Every time —  every single time you load a new web page,</span> <span data-start="745700">the browser says, hm, what's the good idea to do?</span> <span data-start="748190">Oh, yeah, I'm going to paint white.</span> <span data-start="750490">And then it's going to take a while, right?</span> <span data-start="752695">Why is that the case?</span> <span data-start="753570">So it shouldn't be the case.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="754730"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: We should tell you</span> <span data-start="755330">that we totally scared the tech check people</span> <span data-start="757550">when we had a blank white screen during our tech check.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="760485"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: All right.</span> <span data-start="761360">We really need page transitions on the web.</span> <span data-start="764162">You're probably familiar with stuff</span> <span data-start="765620">like this from the material design specification</span> <span data-start="768442">where one page morphs to the other.</span> <span data-start="769900">And there's other ideas how to do this.</span> <span data-start="771737">Now, this is something you would see in your application going</span> <span data-start="774320">from one state to another, but we also</span> <span data-start="777650">want this for normal navigations, right?</span> <span data-start="780020">Here's a great example.</span> <span data-start="781080">So this is something the image search team at Google</span> <span data-start="783950">is working on.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="784534"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: It's kind of subtle, so look closely.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="786783"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Yeah, well, we'll walk you through it.</span> <span data-start="788830">So this is their image search result page.</span> <span data-start="790580">And when you click one of the images,</span> <span data-start="792890">you go into this box to see the larger version of the image.</span> <span data-start="796800">So their goal was that more people click through</span> <span data-start="799010">to the underlying web page.</span> <span data-start="800730">And so they wanted to make that really</span> <span data-start="803360">easy by just literally putting that web</span> <span data-start="805790">page at the bottom of the page, right?</span> <span data-start="809120">So that, as a user, all you have to do is put your finger on it</span> <span data-start="813500">and draw it up.</span> <span data-start="817490">We're hoping that this greatly increases</span> <span data-start="820630">the number of navigations actually happening.</span> <span data-start="823220">But this is something that you really just</span> <span data-start="825110">can't build on the web today.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="826319"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: And we'd love for you</span> <span data-start="827901">to be thinking, if you didn't have</span> <span data-start="829340">to have that blank white screen, what would you build?</span> <span data-start="831650">What would you design?</span> <span data-start="832580">Because I think it's actually a pretty exciting space.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="835070"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="835310">Today, you really have to choose between</span> <span data-start="836976">either a fancy transition or doing a real navigation</span> <span data-start="840200">where the browser loads on your page.</span> <span data-start="841850">And there isn't really a solution</span> <span data-start="843290">for the cross-origin case where you navigate</span> <span data-start="845540">to different domain at all.</span> <span data-start="848050">And so that's why we're so excited about portals.</span> <span data-start="850250">What portals give you are advanced transitions</span> <span data-start="853070">between websites that are real navigations.</span> <span data-start="855860">SPAs, single-page apps, that's the way to do it today.</span> <span data-start="860030">But here, you can —  and this is what this example GIF shows — </span> <span data-start="864560">this is a navigation from one web page to another.</span> <span data-start="867780">And you can morph between them any way you like,</span> <span data-start="870740">which seems like something we should have in 2018.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="873429"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: It does, doesn't it?</span> <span data-start="874970">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="875479">I think sometimes people choose a single-page app</span> <span data-start="877520">with all of its complexity, when actually what they</span> <span data-start="879350">wanted was fancy transitions.</span> <span data-start="880450">So we hope that this [INAUDIBLE]</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="880830"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="881538">It can be really hard to do a single-page app.</span> <span data-start="883920">Cool.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="886290"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: So I got a sporty new car.</span> <span data-start="888090">And within a month, I got a ticket.</span> <span data-start="891000">I was driving too fast.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="892710"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: [INAUDIBLE],, hopefully.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="894450"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: No.</span> <span data-start="895640">On the San Mateo bridge.</span> <span data-start="897000">Whoops.</span> <span data-start="898590">I won't tell you how fast I was going,</span> <span data-start="900870">but I found out that my car has this really cool feature.</span> <span data-start="904560">I can turn something on so that it beeps anytime</span> <span data-start="906630">I go over 80 miles per hour.</span> <span data-start="909090">That seems really good, because there should be limits.</span> <span data-start="912355">And this car does not feel like it's going fast when it's</span> <span data-start="914730">going actually pretty fast.</span> <span data-start="917617">There's also something you can turn on</span> <span data-start="919200">for a motor or a car, which is called a governor, which</span> <span data-start="921630">actually will not allow the car to go over a certain speed.</span> <span data-start="926250">Feature policies are sort of like that.</span> <span data-start="928470">You have a couple of options.</span> <span data-start="930130">You have Enforce mode and you have Report-Only mode.</span> <span data-start="932820">You can turn a feature policy on for something</span> <span data-start="935040">like synchronous XHR, and you can say, no,</span> <span data-start="937816">I don't want to allow that.</span> <span data-start="938940">And it simply will not allow that to happen</span> <span data-start="941520">on your site at all anymore.</span> <span data-start="943710">Or you can turn on Report-Only mode, and you get that beep.</span> <span data-start="946750">Hey, something's wrong.</span> <span data-start="947860">You should check it out.</span> <span data-start="949449">We're pretty excited about feature policies</span> <span data-start="951240">because they run in CI.</span> <span data-start="952307">You can run them in development.</span> <span data-start="953640">You can run a different set of feature policies</span> <span data-start="955770">on your third-party content, your ad content,</span> <span data-start="957690">than you do on your regular page.</span> <span data-start="959544">So you've got a lot of flexibility</span> <span data-start="960960">around how you use it, and we're excited to see</span> <span data-start="962918">what you want to do with it.</span> <span data-start="964410">What you can use today is a synchronous XHR feature policy.</span> <span data-start="967944">We collaborated with the AMP team,</span> <span data-start="969360">and they've got it turned on for all ads in AMP, which</span> <span data-start="972330">is pretty exciting.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="973122"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: This is, basically, by the way, the worst</span> <span data-start="975288">feature of the web.</span> <span data-start="976410">You want to turn this off for your website, right?</span> <span data-start="977970">There's no good reason to have Sync XHR.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="979710"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: There's basically</span> <span data-start="980220">no conversation in which Malte does not</span> <span data-start="981990">bring up that you should turn off Synchronous XHR.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="983920"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: I'm so mad about it.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="985211"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: [LAUGHS] Even at your barbecues.</span> <span data-start="989040">There are other policies that are available, as well.</span> <span data-start="991300">So there are some exciting ones, but they're behind a flag.</span> <span data-start="994315">So you have to go and turn it on behind the flag in order</span> <span data-start="996690">to check it out.</span> <span data-start="997290">There are three I'd love for you to look</span> <span data-start="998956">at —  unoptimized images, oversized images,</span> <span data-start="1001310">and unsized media.</span> <span data-start="1003050">Go see how they improve your performance.</span> <span data-start="1005290">See whether you like it with Enforce mode on,</span> <span data-start="1007370">or Report-Only mode.</span> <span data-start="1009024">We would love more feedback.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1017660"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="1019560">All right.</span> <span data-start="1020060">Next, we want to talk about instant loading,</span> <span data-start="1021893">so how we get from super fast to 0 milliseconds.</span> <span data-start="1025790">To show you what exactly we mean by that —  because instant</span> <span data-start="1029260">is an overloaded word, right?</span> <span data-start="1030589">There's instant apps, which don't do instant stuff.</span> <span data-start="1034200">So let's talk about this.</span> <span data-start="1036660">Here's a film strip you might be familiar with from how</span> <span data-start="1039069">a web page loads.</span> <span data-start="1039859">This one loads in eight seconds, right?</span> <span data-start="1041089">And obviously, you could make that faster.</span> <span data-start="1043099">But — </span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1043250"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: I mean, we've spent years trying</span> <span data-start="1045291">to eek out every little second that we can out of the film</span> <span data-start="1048410">strip, right?</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1110210"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: From people who are working on it, which is great.</span> <span data-start="1112751">So the way web packaging works is</span> <span data-start="1114320">that you're a document author, and you have a TLS certificate</span> <span data-start="1117920">that we're using for HTTPS, something like that.</span> <span data-start="1120560">And you sign that content to be created by you.</span> <span data-start="1124400">And then anyone can deliver it on your behalf,</span> <span data-start="1126630">but the browser says, OK, this was originally</span> <span data-start="1128930">signed with that TLS key, so I can</span> <span data-start="1130520">say it came from example.com, because that</span> <span data-start="1132770">was the original party.</span> <span data-start="1134330">And I want to drill down on this.</span> <span data-start="1136280">Anyone can deliver it.</span> <span data-start="1137300">So you could have a different CDN,</span> <span data-start="1140030">but you can deliver it over BitTorrent or IPFS.</span> <span data-start="1142250">It doesn't really matter.</span> <span data-start="1143670">You can do basically HTTP over anything, which is really cool.</span> <span data-start="1149659">Oh, my god, look at this.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1150700"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: So we collaborated with the AMP team</span> <span data-start="1152860">on this, because they're one of the frameworks</span> <span data-start="1154330">that we're working with.</span> <span data-start="1155630">And we're pretty excited about the instant loading</span> <span data-start="1158950">and how fast we're going to be able to bring content to users.</span> <span data-start="1161950">But Malte, what about the URLs?</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1163242"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Yeah, AMP doesn't have very good URLs.</span> <span data-start="1165283">So there's [INAUDIBLE] AMP.</span> <span data-start="1166990">And with web packaging, that problem</span> <span data-start="1168580">goes away, which is really cool.</span> <span data-start="1170339">So that's why we're excited about it.</span> <span data-start="1171880">But —  and this is the important part — </span> <span data-start="1173620">it's a web standard, right?</span> <span data-start="1174880">And so with web packaging, we can bring Instant Loading</span> <span data-start="1177850">to all these frameworks.</span> <span data-start="1178960">And this is not an exhaustive list, right?</span> <span data-start="1180710">It doesn't really matter.</span> <span data-start="1181780">This technology is completely technology — </span> <span data-start="1185051">it doesn't care about technology.</span> <span data-start="1186550">So really, really cool.</span> <span data-start="1187940">We can't wait for this to land on browsers.</span> <span data-start="1192620">Web packaging also addresses one more problem</span> <span data-start="1195070">that I think is really subtle.</span> <span data-start="1197470">Eric Meyer tweeted this and wrote this blog post, which</span> <span data-start="1199990">is really cool, a while ago.</span> <span data-start="1202900">Traveling to Africa and noticing that HTTPS,</span> <span data-start="1207370">which is the greatest thing that happened to the web in a while,</span> <span data-start="1210160">among many other greatest things — </span> <span data-start="1212080">actually introduced a few problems.</span> <span data-start="1213940">So let's imagine you're a cell tower.</span> <span data-start="1218050">And you're not actually connected well to the internet,</span> <span data-start="1221140">but you have LTE to everyone connected to you.</span> <span data-start="1223700">Right?</span> <span data-start="1224200">It's great if you have an edge cache at that cell tower.</span> <span data-start="1226922">Now, with HTTP, that's something you can build.</span> <span data-start="1228880">With HTTPS, it's something you can't build.</span> <span data-start="1231530">So you always have to go to the origin, to someone actually</span> <span data-start="1234160">able to serve on that TLS certificate.</span> <span data-start="1236275">Right?</span> <span data-start="1238090">And the great thing about web packaging</span> <span data-start="1240100">is that it can bring back that feature.</span> <span data-start="1242770">Because it's untangling delivery from TLS security,</span> <span data-start="1247090">you can get all great benefit of having edge caching for HTTP,</span> <span data-start="1252430">but have it together with the security benefits of TLS.</span> <span data-start="1257690">I also want to just really quickly say</span> <span data-start="1259670">that web packaging is not related to Webpack.</span> <span data-start="1262430">However — </span> <span data-start="1263120">[LAUGHTER]</span> <span data-start="1265010"> — however, there's a bundling spec coming up.</span> <span data-start="1268580">And so web packaging is actually going</span> <span data-start="1271160">to bring bundling as a first-class feature to the web</span> <span data-start="1274370">platform, which I think is also way overdue.</span> <span data-start="1277140">And so bundlers, like Webpack, can eventually</span> <span data-start="1279650">use Web Packaging as the output format.</span> <span data-start="1283250">You can actually try this today.</span> <span data-start="1284880">There's a subspec, called Signed Exchange,</span> <span data-start="1286910">which is available in Origin Trial.</span> <span data-start="1288920">You can go to this URL and try it out.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1292797"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: Let us know what you think.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1294630"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Yeah.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1296752"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: Later today, you'll hear [INAUDIBLE] and — </span> <span data-start="1299210">who else is speaking about it?</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1299970"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: [INAUDIBLE]</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1300886"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: Yes.</span> <span data-start="1303180">So the next bit that we'd like to talk to you about</span> <span data-start="1305670">is scheduling.</span> <span data-start="1306630">So any time developers build something sufficiently complex,</span> <span data-start="1309729">they end up needing to manage a task queue,</span> <span data-start="1311520">prioritize work, and be sure that everything</span> <span data-start="1313353">is getting done on time.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1314361"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: So we don't run out of time on our talk.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1316485"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: That, too.</span> <span data-start="1317910">A typical app has competing deadlines,</span> <span data-start="1319650">so keeping the user input responsive,</span> <span data-start="1322560">while rendering smoothly at 60 frames per second,</span> <span data-start="1325950">and doing the actual work of fetching, preparing,</span> <span data-start="1328500">and rendering the UI.</span> <span data-start="1331620">In talking to the React team a few months ago,</span> <span data-start="1334090">we realized that a framework-based scheduler</span> <span data-start="1336270">has serious downsides.</span> <span data-start="1338400">It can't schedule third-party code.</span> <span data-start="1340980">It has a lot of difficulty interleaving</span> <span data-start="1343230">tasks with browser functions, like rendering and garbage</span> <span data-start="1345690">collection.</span> <span data-start="1346950">In short, it has to fight other systems for resources.</span> <span data-start="1352180">With help from React, Google Maps, AMP, Polymer, and Ember,</span> <span data-start="1355646">as well as the web standards community,</span> <span data-start="1357270">[? Shuby ?] and Jason —  who you're going to hear from later</span> <span data-start="1359080">today — </span> <span data-start="1360100">are designing a scheduler that will run in the browser.</span> <span data-start="1362980">It's meant to have high and low-level APIs, like Grand</span> <span data-start="1365530">Central Dispatch, so borrowing some ideas there,</span> <span data-start="1369160">and be able to interleave code from all different sources.</span> <span data-start="1372030">They're working on things like, how do you</span> <span data-start="1373780">interleave garbage collection or code that's in a promise?</span> <span data-start="1378490">What's exciting about this, in particular,</span> <span data-start="1380240">is that when you break things down into small tasks,</span> <span data-start="1384096">it's much more useful if you have a great way</span> <span data-start="1385970">to schedule them.</span> <span data-start="1386900">When you can schedule things, they're</span> <span data-start="1388441">much more valuable if you've broken things down</span> <span data-start="1390590">into small tasks.</span> <span data-start="1391940">This is where frameworks and the browser</span> <span data-start="1394700">can work well together to provide a much better user</span> <span data-start="1397610">experience than we're capable of providing today.</span> <span data-start="1400920">This is one of the things I'm most excited to PM right now,</span> <span data-start="1403490">and I'm really excited for you to hear</span> <span data-start="1405080">from [? Shuby ?] and Jason later.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1406570"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="1406880">It's really a good example for how frameworks help.</span> <span data-start="1409005">Because actually taking your code</span> <span data-start="1411315">and breaking it down into small chunks,</span> <span data-start="1412940">that's really, really difficult. But as a framework layer,</span> <span data-start="1416930">this is something that people can just</span> <span data-start="1419660">take a long time doing, but then having it for everyone.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1422030"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: I mean, I think you saw,</span> <span data-start="1423738">in the framework awards section earlier,</span> <span data-start="1425450">that three frameworks, at least, are</span> <span data-start="1427280">working on breaking things down into really tiny rendering</span> <span data-start="1429710">chunks.</span> <span data-start="1430209">So this is pretty exciting.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1431510"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="1432230">Next, we're talking about Animation Worklet and Jank-Free</span> <span data-start="1434940">Parallax.</span> <span data-start="1435440">By the way, ironically, in front of a janky animated GIF.</span> <span data-start="1439520">So Animation Worklet —  first, we need</span> <span data-start="1442280">to talk about other animation APIs because there are a few.</span> <span data-start="1445160">There's the Web Animation API, which is great.</span> <span data-start="1447214">And you should use it.</span> <span data-start="1448130">And also more importantly, it just landed in Safari Preview.</span> <span data-start="1451430">So relatively soon, we should have it in most browsers.</span> <span data-start="1454680">CSS animations are also awesome, and they're basically</span> <span data-start="1457720">everywhere.</span> <span data-start="1458220">So you can use them.</span> <span data-start="1459410">And you should use these APIs.</span> <span data-start="1460900">And Animation Worklet doesn't provide additional value,</span> <span data-start="1463820">except in some very important circumstances.</span> <span data-start="1466970">Because these APIs are inherently time-based,</span> <span data-start="1470180">which makes sense, animations go from A to B over time.</span> <span data-start="1473390">That's kind of what they do.</span> <span data-start="1475260">However, there are some animations</span> <span data-start="1476900">that aren't time-based.</span> <span data-start="1478550">For example, this one, which animates Pac-Man</span> <span data-start="1481220">based on scrolling left and right.</span> <span data-start="1483350">And this is something that's really difficult</span> <span data-start="1485390">to do on the web today in a jank-free fashion.</span> <span data-start="1490710">So the reason for this is that, with Animation Worklet,</span> <span data-start="1493050">on the other hand, where you don't get jank</span> <span data-start="1494841">is because that actual worklet runs super close</span> <span data-start="1497550">to the actual software that does the scrolling.</span> <span data-start="1500160">And so you can do it, even when the main thread does anything</span> <span data-start="1503940">busy, which is really cool.</span> <span data-start="1506130">My team actually has been working</span> <span data-start="1508020">on getting this into our —  what we call —  scrollbot animations.</span> <span data-start="1511500">And it was just a drop-in replacement.</span> <span data-start="1513640">And it makes everything so much smoother.</span> <span data-start="1516445">[? Surma ?] is talking about this later today</span> <span data-start="1518320">in the talk about Houdini.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1521810"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Yeah.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1523870"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: Almost every web app eventually</span> <span data-start="1525870">needs something like an infinite list.</span> <span data-start="1528570">It just happens, right?</span> <span data-start="1531150">On other systems —  on Android, on iOS — </span> <span data-start="1533550">there are things like UI table view.</span> <span data-start="1535560">On the web, you're left to figure it out yourself.</span> <span data-start="1539460">Now, many frameworks have really good implementations</span> <span data-start="1542670">of a virtual list in an infinite scroller kind of situation.</span> <span data-start="1546630">But the web platform primitives make certain behaviors</span> <span data-start="1549150">impossible.</span> <span data-start="1550410">For example, have you tried to use findInPage if you're</span> <span data-start="1552750">using an infinite list?</span> <span data-start="1553950">I often find myself going back to search for a tweet</span> <span data-start="1556440">that I made, or someone else made some time ago.</span> <span data-start="1558580">You can't search for things that aren't actually</span> <span data-start="1560580">in the DOM right then.</span> <span data-start="1561960">This is obviously going to have accessibility implications,</span> <span data-start="1565620">as well.</span> <span data-start="1566970">With new low-level APIs that we're putting into place,</span> <span data-start="1569610">like searchable and visible DOM, all</span> <span data-start="1571565">of the sudden, these things become solvable and get</span> <span data-start="1573690">addressed.</span> <span data-start="1574890">You'll hear more about our collaborations</span> <span data-start="1576780">with React, Virtualized, Angular, and Twitter</span> <span data-start="1580110">in Gray's talk a little later today.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1582905"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: All right.</span> <span data-start="1583780">So that brings us to the end of our talk.</span> <span data-start="1585790">Just summarizing —  we have been talking</span> <span data-start="1588790">about our vision for a framework-inclusive web</span> <span data-start="1591250">platform future.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1593542"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: Instant loading and page transitions</span> <span data-start="1595750">are coming to the web.</span> <span data-start="1596840">Especially if you're a designer, get</span> <span data-start="1598130">thinking about what you're going to build with that</span> <span data-start="1600160">because it's going to be kind of cool.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1601610"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="1602318">And then we talked about a set of new low-level APIs</span> <span data-start="1604840">making it easier to build reliably fast web apps.</span> <span data-start="1607510">And that's especially true if frameworks</span> <span data-start="1609430">help web developers take advantage of them by default.</span> <span data-start="1612755">Thank you, very much.</span> </section>
