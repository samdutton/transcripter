<section><span data-start="6244"><span class="speaker">Alberto Medina</span>: I'm Alberto.</span> <span data-start="7410">I'm a developer advocate in the Content Ecosystem</span> <span data-start="9870">Team at Google.</span> <span data-start="10950">And I'm super happy to be here with my teammate, Weston Ruter.</span> <span data-start="14160">We are going to talk about bringing</span> <span data-start="15960">the pillars of modern web development</span> <span data-start="17610">to the space of content management systems.</span> <span data-start="19660">But let's start with the end goal in mind.</span> <span data-start="22830">Our goal as web creators is to maximize the joy</span> <span data-start="26580">that our users get when they go to the websites we build</span> <span data-start="29910">or the content that we create and publish on the web.</span> <span data-start="32880">And although it is true that user experience is</span> <span data-start="35820">a complex matter, there are certain elements</span> <span data-start="38400">that are commonly found in experiences that users love.</span> <span data-start="42210">Specifically, users love presentations</span> <span data-start="45780">that work, number one.</span> <span data-start="47880">They love sites that load fast consistently</span> <span data-start="51330">and offer good runtime performance.</span> <span data-start="54090">They love sites where they feel safe when they trust their data</span> <span data-start="58890">or they do transactions when they decide to do so.</span> <span data-start="61950">They like sites that feel accessible,</span> <span data-start="64967">and they are integrated with the full capabilities</span> <span data-start="67050">of their devices.</span> <span data-start="68160">And they love sites that offer great content quality.</span> <span data-start="72120">The good news is that we can build today experiences that</span> <span data-start="76500">have these pillars if we take advantage of the capabilities</span> <span data-start="79920">that the modern web has to offer.</span> <span data-start="82210">Now, doing this is what we call progressive web development.</span> <span data-start="86520">In essence, progressive web development</span> <span data-start="88680">is developing user-first experiences</span> <span data-start="93810">using modern workflows and modern web APIs,</span> <span data-start="96600">following coding best practices and performance best practices,</span> <span data-start="99420">and taking advantage of effective incentive mechanisms</span> <span data-start="102540">and validation structures that are available to all, to us.</span> <span data-start="106320">Now, we can take advantage of these principles</span> <span data-start="109050">in different ways, depending about how</span> <span data-start="111090">we go through the creative process,</span> <span data-start="113220">how do we create things in the web.</span> <span data-start="114780">In general, the things that we create in the web</span> <span data-start="117180">follow in two categories.</span> <span data-start="118740">On one hand, we can build websites or web apps</span> <span data-start="121680">from scratch, in which case we have</span> <span data-start="123630">full control of the whole creative journey,</span> <span data-start="125970">from the build process, to the functionality of the app,</span> <span data-start="128789">to the look and feel.</span> <span data-start="130410">Or we can take advantage of some kind of Content Management</span> <span data-start="134610">System, or CMS for short, that are software platforms that</span> <span data-start="139590">add a layer of abstraction on top of the open web</span> <span data-start="142110">to offer capabilities to create, publish, and consume</span> <span data-start="145530">digital content on the web.</span> <span data-start="147540">If we follow the first route, we have full control and full</span> <span data-start="150780">flexibility.</span> <span data-start="151290">It's very powerful.</span> <span data-start="152130">But also, it requires a lot of expertise and resources</span> <span data-start="154950">to follow it.</span> <span data-start="155900">If we follow the second route, we</span> <span data-start="157560">can take advantage of the capabilities</span> <span data-start="159210">that the CMS has to offer to us.</span> <span data-start="160804">But then at the end of the day, the experience</span> <span data-start="162720">that we can offer to our users depends on the characteristic</span> <span data-start="166180">of the CMS that we choose.</span> <span data-start="169110">Now, it turns out that nowadays, the majority of content</span> <span data-start="173070">in the web is created and consumed</span> <span data-start="175740">via some kind of content management system.</span> <span data-start="177960">Specifically, 54% of sites today are</span> <span data-start="180870">built on some kind of content management system.</span> <span data-start="183460">And we saw this year 11% year over year growth.</span> <span data-start="186810">These are staggering statistics.</span> <span data-start="188780">And there are other systems that do not</span> <span data-start="190560">think of themselves as CMSes but also offer</span> <span data-start="193380">the same capabilities that make it very easy to create</span> <span data-start="195750">and publish content.</span> <span data-start="197110">So in reality, these statistics are much higher.</span> <span data-start="201010">So this basically means that the CMS space</span> <span data-start="203400">is very large and very complex.</span> <span data-start="206530">CMS comes in many shape and form.</span> <span data-start="208920">And they vary according to certain dimensions.</span> <span data-start="212760">For example, you can have static versus dynamic, open source,</span> <span data-start="215790">closed source, special purpose, general purpose.</span> <span data-start="218760">But although there are differences between them,</span> <span data-start="221640">they also share a lot of commonalities.</span> <span data-start="224130">And specifically, many of them face common challenges</span> <span data-start="228150">when it comes to integrating progressive web technologies</span> <span data-start="231300">into their platforms.</span> <span data-start="233650">So many of these systems are very large and complex.</span> <span data-start="236860">They have many interacting components.</span> <span data-start="238840">They have large code bases.</span> <span data-start="240580">They have legacy code, technical depth, and so on.</span> <span data-start="244360">There are also, some of them have</span> <span data-start="246160">evolved on top of initial architectural choices that</span> <span data-start="249160">make it difficult for them to evolve and become progressive.</span> <span data-start="253360">They also suffer from fragmentation</span> <span data-start="255490">very often in terms of things like the quality</span> <span data-start="257649">of the components that make them,</span> <span data-start="259420">or the expertise of the developer community,</span> <span data-start="261724">or the type of users that are creating and consuming</span> <span data-start="263890">content on the platform.</span> <span data-start="265900">And often —  and this is very important — </span> <span data-start="267730">CMSes lack the effective incentives for developers</span> <span data-start="272350">to do the right thing.</span> <span data-start="273730">For example, exposing coding and performance metrics</span> <span data-start="277750">so that users of the CMS can choose solutions</span> <span data-start="281350">based on quality and not just on popularity.</span> <span data-start="284370">Now, we want to tackle these challenges in the CMS space.</span> <span data-start="287430">And in order to reason about how to do</span> <span data-start="289210">that, it is very useful to do a [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span data-start="291070">or thinking about these systems in terms of the components that</span> <span data-start="294160">make them, OK?</span> <span data-start="296230">A CMS ecosystem, one way or another,</span> <span data-start="299590">has certain components that form a unique ecosystem for each</span> <span data-start="303760">of them.</span> <span data-start="304480">There is usually a core, a platform core,</span> <span data-start="307720">that makes the functionality of the system.</span> <span data-start="310260">There is usually some kind of extension mechanism</span> <span data-start="312910">that allows you to extend the core functionality.</span> <span data-start="315732">These extensions are usually called</span> <span data-start="317190">modules in some CMSes, plugins on another, also, themes,</span> <span data-start="321010">if they have to do with the look and feel of the system.</span> <span data-start="323610">There is usually a developers' community</span> <span data-start="325840">that are in charge of evolving both the core</span> <span data-start="328660">and the extensions of that platform.</span> <span data-start="330920">And then there is the user base of the CMS</span> <span data-start="332860">that are either creating content or consuming</span> <span data-start="335350">content on the platform.</span> <span data-start="338450">So when we talk about progressive content management</span> <span data-start="341020">systems, we are talking about bringing</span> <span data-start="342820">the principles of progressive web development</span> <span data-start="345010">to the components of each of these ecosystems, OK?</span> <span data-start="349660">For example, how do we bring coding and performance</span> <span data-start="352300">best practices to the developer ecosystem</span> <span data-start="355150">so that they can do the right thing?</span> <span data-start="357220">Can we bring tooling so that it make it easy</span> <span data-start="360880">for them to do the right thing in the first place?</span> <span data-start="364240">Or can we bring incentive mechanisms</span> <span data-start="366250">so that they are compelled to do the right thing?</span> <span data-start="369280">Now, Google is working with many CMSes</span> <span data-start="371590">to support them in their effort as they</span> <span data-start="373720">integrate progressive technologies</span> <span data-start="375550">into their platform.</span> <span data-start="376906">So in the next few slides, we are</span> <span data-start="378280">going to show you the results of a particular effort</span> <span data-start="380740">that my team has followed in the context of a specific CMS.</span> <span data-start="384654">And then later on, we are going to touch</span> <span data-start="386320">upon some of the great work done by other CMSes.</span> <span data-start="391840">Our team has been pursuing efforts</span> <span data-start="393280">to bring progressive web technologies to the WordPress</span> <span data-start="395650">ecosystems.</span> <span data-start="396300">The little fellow here there is Wapuu.</span> <span data-start="398680">That is the mascot of the WordPress ecosystem.</span> <span data-start="401150">It's not a mouse, although it looks like a mouse.</span> <span data-start="406300">So WordPress nowadays powers about a third of the web.</span> <span data-start="410770">So there's a lot of users creating and consuming</span> <span data-start="414100">content on this platform.</span> <span data-start="415390">Now, given the size and complexity of the WordPress</span> <span data-start="418450">ecosystem, if we address the challenges that they face,</span> <span data-start="422210">we will not have only an impact on a very large swath</span> <span data-start="424720">of the web, but also we will be able to shed light</span> <span data-start="427900">on how to address these challenges in other CMSes.</span> <span data-start="431030">So our goal with these efforts are twofold.</span> <span data-start="433460">One is to tackle the challenges that the WordPress</span> <span data-start="435790">ecosystem faces, and also to gather our learnings</span> <span data-start="439540">that we get along the way and bring them over to other CMSes</span> <span data-start="443470">in the form of objective guidance, tutorials, technology</span> <span data-start="446830">transfers, and so on.</span> <span data-start="448640">Now, the approach that we follow to make</span> <span data-start="452380">WordPress more progressive consists of two parts.</span> <span data-start="455150">The first part is leveraging the capabilities of Accelerated</span> <span data-start="459060">Mobile Pages, or AMP for short.</span> <span data-start="463510">AMP provides basically a well-lit path</span> <span data-start="466660">to modern web development in WordPress.</span> <span data-start="469105">AMP is an open-source web component library which</span> <span data-start="472720">provides out-of-the-box a set of capabilities and optimizations</span> <span data-start="477370">that are essential to achieve awesome web experiences</span> <span data-start="480310">in the web.</span> <span data-start="481382">For example, coding and performance</span> <span data-start="482840">best practices so that you don't get things</span> <span data-start="484810">like unresponsive content when you are loading it,</span> <span data-start="487990">or good usability so you don't have this constant shifting</span> <span data-start="491022">in front of your eyes when you are trying</span> <span data-start="492730">to engage with the content.</span> <span data-start="494720">It also provides a incentive mechanism —  for example,</span> <span data-start="498280">the capability of getting near instant loading</span> <span data-start="500890">time when AMP content is loaded from the AMP cache.</span> <span data-start="504610">And it also provides a validation framework</span> <span data-start="507700">that helps developers to bring their sites</span> <span data-start="511300">to high-performance states and to keep them</span> <span data-start="513640">in that state as the site evolves.</span> <span data-start="516220">So if we enable AMP content creation in WordPress,</span> <span data-start="520150">that means that WordPress developers</span> <span data-start="522039">can take advantage of all these capabilities</span> <span data-start="524590">without deviating of the normal content creation workflow</span> <span data-start="528070">that they follow in the platform normally.</span> <span data-start="530890">We have achieved this integration</span> <span data-start="532930">by means of an AMP plugin for WordPress.</span> <span data-start="536590">Right now, it is in version 1.0 release candidate 2.</span> <span data-start="540480">And the stable version will be released</span> <span data-start="542140">at the end of this month.</span> <span data-start="543840">Now, this plugin has a lot of capabilities and features.</span> <span data-start="546250">And unfortunately, we don't have time today to go over them</span> <span data-start="548860">in detail.</span> <span data-start="549650">But I want to mention a specific important one — </span> <span data-start="551920">one that assists WordPress developers as they</span> <span data-start="554590">build themes and plugins that are fully AMP compatible.</span> <span data-start="558470">The plugin comes with a compatibility tool</span> <span data-start="561190">that supports the development of AMP content in WordPress.</span> <span data-start="564310">In a nutshell, for any URL on a site,</span> <span data-start="568420">the plugin tells us all information</span> <span data-start="571930">about any error that can exist in that URL</span> <span data-start="574830">in very minute details.</span> <span data-start="577030">It tells you even the markup that</span> <span data-start="578920">is generating the error and also the component in the WordPress</span> <span data-start="583780">site that generated the markup in the first place.</span> <span data-start="586760">We'll see the theme.</span> <span data-start="587620">We'll see the plugin with WordPress core.</span> <span data-start="589870">What is it?</span> <span data-start="590930">So if you are a WordPress developer,</span> <span data-start="592960">you can take advantage of this tool and all</span> <span data-start="594880">the other capabilities that the plugin</span> <span data-start="596463">provides to you to create AMP content in your website.</span> <span data-start="601120">If you are a developer from other CMSes,</span> <span data-start="603850">the good news is that they are also implementing AMP.</span> <span data-start="607810">And we are going to tell you more</span> <span data-start="609220">about this in a little bit.</span> <span data-start="611110">Now, the second part of our approach</span> <span data-start="613210">of bringing progressive [? net ?] to the WordPress</span> <span data-start="615970">ecosystem consists on integrating modern web</span> <span data-start="619300">capabilities and APIs into WordPress core.</span> <span data-start="623170">We want things like service workers,</span> <span data-start="625510">streaming, background sync — </span> <span data-start="627340">all the goodies that you have seen today,</span> <span data-start="629140">we want them to be supported natively</span> <span data-start="631420">in the WordPress platform.</span> <span data-start="633050">So the goal of the integration is</span> <span data-start="634780">that there is a consistent and unified approach</span> <span data-start="637120">so that all WordPress developers can take advantage of them</span> <span data-start="640090">as they develop functionality for either core or themes</span> <span data-start="643060">or plugins.</span> <span data-start="644410">Now, last year, our colleague Surma,</span> <span data-start="648730">where you have heard of him, and who, by the way,</span> <span data-start="651190">has a complete disregard for the impossible,</span> <span data-start="653770">he decided to show that PWA with WordPress</span> <span data-start="657370">is actually possible by building a WordPress theme that does all</span> <span data-start="661300">the things, as he called it.</span> <span data-start="662890">He successfully proved his case.</span> <span data-start="665620">And he presented his work at CDS last year.</span> <span data-start="669130">But he also faced many challenges along the way.</span> <span data-start="671380">And he recognized that it would have</span> <span data-start="672880">been super great if the WordPress platform would have</span> <span data-start="676420">provided him with the building blocks</span> <span data-start="678100">that he needed to build his WordPress that</span> <span data-start="680680">does all the things in a much easier way.</span> <span data-start="683750">So in addition to our work on AMP for WordPress,</span> <span data-start="686170">our team focused this year on devising and implementing</span> <span data-start="689070">the integration of some of these building blocks</span> <span data-start="691690">into the WordPress core platform, OK?</span> <span data-start="695800">And we emphasize the requirement of doing</span> <span data-start="699220">that in a way that is seamlessly integrated with how WordPress</span> <span data-start="703390">worked in the first place.</span> <span data-start="705080">So I would like to call my teammate Weston to tell us more</span> <span data-start="708220">where we are in this effort.</span> <span data-start="710512">[APPLAUSE]</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="713398"><span class="speaker">Weston Ruter</span>: Gracias, Alberto.</span> <span data-start="716770">Yeah, Surma certainly did build a WordPress theme</span> <span data-start="719430">that did a lot of things.</span> <span data-start="721140">And he had a service worker that was installed by the theme.</span> <span data-start="724950">And that service worker powered things like offline reading</span> <span data-start="727530">and background sync.</span> <span data-start="729240">It facilitated smooth page transitions</span> <span data-start="731580">as you navigate around the site.</span> <span data-start="732960">And while his proof of concept was compelling,</span> <span data-start="736220">he faced a lot of challenges.</span> <span data-start="737890">And it was because WordPress didn't allow for doing things</span> <span data-start="743580">that he wanted to do.</span> <span data-start="746550">But these challenges are not unique to WordPress.</span> <span data-start="748860">They are common to other CMSes as well.</span> <span data-start="750692">So there are a few fundamental challenges</span> <span data-start="752400">that needed to be addressed.</span> <span data-start="753870">The first challenge is that there</span> <span data-start="755400">needs to be a central API in the CMS</span> <span data-start="760460">for generating a service worker.</span> <span data-start="762860">Because there wasn't this in WordPress,</span> <span data-start="765350">the theme itself had to generate the service worker.</span> <span data-start="767870">And this is a problem because as with Highlander,</span> <span data-start="770480">there can only be one service worker at a time.</span> <span data-start="773987">Multiple service workers could be installed,</span> <span data-start="775820">but only one is active.</span> <span data-start="777290">And so a CMS like WordPress needs</span> <span data-start="779690">to be able to generate that service worker centrally.</span> <span data-start="783370">The next challenge is that writing service worker logic</span> <span data-start="785830">can be complex and that the CMS should provide abstractions</span> <span data-start="791140">as a part of it that eliminate a lot of that boilerplate code</span> <span data-start="794110">that has to be repeated over and over again.</span> <span data-start="797410">And the last challenge, as Alberto referred to,</span> <span data-start="800060">is that WordPress extension system, and other CMSes</span> <span data-start="805800">as well, don't have sandboxing.</span> <span data-start="808470">And so a theme or [? flagging ?] can do things that make it</span> <span data-start="812580">difficult to maintain advanced capabilities like</span> <span data-start="815100">the [? actual ?] model.</span> <span data-start="816180">So we implemented abstractions in WordPress</span> <span data-start="818040">to solve these challenges.</span> <span data-start="819510">And what we did is applicable to more than just WordPress.</span> <span data-start="822900">First of all, we integrated the service worker API</span> <span data-start="825210">into WordPress so that themes and plugins can each include</span> <span data-start="828510">their own service worker logic and to be installed</span> <span data-start="832020">by the single service worker that is generated by the CMS.</span> <span data-start="835770">But this is just the base requirement.</span> <span data-start="838704">There also needs to be, as I said,</span> <span data-start="840120">those abstractions to make it easier</span> <span data-start="841980">to generate the complex logic that is needed</span> <span data-start="844200">to power a service worker.</span> <span data-start="846000">So our integration includes Workbox out of the box so that,</span> <span data-start="852390">as you've heard about earlier today,</span> <span data-start="854460">you can take advantage of all the complex logic</span> <span data-start="857520">for generating caching strategies and other advanced</span> <span data-start="860640">functionality, like background sync, that are part of Workbox,</span> <span data-start="863850">and so that you don't have to reinvent the wheel.</span> <span data-start="866990">And since WordPress developers have historically</span> <span data-start="869900">been PHP first developers, we have included PHP abstraction</span> <span data-start="875210">that allows you to write PHP instead of JavaScript</span> <span data-start="880580">so that you can have a PHP call that</span> <span data-start="882470">gets translated into the equivalent in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="886200">To give you a sense for how this API is used in WordPress,</span> <span data-start="889600">in this first example, you can see a caching strategy</span> <span data-start="893640">being leveraged —  here, staleWhileRevalidate — </span> <span data-start="896520">to match any request that is made to the AMP project CDN</span> <span data-start="902390">so that it will be then served from the cache while being</span> <span data-start="905530">updated in the background.</span> <span data-start="907620">And here, you can see a image being precached by the service</span> <span data-start="912250">worker and then served directly from the cache</span> <span data-start="915310">without hitting the network at all.</span> <span data-start="918280">And if these two examples here look familiar to you,</span> <span data-start="920830">then that is no mistake because they're essentially</span> <span data-start="923510">PHP versions of what you would be doing otherwise</span> <span data-start="925930">in JavaScript via Workbox.</span> <span data-start="928540">But if there is no abstraction in PHP for you to do that,</span> <span data-start="932240">you can also hook directly into the service worker</span> <span data-start="934480">to add your own arbitrary JavaScript to do more advanced</span> <span data-start="937570">functionality, if needed.</span> <span data-start="940960">So given these service worker capabilities,</span> <span data-start="943020">one common application is the App Shell model.</span> <span data-start="947720">And App Shell facilitates those seamless page transitions</span> <span data-start="952040">and offline interactions that you often see inside</span> <span data-start="955310">of native applications.</span> <span data-start="957890">But making a App Shell is often very difficult and challenging</span> <span data-start="961850">to do in WordPress because themes and plugins can</span> <span data-start="964200">add absolutely anything to the page, like I just said.</span> <span data-start="967070">And so this, again, is where the AMP plugin plays a key role</span> <span data-start="970460">because it enforces those constraints to make sure</span> <span data-start="972950">that the content behaves in a way that doesn't break the App</span> <span data-start="976140">Shell model.</span> <span data-start="977420">And AMP is also specifically designed</span> <span data-start="979220">to be embedded inside of these kinds of experiences.</span> <span data-start="983966">Here is the demonstration that we</span> <span data-start="985340">built that shows the standard theme 2017,</span> <span data-start="988160">with a nice spinning logo for fun.</span> <span data-start="989820">Keep watching that logo.</span> <span data-start="991880">Notice as I open the Nav menu and start clicking around,</span> <span data-start="996830">the content is changing.</span> <span data-start="999080">But the logo keeps spinning and is unchanged.</span> <span data-start="1003250">The header Nav menu remains expanded.</span> <span data-start="1006760">And you don't lose that context as you navigate around</span> <span data-start="1010431">the site.</span> <span data-start="1013830">So it's a single page application built in WordPress</span> <span data-start="1016800">using a standard theme as the basis.</span> <span data-start="1020780">And we could do it just with a minimal amount of code,</span> <span data-start="1023100">thanks to the foundation that the AMP plugin provides,</span> <span data-start="1026490">and the AMP project as well.</span> <span data-start="1028670">You can look at the pull request on the AMP plugin repo</span> <span data-start="1031849">to see more specifics on how you can</span> <span data-start="1033950">get started on your own themes.</span> <span data-start="1036230">To give you a glimpse of that, here you</span> <span data-start="1039819">can see the theme just has to declare theme support</span> <span data-start="1044010">to enforce those constraints.</span> <span data-start="1045430">To make sure that everything is available in AMP,</span> <span data-start="1049762">you have to make sure that the whole theme is able to serve</span> <span data-start="1052220">every page in AMP.</span> <span data-start="1053380">So you add this to your theme.</span> <span data-start="1057650">Next, you indicate the region in the template that</span> <span data-start="1061024">contains the content that dynamically changes as you</span> <span data-start="1063190">navigate around the site.</span> <span data-start="1066280">And lastly, you tell the AMP plugin</span> <span data-start="1068340">that you're opting into App Shell.</span> <span data-start="1070110">And then that then causes the AMP plugin to generate</span> <span data-start="1073770">the service worker logic to precache the App Shell</span> <span data-start="1076830">and to add the JavaScript to the page that will then</span> <span data-start="1078997">intercept the clicks, and do the history management,</span> <span data-start="1081163">and all that.</span> <span data-start="1082140">And the bottom line here is that the theme developer</span> <span data-start="1085259">doesn't have to know the complexities of building</span> <span data-start="1087300">App Shell.</span> <span data-start="1087900">They just extend what is already in the platform.</span> <span data-start="1092620">But a service worker is applicable to more than just</span> <span data-start="1095710">App Shell.</span> <span data-start="1096760">It also is useful for other advanced capabilities,</span> <span data-start="1099740">including offline access.</span> <span data-start="1103610">Often, if you've developed a WordPress theme,</span> <span data-start="1106100">you're familiar with the 404.php template,</span> <span data-start="1108990">which is used to serve a page to the user when WordPress</span> <span data-start="1112340">can't locate the site — </span> <span data-start="1113770">the content that you're trying to load.</span> <span data-start="1118430">And in the same way, we have extended WordPress's template</span> <span data-start="1121460">system to introduce an offline .php,</span> <span data-start="1124040">which will then be served to the user when the browser</span> <span data-start="1127400">can't access the site.</span> <span data-start="1128930">And so they get that nice branded experience</span> <span data-start="1131510">from the theme without the dinosaur.</span> <span data-start="1137170">And to opt into caching pages that you visited while online,</span> <span data-start="1144400">you can opt into that staleWhileRevalidate strategy</span> <span data-start="1147790">for navigation requests so that those</span> <span data-start="1150460">will continue to be available when you go offline.</span> <span data-start="1154070">And lastly, service worker is useful for commenting offline</span> <span data-start="1159080">as well.</span> <span data-start="1159630">So here, if I try to submit a comment while online — </span> <span data-start="1164560">or while offline —  then the service worker</span> <span data-start="1166920">can intercept that request and then replay it</span> <span data-start="1169230">when the user comes back online via background sync.</span> <span data-start="1172350">And here, the developer doesn't have</span> <span data-start="1173850">to do anything because it's just part of the integration itself.</span> <span data-start="1178410">So with that in mind, I'll pass it back to Alberto</span> <span data-start="1184310">to talk about the road ahead.</span> <span data-start="1189040">[APPLAUSE]</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1191490"><span class="speaker">Alberto Medina</span>: Thank you, Weston.</span> <span data-start="1192960">This is so very good to see all these things running.</span> <span data-start="1196020">And we certainly have made a lot of progress</span> <span data-start="1198330">in the context of WordPress.</span> <span data-start="1199710">And other CMSes have done also a lot of progress.</span> <span data-start="1202540">But we are still not quite where we need to be.</span> <span data-start="1205660">So in the context of WordPress, the unplugging</span> <span data-start="1209310">is available to you today.</span> <span data-start="1210690">You can download it from the GitHub link.</span> <span data-start="1212580">So please download this [INAUDIBLE] with your site.</span> <span data-start="1215896">We are going to continue expanding this work,</span> <span data-start="1217770">integrating AMP content creation into WordPress, specifically</span> <span data-start="1221400">in the context of Gutenberg.</span> <span data-start="1222780">That is the new editing experience in that platform.</span> <span data-start="1226410">In the area, you know, the integration of PWA, the service</span> <span data-start="1228870">workers, and all the PWA capabilities into WordPress</span> <span data-start="1232020">core, we have made a lot of progress.</span> <span data-start="1234240">Right now that functionality is available in the form</span> <span data-start="1237210">of a feature plugin that you can also download and experiment</span> <span data-start="1241790">if you are a WordPress developer.</span> <span data-start="1243229">And we are going to continue working with the WordPress</span> <span data-start="1245520">ecosystem to help them to integrate these technologies</span> <span data-start="1247890">into their work at all levels.</span> <span data-start="1250710">Now, one aspect that we are working that is very exciting</span> <span data-start="1254040">is enabling content creators to create content easily,</span> <span data-start="1258660">taking advantage of new powerful format, such as AMP Stories.</span> <span data-start="1264060">As you can see in this example, AMP Stories</span> <span data-start="1266310">is a mobile-focused format for delivering rich information</span> <span data-start="1270330">in terms of visually rich and tap-through stories.</span> <span data-start="1274320">We are building an AMP Stories editor</span> <span data-start="1275880">for WordPress, which is also integrated</span> <span data-start="1278160">with Gutenberg, the new editing experience of WordPress.</span> <span data-start="1280580">To give you a glimpse of where we are in this work,</span> <span data-start="1283260">these that you see here is all the Gutenberg editing</span> <span data-start="1286800">experience.</span> <span data-start="1287514">And the good thing about Gutenberg</span> <span data-start="1288930">is that everything corresponds to a blog.</span> <span data-start="1292440">And that design premise lends itself very well</span> <span data-start="1295980">to create AMP Stories that also form my component.</span> <span data-start="1299410">So the goal of the editor is to allow users to manipulate</span> <span data-start="1302790">all the components of an AMP Stories,</span> <span data-start="1304350">control the parameters, and so on.</span> <span data-start="1306990">We want powerful content formats like this</span> <span data-start="1309480">to become available across all CMSes.</span> <span data-start="1311909">And one interesting development that is happening</span> <span data-start="1313950">is that Gutenberg is being imported</span> <span data-start="1315930">to Drupal, which is another popular open-source CMS.</span> <span data-start="1319882">and this is great because then they</span> <span data-start="1321340">are going to be able to take advantage of this editor</span> <span data-start="1323910">right away.</span> <span data-start="1324450">So much more on this will be coming next year.</span> <span data-start="1327210">So stay tuned.</span> <span data-start="1329430">So to conclude, I can say that the CMS space is moving forward</span> <span data-start="1333270">steadily along the progressive web road.</span> <span data-start="1335700">Google is working and supporting many of CMS platforms</span> <span data-start="1338580">to help them advance in this path.</span> <span data-start="1341430">And we are seeing excellent results on some fronts.</span> <span data-start="1345000">Here, we have some examples.</span> <span data-start="1346170">Drupal, which I mentioned, is another popular open-source</span> <span data-start="1349690">CMS.</span> <span data-start="1350690">Their developer communities is working on the AMP and PWA</span> <span data-start="1354090">modules.</span> <span data-start="1354616">They are available in-site.</span> <span data-start="1355740">So they are working on enhancing them.</span> <span data-start="1358190">Magento, which is a popular e-commerce platform,</span> <span data-start="1360720">they are releasing Magento 2.3 this month.</span> <span data-start="1363570">And that release includes PWS Studio,</span> <span data-start="1365940">that is a set of guidelines and tools</span> <span data-start="1369000">to be able to create awesome web experience in their platform.</span> <span data-start="1372150">Adobe Experience Manager, which is a popular CMS</span> <span data-start="1375450">in the enterprise arena — </span> <span data-start="1377640">they have allowed the creation of and publishing</span> <span data-start="1380100">of single-page applications directly from the page editor.</span> <span data-start="1383250">And they are working on also providing service worker</span> <span data-start="1385650">integration natively in their platform early next year.</span> <span data-start="1390060">At the end we have EC-CUBE.</span> <span data-start="1391440">That is one of the leading e-commerce platforms in Japan.</span> <span data-start="1394574">They are working with an agency that is called [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span data-start="1396990">on an AMP plugin that would also enable the creation of AMP</span> <span data-start="1399780">content on their platform.</span> <span data-start="1401590">So we want to extend special thanks</span> <span data-start="1403740">to XWP, which is an excellent WordPress agency that</span> <span data-start="1406054">has been partnering with us.</span> <span data-start="1407220">And they have made awesome contributions</span> <span data-start="1409200">in the areas of bringing AMP and PWA technologies</span> <span data-start="1411930">to the WordPress platform.</span> <span data-start="1413520">With that, I want to say thank you.</span> <span data-start="1415110">And stay tuned for more progress coming soon to a CMS near you.</span> <span data-start="1418490">[APPLAUSE]</span> <span data-start="1419090">[MUSIC PLAYING]</span> </section>
