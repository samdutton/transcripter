<section><span data-start="7142"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: Well, we are excited because nobody likes</span> <span data-start="9600">to wait, and we want to talk to you about all</span> <span data-start="11940">of the optimizations and measurement tools</span> <span data-start="14670">that we have been working on and can provide to you.</span> <span data-start="18000">And we're going to start with going over</span> <span data-start="22530">an overview of user metrics, kind of what we care about</span> <span data-start="25110">and why, then looking at the latest developments</span> <span data-start="27450">in Lighthouse, the Chrome UX Report, or CrUX,</span> <span data-start="30690">and talk about how we're unifying tooling</span> <span data-start="32729">across the board.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="34290"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: All right, so when it comes to web performance,</span> <span data-start="37910">one thing you could say is you can't</span> <span data-start="39720">improve what you don't measure.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="41740"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: This was Peter Drucker, right?</span> <span data-start="43740">He was a management guy?</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="44844"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: This is actually true.</span> <span data-start="46260">Peter Drucker —  really, really well known kind</span> <span data-start="49750">of business management guru.</span> <span data-start="52722">To be honest, I think he might have</span> <span data-start="54180">been a front-end developer, as well,</span> <span data-start="56520">but this is just absolutely true.</span> <span data-start="58810">If you want to make something better, step one is measure it.</span> <span data-start="62670">And let's get into that with web performance.</span> <span data-start="65840">To measure, we need to look at some metrics.</span> <span data-start="68910">And it's really important to make sure</span> <span data-start="70920">that your metrics are user centric and really focused</span> <span data-start="74621">on the user.</span> <span data-start="75120">We heard a little bit ago about pending wait time and some</span> <span data-start="79110">of those custom metrics, but we'd</span> <span data-start="80880">like to have metrics that really focus</span> <span data-start="82530">on how the user experience is.</span> <span data-start="85037">So let's take a page load, break it down, and look</span> <span data-start="87120">at a few key metrics in here.</span> <span data-start="89340">So a little film strip here.</span> <span data-start="91530">We're loading a search result page.</span> <span data-start="93610">And so we just have a little progression of a few images,</span> <span data-start="96510">getting to our final result or where the page is done loading.</span> <span data-start="100380">Now, underneath the things that we see visually</span> <span data-start="103710">is a few things happening.</span> <span data-start="105230">There's the main thread and network requests,</span> <span data-start="109150">and these are really important, too,</span> <span data-start="110650">because it actually weighs in a lot on the actual user</span> <span data-start="113490">experience.</span> <span data-start="114231">So I want to point a few things out here, the first of which</span> <span data-start="116730">is this point right here.</span> <span data-start="118175">This is the first time that text shows up on the page.</span> <span data-start="120930">It's first time the content is there.</span> <span data-start="122490">So we call this, the duration from the navigation</span> <span data-start="126660">to the point at which text shows up, the first contentful paint.</span> <span data-start="131360">Easy enough —  I think we know this one.</span> <span data-start="133540">A little bit later though, you can</span> <span data-start="135060">see right after the main thread kind of quiets down a bit,</span> <span data-start="138780">this right here is important moment.</span> <span data-start="141900">All the long tasks in the main thread have done,</span> <span data-start="143910">so the main thread has kind of quieted down and allowed</span> <span data-start="147960">the page to now be responsive to users</span> <span data-start="150810">once they choose to interact with it.</span> <span data-start="152850">Also, the network is quiet, so we</span> <span data-start="154680">know there's no one big massive script hanging out</span> <span data-start="159750">ready to run and take up time in the main thread.</span> <span data-start="161910">So the duration from navigation to this point,</span> <span data-start="164520">we call this time to interactive.</span> <span data-start="166700">All right, and there's one more key metric</span> <span data-start="168450">I want to cover real quick.</span> <span data-start="169950">Now, in this page load, a user could really</span> <span data-start="175710">touch the screen at any point.</span> <span data-start="177840">They could interact with it here once there's</span> <span data-start="180090">a paint on screen or a little bit later,</span> <span data-start="183750">but let's just say for the purposes of this,</span> <span data-start="186540">they tap the screen at this point.</span> <span data-start="188600">Now, the thing is, if they tap the screen at this point,</span> <span data-start="191640">take a look at what's happening on the main thread — </span> <span data-start="193920">a lot of things.</span> <span data-start="194620">We're in the middle of a big long task.</span> <span data-start="197960">And that means the page is not going to be</span> <span data-start="199710">able to respond to the user.</span> <span data-start="202090">So we have to wait a little bit until the page can actually</span> <span data-start="204960">respond.</span> <span data-start="205950">So this duration, the time from the input</span> <span data-start="208980">until the end of the long task that we're dealing with,</span> <span data-start="211870">we call this the first input delay.</span> <span data-start="214774">This is an important metric, and I</span> <span data-start="216190">want to spend a little bit more time on it.</span> <span data-start="219880">If this is a main thread, well, it's</span> <span data-start="222330">a very open and available main thread.</span> <span data-start="224400">Really, nothing happening.</span> <span data-start="226150">So let's say if the user had some input, well, piece</span> <span data-start="230670">of cake, we can just reply to it immediately.</span> <span data-start="233370">Your event handler is going to run, touch, start, or click,</span> <span data-start="236070">or you're going to do style, and layout,</span> <span data-start="237736">and paint, and ship a frame.</span> <span data-start="239250">They're going to see something.</span> <span data-start="240541">So if, let's say, they're tapping on the Menu icon</span> <span data-start="243610">and then the menu slides out, so we're good.</span> <span data-start="246790">But if there is one task sitting on the main thread,</span> <span data-start="251730">well, we're just going to have to wait.</span> <span data-start="253740">So we always, yes, we'll be doing the event handling,</span> <span data-start="257279">but this time between when the inputs's first received</span> <span data-start="260820">and when the events will be dispatched,</span> <span data-start="265140">that is the input delay.</span> <span data-start="266910">First input delay is just the first input of the page.</span> <span data-start="270240">It's just the first time that a user touches the page.</span> <span data-start="272490">And the important thing here is that first input delay</span> <span data-start="275520">is a field metric.</span> <span data-start="279000">It really only makes sense to gather in the field.</span> <span data-start="283300">Time to interactive is a great and really powerful metric,</span> <span data-start="286410">but it makes sense mostly in the lab, in a lab scenario.</span> <span data-start="289230">And we've recognized this, that basically time to interactive</span> <span data-start="292470">out in the field where real users are tapping on the screen</span> <span data-start="295470">as the page is loading, it really kind of messes</span> <span data-start="298350">with this metric.</span> <span data-start="300550">So there's a few metrics on the screen</span> <span data-start="302400">here basically just outlining which</span> <span data-start="305580">makes sense to gather in the lab,</span> <span data-start="307806">and then some that are only exclusive in the field.</span> <span data-start="309930">So I want to point out TTI and First Input Delay or FID are</span> <span data-start="314670">our interactivity metrics — </span> <span data-start="316140">really key for understanding how available the main thread is</span> <span data-start="320730">to the user.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="322140"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: OK, so all of these metrics</span> <span data-start="324450">are awesome, obviously, but where can</span> <span data-start="326460">we actually find them?</span> <span data-start="327630">So all three of these metrics are</span> <span data-start="329040">readily available in their respective lab and field</span> <span data-start="331350">environments.</span> <span data-start="332340">So as Paul was saying, because FCP</span> <span data-start="334710">can be measured in both the lab and in the field</span> <span data-start="337260">with real users, it's available across the board.</span> <span data-start="339610">So that's in Lighthouse, in the Chrome User Experience</span> <span data-start="342210">Report or CrUX, and there's a web perf API.</span> <span data-start="346060">TTI is only available in the lab,</span> <span data-start="348150">and so can only be accessed via Lighthouse and Page Speed</span> <span data-start="350910">Insights.</span> <span data-start="352260">Now, FID requires real user input to measure,</span> <span data-start="355250">so it's available in CrUX.</span> <span data-start="357270">And FID is exciting because it's actually</span> <span data-start="359490">going to be coming to Chrome in Q4 or early Q1</span> <span data-start="362820">as a web perf API.</span> <span data-start="364260">So it should be able to give you a — </span> <span data-start="367821">you can view it in a Performance Observer,</span> <span data-start="369570">just as you get FCP today, which is kind of cool.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="371852"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: Super cool.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="372810"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: Yeah.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="373120"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: Yeah, excited about standardization of this stuff.</span> <span data-start="375840">It's really exciting.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="377612"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: So for those of you who</span> <span data-start="379320">aren't familiar with Lighthouse, and we know that it's awesome</span> <span data-start="382320">and a lot of people know, but Lighthouse</span> <span data-start="384300">is an open source automated tool for improving</span> <span data-start="386910">the quality of web pages.</span> <span data-start="388320">So you can run it against any web page,</span> <span data-start="390910">and that's either public or requiring authentication,</span> <span data-start="393900">and it has audits for performance, accessibility,</span> <span data-start="396730">PWA, and more.</span> <span data-start="399422">I'm excited to tell you about some things</span> <span data-start="401130">that we've been doing with Lighthouse.</span> <span data-start="402713">So one of those things is a PWA refactor.</span> <span data-start="406110">So currently, there is a broad spectrum</span> <span data-start="408510">of PWA definitions in the wild that</span> <span data-start="411570">can make it difficult to identify whether or not,</span> <span data-start="414420">definitively, you are a PWA.</span> <span data-start="416970">And while our PWA checklist is absolutely wonderful,</span> <span data-start="419730">and it gives you no helpful guidance towards what a PWA is,</span> <span data-start="423840">we want a machine verifiable way to say yes or no.</span> <span data-start="427830">So today, we're launching the new Lighthouse UI</span> <span data-start="430770">with a more binary badging system for the PWA category.</span> <span data-start="436260">And the badge groupings reflect that we want everybody</span> <span data-start="440010">to be able to achieve the fast and reliable badge.</span> <span data-start="442260">All experiences should be that whether or not</span> <span data-start="444570">you're installable or not.</span> <span data-start="445890">In order to actually become a full PWA and get that badge,</span> <span data-start="450180">you have to successfully fulfill all audits in the categories.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="455262"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: Yeah.</span> <span data-start="455970">There's a few more things that we've been doing.</span> <span data-start="458106">And in the new 4.0, 4.0 alpha that's</span> <span data-start="463200">coming out in Lighthouse, there's a few nice changes</span> <span data-start="466239">that we made.</span> <span data-start="466780">So one of the things that we've been working on</span> <span data-start="467970">is reducing the amount of time that it</span> <span data-start="469553">takes to run Lighthouse.</span> <span data-start="471320">Nobody wants to sit around waiting for a long time.</span> <span data-start="473550">So we're happy to report that the median runtime</span> <span data-start="475710">of all Lighthouse runs that we're aware of has dropped down</span> <span data-start="478740">about 50%, and up the 90th percentile,</span> <span data-start="481170">we've also dropped this down about 66%.</span> <span data-start="483294">So we're really jazzed about this.</span> <span data-start="484710">We want to make sure that it's not</span> <span data-start="486510">a long wait for you to get the insights that are available.</span> <span data-start="490910">A few more changes — </span> <span data-start="493200">we've changed how scores are kind of represented.</span> <span data-start="497100">So if you've seen kind of at the top of a Lighthouse report</span> <span data-start="499800">these score gauges, right beneath them</span> <span data-start="503130">is this little scale, right?</span> <span data-start="505230">So this is just how the numeric scale is mapped to a color.</span> <span data-start="509040">We made a change here.</span> <span data-start="510444">And I just want to point out, none</span> <span data-start="511860">of the numerical scores and those calculations</span> <span data-start="515010">have changed in this new update.</span> <span data-start="516600">It's just deciding which color is applied.</span> <span data-start="520840">So this is basically the change.</span> <span data-start="523620">We've just adjusted how the various numerical scores</span> <span data-start="528660">map to these colors.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="529610"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: Yeah, so basically, we're</span> <span data-start="530790">raising the bar about what our expectations are</span> <span data-start="533040">for a performance site.</span> <span data-start="534019">But if you're in the green, you should feel really good</span> <span data-start="536310">about it.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="537310"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: Yeah, it's good.</span> <span data-start="538860">I know a lot of — </span> <span data-start="539670">yeah, it's nice to go for the 100.</span> <span data-start="542820">I love the 100.</span> <span data-start="544770">I'm excited about it.</span> <span data-start="546050">But, yeah, if you're in the green, you're good,</span> <span data-start="548834">so I just want to make that clear.</span> <span data-start="550250">All right, sweet.</span> <span data-start="552400">Now, there's a few more changes, and this one about throttling — </span> <span data-start="556272">when it comes the throttling, a good mobile-throttling preset</span> <span data-start="559560">shouldn't necessarily map to the particular conditions</span> <span data-start="563880">of a telecommunications system and its specification.</span> <span data-start="567620">A good preset maps to what real users feel.</span> <span data-start="571770">And so really, what we want to do</span> <span data-start="573390">is we want to capture the latency and throughput</span> <span data-start="575910">at the 80th percentile, the frustrating experiences</span> <span data-start="579090">that you oftentimes experience.</span> <span data-start="583160">And we want to keep pace with this measurement</span> <span data-start="588600">as our global telecommunications infrastructure gets upgraded.</span> <span data-start="592650">A lot of people are moving from 3G to 4G,</span> <span data-start="595320">and we want to make sure that we capture that.</span> <span data-start="597980">And so we're making a change, but actually not in the latency</span> <span data-start="602910">and throughput numbers.</span> <span data-start="604120">This is actually just a labeling change.</span> <span data-start="606010">So wherever you see fast 3G today,</span> <span data-start="609810">you'll be seeing slow 4G.</span> <span data-start="612120">And it's actually because the preset that we use actually</span> <span data-start="615540">captures a 4G experience more than a 3G experience.</span> <span data-start="619630">So just FYI, same stuff — </span> <span data-start="623100">different now.</span> <span data-start="623780">It's all good.</span> <span data-start="626340">What's next?</span> <span data-start="627120">Oh, yeah, so there's a few other things going on</span> <span data-start="630000">with Lighthouse, really nice projects making use of it.</span> <span data-start="632610">First up, check out some of the projects</span> <span data-start="634860">on GitHub taking advantage of Lighthouse,</span> <span data-start="637020">some of the dependent projects.</span> <span data-start="638427">Really cool stuff in here.</span> <span data-start="639510">A lot happening in the recent months.</span> <span data-start="642210">Many projects building systems around using Lighthouse</span> <span data-start="647070">in a continuous integration experience</span> <span data-start="648930">so that on every commit, you run Lighthouse, store</span> <span data-start="651570">all that data, get graphs — </span> <span data-start="652890">some really cool stuff happening in here, so take a look.</span> <span data-start="656594">Lighthouse is also available in a number</span> <span data-start="658260">of different commercial products as well.</span> <span data-start="661660">First is Calibre —  fantastic stuff here.</span> <span data-start="665340">Treo is another one.</span> <span data-start="667240">I think this is my site, which is doing OK.</span> <span data-start="671460">Accessibility actually does need some work,</span> <span data-start="674580">but there's some nice stuff.</span> <span data-start="676040">And the last is SpeedCurve, which</span> <span data-start="677520">actually just added support for Lighthouse</span> <span data-start="680400">just a few months ago.</span> <span data-start="681370">So we're excited to see Lighthouse</span> <span data-start="683280">becoming part of the production monitoring kind of ecosystem.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="686667"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: And even internally, we're</span> <span data-start="688500">excited to see where Lighthouse is being integrated.</span> <span data-start="690910">So one of those examples, as was announced in the keynote,</span> <span data-start="693840">is the new site web.dev.</span> <span data-start="696300">And it's exciting to be integrating it</span> <span data-start="699480">with really prescriptive, actionable guidance.</span> <span data-start="702540">And you can run Lighthouse with any URL,</span> <span data-start="705420">and it will provide you with a prioritized to-do list</span> <span data-start="708990">with that guidance and interactive code</span> <span data-start="711690">labs for the specific things that you need to work on.</span> <span data-start="715140">What's so exciting about this is that for the first time,</span> <span data-start="718230">tooling is directly integrated with the documentation.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="722698"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: Yeah, that's pretty hot.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="724410"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: And we wanted to also call out</span> <span data-start="726540">another wonderful partner who has done</span> <span data-start="729000">a good job of using Lighthouse.</span> <span data-start="731070">So Squarespace was able to use Lighthouse as an out-of-the-box</span> <span data-start="736020">auditing and reporting system to build on top of.</span> <span data-start="738090">And it allowed them to improve their 50th percentile</span> <span data-start="740700">and 95th percentile TTI by over three times,</span> <span data-start="743820">so we were super excited by that.</span> <span data-start="745680">They used it to generate traces and dig that deep</span> <span data-start="748200">into specific problems as they happened,</span> <span data-start="750600">as opposed to post progression.</span> <span data-start="754920">So now, we are going to talk a little bit about the Chrome</span> <span data-start="758370">User Experience Report, or as it says,</span> <span data-start="760320">CrUX, as I've already said, I think, three times.</span> <span data-start="763920">CrUX actually provides user experience metrics</span> <span data-start="766500">for how real world Chrome users experience popular destinations</span> <span data-start="771030">on the web.</span> <span data-start="771880">So it's a data set that is powered by real user</span> <span data-start="774210">measurement by key user metrics across the public web,</span> <span data-start="778890">and it's aggregated anonymously from users who have opted in.</span> <span data-start="782842">We're excited to talk about some of the updates</span> <span data-start="784800">that we've done here.</span> <span data-start="786487">One of the things, and it was actually</span> <span data-start="788070">featured in [? Aanchal's ?] talk earlier, is regional analysis.</span> <span data-start="791350">So we heard loud and clear from developers</span> <span data-start="793890">that we needed to be able to break down</span> <span data-start="796140">this data set in a country specific way,</span> <span data-start="798450">and now you can do that.</span> <span data-start="799590">So via BigQuery, which is where you can interact and play</span> <span data-start="802800">with this data set you can now get separate country</span> <span data-start="806400">specific data sets to pull it apart.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="809135"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: And, yeah, so this is</span> <span data-start="810510">just —  this is how you've been interacting</span> <span data-start="812260">with Chrome UX Report in the past is working with BigQuery.</span> <span data-start="816600">But I heard that there's like a nice, new, shiny thing?</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="819440"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: Yeah.</span> <span data-start="820580">You can get it way easier now.</span> <span data-start="822480">So the brand new CrUX dashboard, which</span> <span data-start="825150">was announced just a bit ago, it allows</span> <span data-start="826980">you to understand how an origin's performance evolves</span> <span data-start="830070">over time.</span> <span data-start="831340">And so it's built on Data Studio.</span> <span data-start="833010">It's much more easily accessible,</span> <span data-start="835440">and it can be easily customized and shared</span> <span data-start="838740">with everyone on your team.</span> <span data-start="840200">And it doesn't require you to write your own script</span> <span data-start="842370">on BigQuery to access it.</span> <span data-start="844230">And it's automatically synced with all the latest data</span> <span data-start="846480">sets, so you're good to go.</span> <span data-start="849430">Also, to ensure consistency across all of our tooling,</span> <span data-start="851730">as we've mentioned, that's a huge goal for us,</span> <span data-start="854040">FID is now launched as an experimental metric in CrUX.</span> <span data-start="860160">So when we announced last year, the data set only</span> <span data-start="863550">had 10,000 origins, and now we are at over 4 million.</span> <span data-start="868510">And if you are excited to see your websites — </span> </section>

<section><span data-start="872460"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: I am excited to see paulirish.com in this data set.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="875500"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: Yeah.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="875780"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: Because it's not, and it would be great.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="877300"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: Yeah, we're working hard</span> <span data-start="879050">to improve it, and expand quickly,</span> <span data-start="881080">and so if you're excited, check in</span> <span data-start="882570">soon because we are working hard to move fast.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="884570"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: Awesome.</span> <span data-start="886490">All right, so one of the things that's really important to us</span> <span data-start="890310">is to have a unified story between our performance tools.</span> <span data-start="896060">So, OK, so hand raising time.</span> <span data-start="898740">Raise your hand if you've used Lighthouse.</span> <span data-start="900908">All right, yes.</span> <span data-start="902700">Raise your hand if you've used Page Speed Insights.</span> <span data-start="905760">Yes, of course.</span> <span data-start="907500">Raise your hand if you've noticed</span> <span data-start="909540">that what you're seeing in Lighthouse and Page</span> <span data-start="911910">Speed Insights doesn't necessarily</span> <span data-start="913380">be telling the same story.</span> <span data-start="915930">Yeah, I'm there with you too.</span> <span data-start="918100">Now, we saw this was a bit of an issue,</span> <span data-start="920970">and we wanted to improve it because we don't want advice</span> <span data-start="925620">from two different tools that Google provides</span> <span data-start="927810">that is kind of conflicting.</span> <span data-start="930100">So we've been working hard and collaborating</span> <span data-start="932310">with the Search team on this.</span> <span data-start="934870">And so today, we're excited to announce</span> <span data-start="937500">that there's a brand new next generation of Page Speed</span> <span data-start="940080">Insights now powered by Lighthouse.</span> <span data-start="944224">And this is really exciting stuff.</span> <span data-start="945640">So now, if you use Page Speed Insights,</span> <span data-start="947834">all of the data that you've been seeing in Lighthouse when</span> <span data-start="950250">it comes to performance is now in the report.</span> <span data-start="953400">All of the metrics, and [? op trees, ?] and diagnostics</span> <span data-start="956490">all right there.</span> <span data-start="957840">You also see the top score that you have been</span> <span data-start="961170">seeing in Page Speed Insights.</span> <span data-start="962550">That score is the Lighthouse performance category score,</span> <span data-start="965770">so kind of speaking the same language.</span> <span data-start="968740">And still, if you've really enjoyed kind of the Chrome UX</span> <span data-start="972060">Report data that has been available inside</span> <span data-start="975990">of Page Speed Insights, that's there too.</span> <span data-start="978330">I'm going to play a quick little screencast of how this looks.</span> <span data-start="981580">So let's take a look at Chrome.com</span> <span data-start="985310">in Page Speed Insights.</span> <span data-start="987170">We're going.</span> <span data-start="988840">Come on.</span> <span data-start="990060">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="990990">Great, good, awesome.</span> <span data-start="992700">This is in real time.</span> <span data-start="993610">I did not speed anything up, so we've</span> <span data-start="995550">got to wait for the latency.</span> <span data-start="997560">So, yeah, so here's — </span> <span data-start="999019">this should look very fairly familiar</span> <span data-start="1000560">if you've used Lighthouse.</span> <span data-start="1002510">But up at the top, we have field data.</span> <span data-start="1004850">And by default, paid speed on sites</span> <span data-start="1006770">runs both analysis on mobile and desktop at the same time,</span> <span data-start="1011840">delivers you the results simultaneously.</span> <span data-start="1014620">So you can check that out.</span> <span data-start="1016830">So this is live today, so go check it out.</span> <span data-start="1020130">Take a look.</span> <span data-start="1020990">Give us your feedback I'm excited to have this out there.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1025510"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: All right, thanks.</span> <span data-start="1026579">Oh, yeah, I mean, you can clap if you want.</span> <span data-start="1028250">I mean, that's cool.</span> <span data-start="1029083">[APPLAUSE]</span> <span data-start="1033569">All right, and if you've ever actually opened up — </span> <span data-start="1037500">I don't know.</span> <span data-start="1039204">I have a tendency of opening up the dev tools on basically</span> <span data-start="1041700">every site that I do.</span> <span data-start="1043129">You know, it's just a habit.</span> <span data-start="1045630">So I opened up the dev tools on Page Speed Insights, and lo</span> <span data-start="1048719">and behold, it's just a thin web app that</span> <span data-start="1051780">makes a call to an API, a RESTful API,</span> <span data-start="1054585">and it's actually the Page Speed Insights API.</span> <span data-start="1058650">So we were like, well, this kind of means</span> <span data-start="1062670">that in order to do this, then we're</span> <span data-start="1064170">going to have to have all the Lighthouse</span> <span data-start="1065836">data available over the API.</span> <span data-start="1068192">So that's what we have.</span> <span data-start="1069150">The new Page Speed API V5, we consider it the Lighthouse API</span> <span data-start="1073770">V1.</span> <span data-start="1075150">All the same Lighthouse data, including all categories, not</span> <span data-start="1078660">just performance, but all of them.</span> <span data-start="1080940">And all the work is done for you.</span> <span data-start="1082315">No waiting for your own Chrome to reload and do the analysis.</span> <span data-start="1086260">So we'll do the work for you.</span> <span data-start="1088660">And the Chrome UX Report data, that summary is still in — </span> <span data-start="1096300">it's added into the response.</span> <span data-start="1098250">That's the word.</span> <span data-start="1100950">Basic usage —  I don't know if you'd use it from fetch client</span> <span data-start="1103800">side, but if you did, it would look something like this.</span> <span data-start="1107760">Well, just pass the URL.</span> <span data-start="1108870">There's a few other parameters customize things.</span> <span data-start="1110870">Get back the result. Looks a little like this.</span> <span data-start="1113730">There's a Lighthouse result full of the exact same Lighthouse</span> <span data-start="1116670">data that you'd be getting by running Lighthouse</span> <span data-start="1120510">anywhere else.</span> <span data-start="1121640">And inside that loading experience property,</span> <span data-start="1124020">that is the Chrome UX Report stuff.</span> <span data-start="1126630">So really cool, check it out.</span> <span data-start="1129270">Details and documentations, reference guides here — </span> <span data-start="1134820">Page Speed Insights V5.</span> <span data-start="1138180">All right.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1138705"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: And so this is really cool.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1140580"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: It's really cool.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1141090"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: Yeah, it means all unified analysis,</span> <span data-start="1143520">and it's the same.</span> <span data-start="1144300">So when you're measuring, you're optimizing.</span> <span data-start="1146280">You're monitoring.</span> <span data-start="1147660">If you want to start making changes and testing things out,</span> <span data-start="1150570">there's a place for you to go for that.</span> <span data-start="1152560">So that's great, and we have all of these things aligned,</span> <span data-start="1155970">but where do you go for what?</span> <span data-start="1157942">And when should you go there?</span> <span data-start="1164940">If you need a snapshot of a page's performance,</span> <span data-start="1167070">as Paul said earlier, Page Speed Insights</span> <span data-start="1169350">is a good default to go to because it provides you</span> <span data-start="1171960">with both the field and the lab and gives you a good benchmark.</span> <span data-start="1175530">If you want to make changes, test, and iterate,</span> <span data-start="1178200">and really have that fast feedback,</span> <span data-start="1180390">then the Chrome extension, the audits panel,</span> <span data-start="1182820">or operating within the command line interface</span> <span data-start="1185220">is going to be a good place to go.</span> <span data-start="1187750">And finally, if you want to set up production monitoring or set</span> <span data-start="1191340">budgets, then the API is going to be fantastic.</span> <span data-start="1194590">But across the entire development lifecycle,</span> <span data-start="1197070">you now are completely powered by Lighthouse, which</span> <span data-start="1199860">we're super excited about.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1201940"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: Yeah.</span> <span data-start="1203370">So to wrap up, well, I guess if there's</span> <span data-start="1206550">one thing or four things that you take away from this — </span> <span data-start="1210150">first up, measure well, measure often.</span> <span data-start="1213780">You can't approve what you don't measure.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1215610"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: Yep.</span> <span data-start="1218140">You can now use the Page Speed Insights</span> <span data-start="1220210">for quick Lighthouse analysis.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1223990"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: The CrUX real world data really</span> <span data-start="1226810">helps round out your view of what's</span> <span data-start="1230410">happening with your users and really understand</span> <span data-start="1233170">different percentiles where users are</span> <span data-start="1235780">feeling pain and frustration.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1237940"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: And finally, to evaluate performance</span> <span data-start="1240280">at every stage, which is really important to us,</span> <span data-start="1243585">you can now check out the API, so go use it.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1247260"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: All right, I think that's it.</span> <span data-start="1248990">Thank you guys very much.</span> </section>
