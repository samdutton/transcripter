<section><span data-start="7.01" data-end="8.27"><span class="speaker">Surma</span>: Hello, everybody.</span> <span data-start="8.27" data-end="9.14">Yes, it's me again.</span> <span data-start="9.14" data-end="10.175">Prepare for more bugs.</span> <span data-start="12.225" data-end="14.6">I'm kind of excited to be here because we finally reached</span> <span data-start="14.6" data-end="20.96">a point where, with Houdini, I can talk about actual APIs.</span> <span data-start="20.96" data-end="22.91">Because they're starting to land, and that's</span> <span data-start="22.91" data-end="25.16">kind of really exciting.</span> <span data-start="25.16" data-end="29.122">But as with any talk, I have to start with what Houdini is.</span> <span data-start="29.122" data-end="31.58">Because on my Twitter, I often see there's still confusion.</span> <span data-start="31.58" data-end="34.19">Because it turns out there's a software called Houdini.</span> <span data-start="34.19" data-end="37.59">There is apparently a magician that was called Houdini.</span> <span data-start="37.59" data-end="42.27">So I want to clear up what Houdini really is about.</span> <span data-start="42.27" data-end="47.117">So every browser has more or less four major stages</span> <span data-start="47.117" data-end="48.2">in the rendering pipeline.</span> <span data-start="48.2" data-end="51.11">It starts with styles, where the browser collects all the style</span> <span data-start="51.11" data-end="53.12">sheets that are in the document and then figures</span> <span data-start="53.12" data-end="57.2">out which element is affected by which of these styles.</span> <span data-start="57.2" data-end="59.75">And now that we know the width, the height,</span> <span data-start="59.75" data-end="64.459">and if it's Flexbox or Grid, which style is on which</span> <span data-start="64.459" data-end="65.72">element, we can do layout.</span> <span data-start="65.72" data-end="68.42">We can basically calculate how big an element is</span> <span data-start="68.42" data-end="73.04">and align them on the page and get boxes on the page.</span> <span data-start="73.04" data-end="74.8">They are still empty and transparent</span> <span data-start="74.8" data-end="77.9">because in the next stage we can take that layout page</span> <span data-start="77.9" data-end="79.962">and paint it, just draw it.</span> <span data-start="79.962" data-end="81.42">And we can draw it all on the page.</span> <span data-start="81.42" data-end="84.3">Sometimes elements get on their own piece of paper,</span> <span data-start="84.3" data-end="86.3">which is called a layer.</span> <span data-start="86.3" data-end="88.16">And once we are done painting, respecting</span> <span data-start="88.16" data-end="90.8">things like background color and the text color and the border</span> <span data-start="90.8" data-end="93.92">color, we can give all of that, all this pieces of paper</span> <span data-start="93.92" data-end="96.77">to the compositor and put them together in the page</span> <span data-start="96.77" data-end="98.497">that you will see on your screen.</span> <span data-start="98.497" data-end="100.08">And if something was on its own layer,</span> <span data-start="100.08" data-end="101.704">we can move the pieces of paper around.</span> <span data-start="101.704" data-end="103.255">And that's how animations are made.</span> <span data-start="103.255" data-end="104.63">It's obviously kind of a shortcut</span> <span data-start="104.63" data-end="107.79">but you can see where I'm coming from.</span> <span data-start="107.79" data-end="109.29">So bringing it back to the question,</span> <span data-start="109.29" data-end="110.57">what really is Houdini?</span> <span data-start="110.57" data-end="113.99">Well, Houdini is a standards effort in the CSS working</span> <span data-start="113.99" data-end="118.49">group in the W3C to expose hooks into these major stages</span> <span data-start="118.49" data-end="121.22">of the layout phase to the developer, to you.</span> <span data-start="121.22" data-end="123.65">So you have more control not only over the visuals</span> <span data-start="123.65" data-end="125.54">but to write better polyfills and have</span> <span data-start="125.54" data-end="130.97">more control over how your page just appears to the user.</span> <span data-start="130.97" data-end="133.039">It is hard because these four stages</span> <span data-start="133.039" data-end="134.33">are different in every browser.</span> <span data-start="134.33" data-end="136.82">Sometimes they're even parallel or not even</span> <span data-start="136.82" data-end="138.255">that clearly separated.</span> <span data-start="138.255" data-end="139.88">But we're working with all the browsers</span> <span data-start="139.88" data-end="144.17">to make sure everybody can implement these APIs.</span> <span data-start="144.17" data-end="147.32">Houdini can be super intimidating at first.</span> <span data-start="147.32" data-end="148.94">Because under the Houdini umbrella,</span> <span data-start="148.94" data-end="150.41">there's a lot of APIs.</span> <span data-start="150.41" data-end="153.47">And you don't really immediately know what to do with what.</span> <span data-start="153.47" data-end="156.53">But they actually kind of form a hierarchy.</span> <span data-start="156.53" data-end="161.6">So you have four high-level APIs, four major APIs</span> <span data-start="161.6" data-end="164.21">that basically represent those four major stages</span> <span data-start="164.21" data-end="165.56">of the rendering pipeline.</span> <span data-start="165.56" data-end="167.75">And then you have a couple of lower-level APIs that</span> <span data-start="167.75" data-end="170.3">build the underpinning, the basis for Houdini</span> <span data-start="170.3" data-end="172.1">and that make these higher-level APIs</span> <span data-start="172.1" data-end="173.72">possible in the first place.</span> <span data-start="173.72" data-end="176.97">And specifically, worklets are really interesting.</span> <span data-start="176.97" data-end="180.08">Worklets are kind of the Swiss Army knife</span> <span data-start="180.08" data-end="181.78">within Houdini for performance.</span> <span data-start="181.78" data-end="183.53">And so I want to make sure I take a second</span> <span data-start="183.53" data-end="185.09">to explain these because we're going to use them</span> <span data-start="185.09" data-end="186.35">for the rest of the talk.</span> <span data-start="186.35" data-end="190.252">And more importantly, I want to distinguish them from workers.</span> <span data-start="190.252" data-end="191.96">Because lots of people confuse these two,</span> <span data-start="191.96" data-end="194.28">and I can't blame them because they sound very similar.</span> <span data-start="194.28" data-end="197.46">And in fact, they actually have a lot of overlap.</span> <span data-start="197.46" data-end="199.805">But there is a couple of very important differences</span> <span data-start="199.805" data-end="200.93">that I want explain to you.</span> <span data-start="200.93" data-end="206.25">And for that, we have to talk about the event loop.</span> <span data-start="206.25" data-end="207.61">This is an event loop.</span> <span data-start="207.61" data-end="209.61">And if you don't know much about the event loop,</span> <span data-start="209.61" data-end="210.74">that's absolutely fine.</span> <span data-start="210.74" data-end="212.114">Everything that you need to know,</span> <span data-start="212.114" data-end="213.36">I will explain to you today.</span> <span data-start="213.36" data-end="214.943">But if you want to know more, I really</span> <span data-start="214.943" data-end="218.239">recommend watching Jake's talk about the event loop, which</span> <span data-start="218.239" data-end="220.28">you can probably find on YouTube if you just type</span> <span data-start="220.28" data-end="221.72">in his name and event loop.</span> <span data-start="221.72" data-end="226.17">And actually, I'm using a lot of his visuals in this talk.</span> <span data-start="226.17" data-end="228.17">So this is an event loop.</span> <span data-start="228.17" data-end="230.63">It's a loop, and it processes events.</span> <span data-start="230.63" data-end="233.51">And it's called an event loop.</span> <span data-start="233.51" data-end="235.52">Whenever an event happens, the JavaScript engine</span> <span data-start="235.52" data-end="239.18">checks if there's a handler for this event in your code base</span> <span data-start="239.18" data-end="242.48">and then takes the code for that handler and queues it up.</span> <span data-start="242.48" data-end="244.91">And every turn, the event loop takes something out</span> <span data-start="244.91" data-end="246.069">of the queue and runs it.</span> <span data-start="246.069" data-end="248.36">And then, in the next turn, it takes the next thing out</span> <span data-start="248.36" data-end="249.8">of the queue and runs it.</span> <span data-start="249.8" data-end="252.02">And that's obviously super simplified,</span> <span data-start="252.02" data-end="254.63">and there's much more nuance to this entire thing.</span> <span data-start="254.63" data-end="257.06">But that's kind of how an event loop works.</span> <span data-start="257.06" data-end="261.267">And in this world, a worker would look like this.</span> <span data-start="261.267" data-end="262.85">It's a completely separate event loop.</span> <span data-start="262.85" data-end="264.02">It's an isolated scope.</span> <span data-start="264.02" data-end="266.45">It has its own handlers, its own events.</span> <span data-start="266.45" data-end="269.31">And they have nothing to do with each other.</span> <span data-start="269.31" data-end="271.94">They might be able to put a task into the other loop's</span> <span data-start="271.94" data-end="276.03">queue with postMessage, but that's pretty much it.</span> <span data-start="276.03" data-end="279.59">And there is considerable cost to spinning up and maintaining</span> <span data-start="279.59" data-end="281.75">an event loop, and that's why you can't just</span> <span data-start="281.75" data-end="284.45">spin up 1,000 workers and call it a day.</span> <span data-start="284.45" data-end="287.09">Because that's actually quite costly.</span> <span data-start="287.09" data-end="289.18">Worklets are different.</span> <span data-start="289.18" data-end="293.45">They're also isolated JavaScript code with their own scope.</span> <span data-start="293.45" data-end="296.21">But worklets don't have an event loop.</span> <span data-start="296.21" data-end="300.59">Instead, they kind of attach to already existing event loops.</span> <span data-start="300.59" data-end="304.079">And that makes them a lot cheaper to create and maintain.</span> <span data-start="304.079" data-end="305.62">You can even attach multiple worklets</span> <span data-start="305.62" data-end="307.34">to an already existing event loop.</span> <span data-start="307.34" data-end="311.75">And because most worklets are specified to be stateless,</span> <span data-start="311.75" data-end="314.925">we can even migrate them in the middle of their lifetime.</span> <span data-start="314.925" data-end="316.55">So if it makes more sense for your code</span> <span data-start="316.55" data-end="318.174">to run in sync with another event loop,</span> <span data-start="318.174" data-end="321.35">we can just [POP] take it off and take it to the next event</span> <span data-start="321.35" data-end="323.76">loop where it makes more sense.</span> <span data-start="323.76" data-end="326.21">So this will come in really handy later on,</span> <span data-start="326.21" data-end="328.83">but that's basically the big difference between those two.</span> <span data-start="328.83" data-end="331.49">And now that we have worklets in our back pocket,</span> <span data-start="331.49" data-end="335.45">we can finally talk about the very first Houdini API,</span> <span data-start="335.45" data-end="338.24">which is for the paint worklet.</span> <span data-start="338.24" data-end="340.149">So as I said — </span> <span data-start="340.149" data-end="342.44">I'm not going to go through these in order, by the way,</span> <span data-start="342.44" data-end="344.106">more like in order of [? availability ?]</span> <span data-start="344.106" data-end="345.41">if that makes sense.</span> <span data-start="345.41" data-end="347.18">But for the paint worklets, the API</span> <span data-start="347.18" data-end="349.51">is called the CSS Paint API.</span> <span data-start="349.51" data-end="352.37">And as I said, all elements have to be painted sooner or later</span> <span data-start="352.37" data-end="354.81">to be able to appear onscreen.</span> <span data-start="354.81" data-end="357.08">And so far, you have been able to use</span> <span data-start="357.08" data-end="359.44">CSS to customize how your elements appear</span> <span data-start="359.44" data-end="364.43">onscreen but only with those ways that CSS exposes.</span> <span data-start="364.43" data-end="367.85">So for example, if you want to do rounded corners,</span> <span data-start="367.85" data-end="369.38">you can reduce border radius.</span> <span data-start="369.38" data-end="371.804">And you get this, and it's kind of great.</span> <span data-start="371.804" data-end="373.22">But it also turns out that there's</span> <span data-start="373.22" data-end="376.22">different ways to make a box seem</span> <span data-start="376.22" data-end="377.51">like it has rounded corners.</span> <span data-start="377.51" data-end="380.137">And if you want to use any of these other ways,</span> <span data-start="380.137" data-end="381.47">you're kind of screwed nowadays.</span> <span data-start="381.47" data-end="382.67">Because what do you do?</span> <span data-start="382.67" data-end="385.61">So for example, there is a so-called squircle, which</span> <span data-start="385.61" data-end="387.32">mathematically speaking, is closer</span> <span data-start="387.32" data-end="388.97">to a circle than a square.</span> <span data-start="388.97" data-end="391.71">And it doesn't change curvature abruptly at all.</span> <span data-start="391.71" data-end="393.71">So it has a kind of different aesthetic look,</span> <span data-start="393.71" data-end="395.9">which could be kind of nice.</span> <span data-start="395.9" data-end="399.056">So if you wanted to have this thing on the web today,</span> <span data-start="399.056" data-end="399.68">what do you do?</span> <span data-start="399.68" data-end="402.06">You can maybe do an SVG background image,</span> <span data-start="402.06" data-end="403.67">which is not really a border.</span> <span data-start="403.67" data-end="408.65">You could maybe use a canvas or a 9-slice image — </span> <span data-start="408.65" data-end="409.31">I don't know.</span> <span data-start="409.31" data-end="410.96">But with Houdini, you can actually</span> <span data-start="410.96" data-end="414.38">teach CSS how to draw the exact look that you</span> <span data-start="414.38" data-end="416.28">want to have on your page.</span> <span data-start="416.28" data-end="417.63">So how does this work?</span> <span data-start="417.63" data-end="420.17">Step one with all worklets is that you</span> <span data-start="420.17" data-end="423.86">have to load a JavaScript file into the worklet</span> <span data-start="423.86" data-end="425.64">that the browser gives to you.</span> <span data-start="425.64" data-end="427.809">So in this case, we have the CSS namespace,</span> <span data-start="427.809" data-end="430.1">and all the worklets that Houdini brings to the browser</span> <span data-start="430.1" data-end="433.009">are going to be in this CSS namespace sooner or later.</span> <span data-start="433.009" data-end="434.8">So in this case, it's called Paint Worklet.</span> <span data-start="434.8" data-end="436.79">And every worklet has an addModule call</span> <span data-start="436.79" data-end="438.29">with which you can load a JavaScript</span> <span data-start="438.29" data-end="439.97">file into that worklet.</span> <span data-start="439.97" data-end="443.26">Let's take a look inside this file.</span> <span data-start="443.26" data-end="445.96">In that file, we want to teach CSS</span> <span data-start="445.96" data-end="448.45">how to paint something new with JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="448.45" data-end="450.08">But first, it needs a name.</span> <span data-start="450.08" data-end="453.76">So there is a registerPaint function, and it takes a class.</span> <span data-start="453.76" data-end="455.8">And now, we want to basically associate</span> <span data-start="455.8" data-end="457.12">a name with that class.</span> <span data-start="457.12" data-end="458.5">And every paint class — </span> <span data-start="458.5" data-end="460.42">in this case, I'm using my-paint — </span> <span data-start="460.42" data-end="463">we need to define a paint call.</span> <span data-start="463" data-end="465.04">And this paint call gets a context,</span> <span data-start="465.04" data-end="467.71">which is almost identical to the canvas contact</span> <span data-start="467.71" data-end="469.48">that you're hopefully familiar with;</span> <span data-start="469.48" data-end="473.17">a geometry object, which tells you how much width and height</span> <span data-start="473.17" data-end="475.409">the element has that you're supposed to paint;</span> <span data-start="475.409" data-end="476.95">and a properties object, which allows</span> <span data-start="476.95" data-end="478.76">you to read the styles of the object</span> <span data-start="478.76" data-end="480.88">that you are painting —  so like, background color, text color,</span> <span data-start="480.88" data-end="481.45">font size.</span> <span data-start="481.45" data-end="484.392">All these things are in there for you to read.</span> <span data-start="484.392" data-end="486.1">And now, what I'm doing here is basically</span> <span data-start="486.1" data-end="487.96">I'm setting my fill style to hotpink.</span> <span data-start="487.96" data-end="489.85">And just draw the biggest possible circle</span> <span data-start="489.85" data-end="491.29">in the middle of the element — </span> <span data-start="491.29" data-end="493.87">not very useful, but in the way useful for me to show you</span> <span data-start="493.87" data-end="495.79">what is actually going on.</span> <span data-start="495.79" data-end="499.15">So now that we have defined how to draw this appearance,</span> <span data-start="499.15" data-end="500.98">how do we tell the browser to actually use</span> <span data-start="500.98" data-end="502.48">this new appearance?</span> <span data-start="502.48" data-end="503.65">So we do that in CSS.</span> <span data-start="503.65" data-end="505.54">So in this case, I'm just adding a new style.</span> <span data-start="505.54" data-end="507.49">And you can use paint worklets everywhere</span> <span data-start="507.49" data-end="509.39">that CSS expects an image.</span> <span data-start="509.39" data-end="512.32">So in this case, I'm setting the background image not to a URL</span> <span data-start="512.32" data-end="514.97">but to a paint and use the name that I</span> <span data-start="514.97" data-end="516.22">used in registerPaint in here.</span> <span data-start="516.22" data-end="519.76">So here, I use paint(my-paint).</span> <span data-start="519.76"

back to life.</span> <span data-start="546.12" data-end="548.162">I'm going to try something.</span> <span data-start="548.162" data-end="551.64">[LAUGHTER]</span> <span data-start="551.64" data-end="554.26">I achieved something today.</span> <span data-start="554.26" data-end="558.24">All right, as I was saying, we load the file.</span> <span data-start="558.24" data-end="559.2">We had that.</span> <span data-start="559.2" data-end="560.28">We had this one.</span> <span data-start="560.28" data-end="562.39">We draw a circle in the middle, and I</span> <span data-start="562.39" data-end="564.39">want to do the big reveal where we use the paint</span> <span data-start="564.39" data-end="565.765">function for the background image</span> <span data-start="565.765" data-end="568.38">instead of just a normal SVG image.</span> <span data-start="568.38" data-end="570.764">I'm going to press the button.</span> <span data-start="570.764" data-end="575.3">[APPLAUSE]</span> <span data-start="575.3" data-end="577.1">We have a pink circle.</span> <span data-start="577.1" data-end="578.09">I'm so happy.</span> <span data-start="578.09" data-end="579.815">By the way, everyone, thank you so much</span> <span data-start="579.815" data-end="582.065">for the kind messages on Twitter and your support here</span> <span data-start="582.065" data-end="582.44">in the room.</span> <span data-start="582.44" data-end="583.94">It could have been so much worse.</span> <span data-start="583.94" data-end="586.532">Thank you very much.</span> <span data-start="586.532" data-end="588.53">All right, what I'm doing here is, as I said,</span> <span data-start="588.53" data-end="590.46">I set the background image on a text area.</span> <span data-start="590.46" data-end="593.03">So this is a text area where I'm animating width and height.</span> <span data-start="593.03" data-end="594.196">Don't do this at home, kids.</span> <span data-start="594.196" data-end="595.97">Never animate width and height.</span> <span data-start="595.97" data-end="600.06">But you can see the circle is pink and in the middle.</span> <span data-start="600.06" data-end="602.7">So you might be asking, what is the advantage of using</span> <span data-start="602.7" data-end="605.75">Houdini's Paint API —  what this talk is about — </span> <span data-start="605.75" data-end="606.875">over using a normal canvas?</span> <span data-start="606.875" data-end="609">So there's a couple of things I want to talk about.</span> <span data-start="609" data-end="611.06">The first one is auto-repaint, meaning</span> <span data-start="611.06" data-end="613.25">that the browser can figure out when it actually</span> <span data-start="613.25" data-end="616.154">needs to run your code to do these painting operations.</span> <span data-start="616.154" data-end="618.32">I'm going to talk a bit about this more a little bit</span> <span data-start="618.32" data-end="620.18">later in the talk.</span> <span data-start="620.18" data-end="621.23">It is auto-sized.</span> <span data-start="621.23" data-end="623.24">If you've ever worked with the HTML canvas,</span> <span data-start="623.24" data-end="626.24">you know that the number of pixels on an HTML canvas</span> <span data-start="626.24" data-end="628.88">is completely independent from the number of pixels</span> <span data-start="628.88" data-end="630.95">a canvas has on the screen, which</span> <span data-start="630.95" data-end="632.201">is super painful to work with.</span> <span data-start="632.201" data-end="633.908">And in this case, you don't have to worry</span> <span data-start="633.908" data-end="635.54">about it because it is automatically</span> <span data-start="635.54" data-end="638.06">set to the correct size.</span> <span data-start="638.06" data-end="639.8">It is off main thread, meaning the code</span> <span data-start="639.8" data-end="642.14">that you write to do the paint operation doesn't</span> <span data-start="642.14" data-end="644.12">run on the main thread.</span> <span data-start="644.12" data-end="645.17">And that's a lie.</span> <span data-start="645.17" data-end="647.45">Currently in Chrome, we do run it on the main thread.</span> <span data-start="647.45" data-end="650.31">But as I said, the worklets can be migrated.</span> <span data-start="650.31" data-end="652.46">So the second we have the infrastructure in place</span> <span data-start="652.46" data-end="654.53">to run this kind of code somewhere else,</span> <span data-start="654.53" data-end="655.83">it will just happen.</span> <span data-start="655.83" data-end="659.63">And that means you don't use any of your main thread budget</span> <span data-start="659.63" data-end="663.32">making sure your page is buttery smooth.</span> <span data-start="663.32" data-end="666.5">No DOM overhead —  and this one is actually very underrated.</span> <span data-start="666.5" data-end="668.78">Often, I see effects on the web that</span> <span data-start="668.78" data-end="672.23">use a couple of DOM elements or any kind of assembly</span> <span data-start="672.23" data-end="675.2">of different styles to achieve a certain visual effect.</span> <span data-start="675.2" data-end="677.59">With this, you're just using a virtual canvas,</span> <span data-start="677.59" data-end="681.11">so not even one DOM element to achieve this effect.</span> <span data-start="681.11" data-end="683.51">And that can really add up on low-end phones.</span> <span data-start="683.51" data-end="685.43">So for example, this is one of the — </span> <span data-start="685.43" data-end="686.607">no.</span> <span data-start="686.607" data-end="689.81">[LAUGHTER]</span> <span data-start="689.81" data-end="692.3">No!</span> <span data-start="692.3" data-end="693.35">Wait.</span> <span data-start="693.35" data-end="697.62">For me, this just means I'm going to skip that slide.</span> <span data-start="697.62" data-end="702.22">So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go out of fullscreen,</span> <span data-start="702.22" data-end="706.32">and moving this to a different slide,</span> <span data-start="706.32" data-end="709.98">going back into fullscreen.</span> <span data-start="709.98" data-end="714.96">And we're going to go to this one.</span> <span data-start="714.96" data-end="716.18">All right.</span> <span data-start="716.18" data-end="719.575">[LAUGHTER]</span> <span data-start="719.575" data-end="726.86">[APPLAUSE]</span> <span data-start="726.86" data-end="728.33">Wow.</span> <span data-start="728.33" data-end="735.35">All right, my point that I was trying to make was that we</span> <span data-start="735.35" data-end="738.29">found that on low-end devices, implementing these kind</span> <span data-start="738.29" data-end="738.86">of effects — </span> <span data-start="738.86" data-end="741.65">like this wonderful effect that [? Una ?] implemented — </span> <span data-start="741.65" data-end="744.92">is actually more efficient in the paint worklet</span> <span data-start="744.92" data-end="747.251">than using a million DOM elements.</span> <span data-start="747.251" data-end="749.75">So that's why this is actually a performance [? formative ?]</span> <span data-start="749.75" data-end="751.5">to make your app run buttery smooth</span> <span data-start="751.5" data-end="753.2">even on the low-end devices.</span> <span data-start="753.2" data-end="755.116">So this is another effect that [? Una ?] wrote</span> <span data-start="755.116" data-end="756.65">that I think is really nice.</span> <span data-start="756.65" data-end="759.5">And this is kind of a nice example</span> <span data-start="759.5" data-end="763.58">to show how the browser can decide when to paint and when</span> <span data-start="763.58" data-end="764.2">not to paint.</span> <span data-start="764.2" data-end="767.75">So in the paint class, you can declare your dependencies.</span> <span data-start="767.75" data-end="771.5">You can say these are the CSS properties that I rely on.</span> <span data-start="771.5" data-end="773.18">And so the browser knows only when</span> <span data-start="773.18" data-end="776.46">any of these properties change will the code have to run.</span> <span data-start="776.46" data-end="778.05">Otherwise, it won't.</span> <span data-start="778.05" data-end="780.56">And so, in this case, you have a couple of custom properties</span> <span data-start="780.56" data-end="783.71">saying, I want to have this number of stars and this hue</span> <span data-start="783.71" data-end="786.59">and this different sizes kind of thing.</span> <span data-start="786.59" data-end="789.41">And then in CSS, I just do a keyframe animation on the hue,</span> <span data-start="789.41" data-end="791.48">and you end up with this effect.</span> <span data-start="791.48" data-end="794.42">And it's actually efficient in the sense it doesn't run just</span> <span data-start="794.42" data-end="796.4">[INAUDIBLE] every frame but only repaints when</span> <span data-start="796.4" data-end="798.957">the animation actually tells you that it's necessary.</span> <span data-start="801.7" data-end="803.79">This is another effect, a simple clock,</span> <span data-start="803.79" data-end="807.661">that many people might write with SVG or with a canvas.</span> <span data-start="807.661" data-end="809.91">Some people would, again, probably bend over backwards</span> <span data-start="809.91" data-end="812.85">and try to make this happen with a DOM and just a couple of DOM</span> <span data-start="812.85" data-end="813.58">elements.</span> <span data-start="813.58" data-end="816.038">But if you look closely, you can see that the hand actually</span> <span data-start="816.038" data-end="818.58">has a trail, and that suddenly makes it a lot harder</span> <span data-start="818.58" data-end="820.35">to do with SVG or with the DOM.</span> <span data-start="820.35" data-end="822.78">And maybe canvas would be more appropriate.</span> <span data-start="822.78" data-end="825.54">The nice thing here is that you can have this module, a clock</span> <span data-start="825.54" data-end="828.27">CSS Houdini module, and configure it</span> <span data-start="828.27" data-end="830.35">with just a couple of custom properties.</span> <span data-start="830.35" data-end="832.8">So you can animate the background color or the color</span> <span data-start="832.8" data-end="835.29">of the hands, the thickness of the hands,</span> <span data-start="835.29" data-end="838.17">the thickness of the circle at the end, or the length.</span> <span data-start="838.17" data-end="841.242">You can show or not show the individual stops on the clock.</span> <span data-start="841.242" data-end="842.95">You could do all of these things at once,</span> <span data-start="842.95" data-end="845.48">but it gets really stressful to look at.</span> <span data-start="845.48" data-end="847.23">So I wouldn't do that.</span> <span data-start="847.23" data-end="848.19">But it's just a clock.</span> <span data-start="848.19" data-end="851.35">And once again, this trail is just a CSS transition.</span> <span data-start="851.35" data-end="854.13">So the browser knows, while the transition is going on,</span> <span data-start="854.13" data-end="856.14">I need to repaint this every frame.</span> <span data-start="856.14" data-end="858.732">But the second the trail is done, it stops repainting.</span> <span data-start="858.732" data-end="860.19">It's a really easy performance win.</span> <span data-start="863.19" data-end="866.94">So far, we've been using CSS Paint for background images.</span> <span data-start="866.94" data-end="868.92">And we have gotten pretty far I think,</span> <span data-start="868.92" data-end="872.04">if you still remember what I was talking about a couple of hours</span> <span data-start="872.04" data-end="873.82">ago it feels like.</span> <span data-start="873.82" data-end="876.589">But you can use it anywhere where CSS expects an image.</span> <span data-start="876.589" data-end="878.13">So for example, you could also use it</span> <span data-start="878.13" data-end="880.272">for a mask image or a border image.</span> <span data-start="880.272" data-end="881.73">So in the land of border image, you</span> <span data-start="881.73" data-end="886.05">could make this kind of organic look, where the border looks</span> <span data-start="886.05" data-end="886.944">kind of hand-drawn.</span> <span data-start="886.944" data-end="888.36">And if you want that kind of look,</span> <span data-start="888.36" data-end="892.026">CSS Paint makes it really easy to achieve that effect.</span> <span data-start="892.026" data-end="893.4">This is probably a very important</span> <span data-start="893.4" data-end="895.23">progressive enhancement.</span> <span data-start="895.23" data-end="897.92">You can detect support for Paint Worklet in both JavaScript</span> <span data-start="897.92" data-end="899.34">and CSS.</span> <span data-start="899.34" data-end="902.76">One note about the at syntax for @supports,</span> <span data-start="902.76" data-end="904.92">it detects support for Paint Worklet,</span> <span data-start="904.92" data-end="907.24">not for one specific Paint Worklet.</span> <span data-start="907.24" data-end="909.6">So even if the name —  like in this case, something — </span> <span data-start="909.6" data-end="911.46">doesn't actually exist as a Paint Worklet,</span> <span data-start="911.46" data-end="915.09">it will still get evaluated, which is kind of handy.</span> <span data-start="915.09" data-end="916.98">For this talk, I want to introduce</span> <span data-start="916.98" data-end="919.26">the 3PigStability index, which is supposed</span> <span data-start="919.26" data-end="923.1">to be a little notion of how stable an API is,</span> <span data-start="923.1" data-end="924.78">based on the story of the three pigs</span> <span data-start="924.78" data-end="927.07">and the wolf who tries to blow their house down.</span> <span data-start="927.07" data-end="929.91">So in this case, in the CSS Paint API,</span> <span data-start="929.91" data-end="932.53">the spec is a [INAUDIBLE] recommendation,</span> <span data-start="932.53" data-end="936.23">which is basically W3C-speak for, it's stable.</span> <span data-start="936.23" data-end="938.13">It's shipped to stable in Chrome.</span> <span data-start="938.13" data-end="941.17">Safari announced that they have it in development right now.</span> <span data-start="941.17" data-end="944.454">And with that, I will call it brick stability.</span> <span data-start="944.454" data-end="945.87">That at the bottom, by the way, is</span> <span data-start="945.87" data-end="947.132">supposed to be a brick emoji.</span> <span data-start="947.132" data-end="948.84">But the brick emoji just got standardized</span> <span data-start="948.84" data-end="951.131">in June of this year, so none of the fonts have it yet.</span> <span data-start="951.131" data-end="955.17">But luckily, it still kind of looks like a brick.</span> <span data-start="955.17" data-end="957.06">If you want to know more about this API,</span> <span data-start="957.06" data-end="959.46">I'm going to shamelessly self-plug the article that I</span> <span data-start="959.46" data-end="962.21">wrote, which you can find here.</span> <span data-start="962.21" data-end="964.95">If you have any questions, hit me up any time.</span> <span data-start="964.95" data-end="967.44">And with that out the way, we finally</span> <span data-start="967.44" data-end="969.81">have talked about the first Houdini API.</span> <span data-start="969.81" data-end="971.37">I'm going to go onto the next one</span> <span data-start="971.37" data-end="973.26">and see if the browser will handle this.</span> <span data-start="973.26" data-end="975.68">I just realized I — </span> <span data-start="975.68" data-end="977.89">should I risk hiding the URL above?</span> <span data-start="977.89" data-end="980.97">I will do it, good.</span> <span data-start="980.97" data-end="982.695">The next one —  compositing.</span> <span data-start="982.695" data-end="984.45">As I said, the compositor main job</span> <span data-start="984.45" data-end="987.27">is to do animations with the papers that move around.</span> <span data-start="987.27" data-end="991.421">So as such, the animation is called the Animation Worklet</span> <span data-start="991.421" data-end="991.92">API.</span> <span data-start="991.92" data-end="993.575">So let's talk about that a bit.</span> <span data-start="993.575" data-end="995.7">If you currently think about animations on the web,</span> <span data-start="995.7" data-end="996.995">you have three choices.</span> <span data-start="996.995" data-end="998.37">It's more like 2 and 1/2 choices.</span> <span data-start="998.37" data-end="1000.039">You have CSS transitions, which allow</span> <span data-start="1000.039" data-end="1002.33">you to transition a CSS property from the current value</span> <span data-start="1002.33" data-end="1003.56">to a new value.</span> <span data-start="1003.56" data-end="1005.06">You have CSS keyframe animations,</span> <span data-start="1005.06" data-end="1010.19">which are a declarative timeline API, which is more powerful</span> <span data-start="1010.19" data-end="1012.17">and can do some kind of looping.</span> <span data-start="1012.17" data-end="1014.09">And you have Web Animations API, which</span> <span data-start="1014.09" data-end="1016.1">is the imperative version that allows</span> <span data-start="1016.1" data-end="1020.1">you to do nested timelines and all sorts of things.</span> <span data-start="1020.1" data-end="1022.4">But the problem is that it's really badly supported.</span> <span data-start="1022.4" data-end="1023.99">It's behind a flag in Safari.</span> <span data-start="1023.99" data-end="1027.109">Chrome has an implantation but it's missing a lot of features.</span> <span data-start="1027.109" data-end="1028.41">Edge doesn't have it at all.</span> <span data-start="1028.41" data-end="1031.73">So it really isn't usually a good choice.</span> <span data-start="1031.73" data-end="1033.56">But even if it was, there are often</span> <span data-start="1033.56" data-end="1036.589">scenarios where what Web Animations API offers</span> <span data-start="1036.589" data-end="1038.21">is not enough.</span> <span data-start="1038.21" data-end="1042.18">And this is where Animation Worklet API would come in.</span> <span data-start="1042.18" data-end="1045.95">So what you see here is a normal Web Animations API animation.</span> <span data-start="1048.71" data-end="1051.56">Usually Web Animations API is thought about in the .animate</span> <span data-start="1051.56" data-end="1052.28">call.</span> <span data-start="1052.28" data-end="1054.655">This is the same thing, just a little bit more elaborate.</span> <span data-start="1054.655" data-end="1056.03">It's also part of the API.</span> <span data-start="1056.03" data-end="1058.44">And a worklet animation is actually very, very similar.</span> <span data-start="1058.44" data-end="1061.1">So for example, I would just use a worklet animation</span> <span data-start="1061.1" data-end="1062.27">instead of an animation.</span> <span data-start="1062.27" data-end="1065.51">And because we are associating this animation with a worklet,</span> <span data-start="1065.51" data-end="1068.592">we need to, once again, provide a worklet name.</span> <span data-start="1068.592" data-end="1070.05">Other than that, it stays the same.</span> <span data-start="1070.05" data-end="1072.5">So we have the keyframe effect that we target an element with,</span> <span data-start="1072.5" data-end="1073.97">and we have two keyframes that we</span> <span data-start="1073.97" data-end="1077.35">want to use within two seconds.</span> <span data-start="1077.35" data-end="1080.14">Then now we have an animation worklet on this CSS namespace</span> <span data-start="1080.14" data-end="1081.61">and can call addModule.</span> <span data-start="1081.61" data-end="1085.915">And now, within our animation file, we can use JavaScripts.</span> <span data-start="1085.915" data-end="1087.29">We have an animate callback where</span> <span data-start="1087.29" data-end="1089.77">we get the current time and the effect of the animation.</span> <span data-start="1089.77" data-end="1092.87">And now it's our job to set the local time of the effect</span> <span data-start="1092.87" data-end="1094.862">depending on the current time.</span> <span data-start="1094.862" data-end="1097.07">If we do it like this, where we don't think about it,</span> <span data-start="1097.07" data-end="1098.32">it's literally a pass through.</span> <span data-start="1098.32" data-end="1101.92">And it will behave just like a normal web animation API.</span> <span data-start="1101.92" data-end="1104.11">But this is JavaScript, so you can basically</span> <span data-start="1104.11" data-end="1107.92">implement arbitrarily complex time mappings.</span> <span data-start="1107.92" data-end="1109.96">Now, what does this actually mean?</span> <span data-start="1109.96" data-end="1112.18">I'm not going to go into all the details of this API</span> <span data-start="1112.18" data-end="1114.18">but just going to give you a little taste of it.</span> <span data-start="1114.18" data-end="1115.27">So if you want to know more, I'm going</span> <span data-start="1115.27" data-end="1117.02">to shamelessly self-plug another article I</span> <span data-start="1117.02" data-end="1118.842">wrote, which you can find here.</span> <span data-start="1118.842" data-end="1120.55">And again, read it, and give me feedback.</span> <span data-start="1120.55" data-end="1122.89">I would very much welcome that.</span> <span data-start="1122.89" data-end="1125.02">But what do you use Animation Worklet for?</span> <span data-start="1125.02" data-end="1128.11">So for example, I think a year ago or two years ago,</span> <span data-start="1128.11" data-end="1131.799">Safari proposed the spring timing function.</span> <span data-start="1131.799" data-end="1133.09">And it's implemented in Safari.</span> <span data-start="1133.09" data-end="1137.08">I don't think any other browser has implemented it so far.</span> <span data-start="1137.08" data-end="1139.07">But what do you do if you want to use it?</span> <span data-start="1139.07" data-end="1141.57">Or what do you do if you have any other timing function that</span> <span data-start="1141.57" data-end="1143.174">doesn't exist and you want to use it?</span> <span data-start="1143.174" data-end="1145.34">This is where Animation Worklet would come in handy.</span> <span data-start="1145.34" data-end="1146.881">So in this case, we can, for example,</span> <span data-start="1146.881" data-end="1148.06">write a bounce animator.</span> <span data-start="1148.06" data-end="1150.393">Because if you think about it, if you animate an element</span> <span data-start="1150.393" data-end="1153.28">from A to B, you can either just move it from A to B,</span> <span data-start="1153.28" data-end="1155.79">but you could also move it from A to B and a little bit back</span> <span data-start="1155.79" data-end="1156.94">and a little less back, and it will</span> <span data-start="1156.94" data-end="1158.35">look kind of like a bounce.</span> <span data-start="1158.35" data-end="1160.274">And that's exactly what we're going to do.</span> <span data-start="1160.274" data-end="1162.44">So we have a constructor where we take some options.</span> <span data-start="1162.44" data-end="1163.33">In this case, there's going to be</span> <span data-start="1163.33" data-end="1165.746">an option, for example, for bounciness, which makes sense.</span> <span data-start="1165.746" data-end="1167.255">How bouncy is it supposed to look?</span> <span data-start="1167.255" data-end="1168.796">And in the animate call, we are going</span> <span data-start="1168.796" data-end="1170.639">to use this bounce function.</span> <span data-start="1170.639" data-end="1172.68">Depending on the bounciness and the current time,</span> <span data-start="1172.68" data-end="1175.221">we're going to determine where in between these two keyframes</span> <span data-start="1175.221" data-end="1177.28">we want to end up.</span> <span data-start="1177.28" data-end="1179.95">So the bounce function I use, I implemented with some really</span> <span data-start="1179.95" data-end="1181.339">dodgy and handwavy physics.</span> <span data-start="1181.339" data-end="1183.13">But in the end, you can just think about it</span> <span data-start="1183.13" data-end="1186.76">like implementing this kind of graph between two keyframes.</span> <span data-start="1186.76" data-end="1188.6">So if we do that, and we run that,</span> <span data-start="1188.6" data-end="1190.6">you can see that it's now actually a bounce.</span> <span data-start="1190.6" data-end="1193.51">And keep in mind that this is literally just two keyframes,</span> <span data-start="1193.51" data-end="1196.85">and we're just bending time, so to speak.</span> <span data-start="1196.85" data-end="1199.069">And this animation, because it's a worklet,</span> <span data-start="1199.069" data-end="1200.11">runs off the main thread.</span> <span data-start="1200.11" data-end="1202.06">It actually runs on the compositor thread.</span> <span data-start="1202.06" data-end="1204.82">Meaning that even if the main thread is super busy,</span> <span data-start="1204.82" data-end="1207.04">it will make sure that this animation runs exactly</span> <span data-start="1207.04" data-end="1209.83">at the device's frame rate, frame perfect, and make sure</span> <span data-start="1209.83" data-end="1214.22">that your animations look really, really smooth.</span> <span data-start="1214.22" data-end="1216.78">So so far, we have done this.</span> <span data-start="1216.78" data-end="1218.1">We have done animation.</span> <span data-start="1218.1" data-end="1219.807">But if you look at this, I explicitly</span> <span data-start="1219.807" data-end="1221.64">wrote out document timeline even though it's</span> <span data-start="1221.64" data-end="1224.402">an optional argument.</span> <span data-start="1224.402" data-end="1226.11">The point is that with Animation Worklet,</span> <span data-start="1226.11" data-end="1228.78">you could get time from somewhere else, not just</span> <span data-start="1228.78" data-end="1230.091">actual time.</span> <span data-start="1230.091" data-end="1231.84">You could, for example, think of something</span> <span data-start="1231.84" data-end="1233.676">like a scroll timeline.</span> <span data-start="1233.676" data-end="1235.3">Or you could even conceive of something</span> <span data-start="1235.3" data-end="1236.6">like an input timeline.</span> <span data-start="1236.6" data-end="1238.1">We are talking about input timeline,</span> <span data-start="1238.1" data-end="1239.49">but I have nothing to show here.</span> <span data-start="1239.49" data-end="1243.19">But I can show you scroll timeline.</span> <span data-start="1243.19" data-end="1245.73">So here, you see a Pac-Man that I've linked</span> <span data-start="1245.73" data-end="1247.6">to a scroller at the bottom.</span> <span data-start="1247.6" data-end="1250.2">So what you see, I can basically scroll the scroller</span> <span data-start="1250.2" data-end="1252.9">at the bottom, and the animation will jump to the position</span> <span data-start="1252.9" data-end="1255.11">where I am within the scroller.</span> <span data-start="1255.11" data-end="1256.6">And so it kind of gives this — </span> <span data-start="1256.6" data-end="1258.87">this gives you an animation scrubber.</span> <span data-start="1258.87" data-end="1261.21">And this is kind of fun but not that useful.</span> <span data-start="1261.21" data-end="1264.39">But you can conceive of more useful uses [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span data-start="1264.39" data-end="1266.4">scroll-linked effects, where I have</span> <span data-start="1266.4" data-end="1267.57">three independent animation.</span> <span data-start="1267.57" data-end="1269.7">The follow button, my name, and my avatar</span> <span data-start="1269.7" data-end="1271.44">are all scroll-linked effects that</span> <span data-start="1271.44" data-end="1274.02">can assume their position within the animation</span> <span data-start="1274.02" data-end="1275.85">depending on how far I scroll.</span> <span data-start="1275.85" data-end="1278.37">The parallax effect would be another very popular choice</span> <span data-start="1278.37" data-end="1279.48">to use with this.</span> <span data-start="1279.48" data-end="1282.03">And it's much easier to implement than it currently</span> <span data-start="1282.03" data-end="1284.28">is on the web.</span> <span data-start="1284.28" data-end="1289.02">Now, in combination with CSS Scroll Snap Points that we just</span> <span data-start="1289.02" data-end="1291.884">implemented in Chrome, you can now have a lot of synergy here,</span> <span data-start="1291.884" data-end="1293.55">where you have really smooth transitions</span> <span data-start="1293.55" data-end="1295.65">between different sections of your app.</span> <span data-start="1295.65" data-end="1297.36">And you see I have an indicator on top,</span> <span data-start="1297.36" data-end="1301.05">and the images kind of zoom into view.</span> <span data-start="1301.05" data-end="1303.18">And now, for me, the really interesting thing</span> <span data-start="1303.18" data-end="1307.14">is that Animation Worklet is the same thing as the Paint Worklet</span> <span data-start="1307.14" data-end="1308.37">was for rounded corners.</span> <span data-start="1308.37" data-end="1311.16">If you don't like how Scroll Snap Points work,</span> <span data-start="1311.16" data-end="1312.93">Animation Worklet is low-level enough</span> <span data-start="1312.93" data-end="1316.21">to allow you to implement your own version.</span> <span data-start="1316.21" data-end="1317.79">So it really future-proofs the web</span> <span data-start="1317.79" data-end="1322.064">for whatever people will come up with in the future.</span> <span data-start="1322.064" data-end="1323.73">Let's talk about the 3PigStability index</span> <span data-start="1323.73" data-end="1326.07">for this API, which — </span> <span data-start="1326.07" data-end="1329.01">we have gone through many, many iterations on Animation</span> <span data-start="1329.01" data-end="1331.62">Worklet, but always in collaboration with Apple,</span> <span data-start="1331.62" data-end="1333.66">with Microsoft, and with Mozilla.</span> <span data-start="1333.66" data-end="1336.51">And we are now at a point we feel fairly confident that all</span> <span data-start="1336.51" data-end="1339.51">the browsers are at least on-board on a conceptual level</span> <span data-start="1339.51" data-end="1340.65">with what we come up with.</span> <span data-start="1340.65" data-end="1344.4">So all in all, I would give this a wood stability.</span> <span data-start="1344.4" data-end="1346.45">As I said, we feel pretty confident about it.</span> <span data-start="1346.45" data-end="1349.89">But now it's really time for us to see what you feel about it.</span> <span data-start="1349.89" data-end="1351.15">So it is in Canary.</span> <span data-start="1351.15" data-end="1352.69">You can play with it now.</span> <span data-start="1352.69" data-end="1355.44">And we are going to an origin trial in Chrome 71.</span> <span data-start="1355.44" data-end="1357.21">So if you want to test out in production — </span> <span data-start="1357.21" data-end="1358.8">and we would love it if you do — </span> <span data-start="1358.8" data-end="1360.47">please sign up here.</span> <span data-start="1360.47" data-end="1362.72">As I said, the article should give you all the insight</span> <span data-start="1362.72" data-end="1363.82">that you need to get started.</span> <span data-start="1363.82" data-end="1364.95">And if not, please contact me.</span> <span data-start="1364.95" data-end="1366.491">I'm very eager to help out so that we</span> <span data-start="1366.491" data-end="1370.27">can get some real data on the benefits of Animation Worklet.</span> <span data-start="1370.27" data-end="1373.11">I have —  I don't know how much time I have left at this point.</span> <span data-start="1373.11" data-end="1374.28">I'm just going to go for it.</span> <span data-start="1374.28" data-end="1377.28">Because I can talk a little bit about Layout API.</span> <span data-start="1377.28" data-end="1380.46">So the Layout API, I'm going to start</span> <span data-start="1380.46" data-end="1383.4">with the 3PigStability index because it's complete straw.</span> <span data-start="1383.4" data-end="1386.52">We literally refactored this API two weeks ago at [? TPACK. ?]</span> <span data-start="1386.52" data-end="1390.844">So there is a half-finished implementation in Canary,</span> <span data-start="1390.844" data-end="1392.01">and you should play with it.</span> <span data-start="1392.01" data-end="1395.514">But don't expect the code to still run next week.</span> <span data-start="1395.514" data-end="1397.68">But there is so much potential in this [INAUDIBLE]..</span> <span data-start="1397.68" data-end="1400.56">I really want to give you a little insight into this.</span> <span data-start="1400.56" data-end="1403.65">So with the custom layout API or the Layout Worklet,</span> <span data-start="1403.65" data-end="1407.349">you can basically define your own display values.</span> <span data-start="1407.349" data-end="1409.89">So I'm just going to have a main element and a couple of divs</span> <span data-start="1409.89" data-end="1410.889">in there, and that's it.</span> <span data-start="1410.889" data-end="1414.912">Everything —  all the other magic will happen in the worklet.</span> <span data-start="1414.912" data-end="1417.12">So now we have a layout worklet on the CSS namespace.</span> <span data-start="1417.12" data-end="1418.8">I'm going to add the module.</span> <span data-start="1418.8" data-end="1420.96">And in there, we have a layout callback.</span> <span data-start="1420.96" data-end="1423.62">I'm not going to explain all the parameters because A,</span> <span data-start="1423.62" data-end="1425.2">I don't understand them all.</span> <span data-start="1425.2" data-end="1428.329">And B, layout is pretty complex.</span> <span data-start="1428.329" data-end="1429.87">But I'm going to keep this one simple</span> <span data-start="1429.87" data-end="1430.96">so we can get a feel for it.</span> <span data-start="1430.96" data-end="1432.6">So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to loop over</span> <span data-start="1432.6" data-end="1434.7">all the children, all my child nodes</span> <span data-start="1434.7" data-end="1438.81">that are on my custom layout element.</span> <span data-start="1438.81" data-end="1442.14">I'm going to lay them out in empty space, basically asking,</span> <span data-start="1442.14" data-end="1445.152">how big would you be if you had no constraints?</span> <span data-start="1445.152" data-end="1447.36">And then I'm just going to give them a random offset,</span> <span data-start="1447.36" data-end="1449.61">basically giving them a random position</span> <span data-start="1449.61" data-end="1451.877">within the rectangle that I occupy.</span> <span data-start="1451.877" data-end="1453.96">And then I return this list to the browser saying,</span> <span data-start="1453.96" data-end="1455.05">I did my layout.</span> <span data-start="1455.05" data-end="1457.037">Now, please go forth and paint me.</span> <span data-start="1457.037" data-end="1458.87">And that's exactly what the browser will do.</span> <span data-start="1458.87" data-end="1461.4">So if you look at this, you can see a couple of rectangles.</span> <span data-start="1461.4" data-end="1464.82">And every couple seconds, I add or remove a rectangle</span> <span data-start="1464.82" data-end="1466.26">to force a relayout.</span> <span data-start="1466.26" data-end="1468.22">And they get a truly random position,</span> <span data-start="1468.22" data-end="1470.07">which is also truly useless.</span> <span data-start="1470.07" data-end="1473.04">But you can see that this is actual the layout</span> <span data-start="1473.04" data-end="1473.93">phase of the browser.</span> <span data-start="1473.93" data-end="1475.26">This runs during the layout phase</span> <span data-start="1475.26" data-end="1476.676">of the browser, something that was</span> <span data-start="1476.676" data-end="1479.087">completely closed-off to developers so far.</span> <span data-start="1479.087" data-end="1481.17">And to give a little bit more of a useful example,</span> <span data-start="1481.17" data-end="1483.39">I also implemented a masonry layout.</span> <span data-start="1483.39" data-end="1485.19">So here, I'm just loading random images</span> <span data-start="1485.19" data-end="1487.86">from Unsplash with different aspect ratios.</span> <span data-start="1487.86" data-end="1491.01">And the masonry algorithm, if you will,</span> <span data-start="1491.01" data-end="1493.56">takes care of assembling these in three columns.</span> <span data-start="1493.56" data-end="1495.84">And the number of columns is, once again,</span> <span data-start="1495.84" data-end="1498.512">just a custom properties, which I can increase.</span> <span data-start="1498.512" data-end="1500.22">And it will kind of scale up and give you</span> <span data-start="1500.22" data-end="1504.51">this really nice masonry look, which so far, you would always</span> <span data-start="1504.51" data-end="1507.99">have to do with position absolute magic and main thread</span> <span data-start="1507.99" data-end="1508.65">JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="1508.65" data-end="1510.466">And this is just actual layout, which</span> <span data-start="1510.466" data-end="1511.59">I think is really exciting.</span> <span data-start="1514.7" data-end="1516.11">If you're into the code — </span> <span data-start="1516.11" data-end="1518.9">because I don't have an article for Layout Worklet yet,</span> <span data-start="1518.9" data-end="1521.675">mostly because
