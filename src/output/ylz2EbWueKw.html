<section><span data-start="6552"><span class="speaker">Chris Wilson</span>: So I am Chris Wilson.</span> <span data-start="8010">I'm here with my colleague, John Pallett,</span> <span data-start="9718">who will be out in a minute.</span> <span data-start="11170">And we're here to talk about the next great platform,</span> <span data-start="13980">the Immersive Web.</span> <span data-start="16079">And this is actually not running off my laptop,</span> <span data-start="18450">so hopefully I won't have any problems.</span> <span data-start="20160">At least they won't be mine.</span> <span data-start="22700">Now we talk about this word immersive a lot,</span> <span data-start="27450">and I want to define what I meant by the immersive web.</span> <span data-start="30840">And at this point, I think pretty much everyone has heard</span> <span data-start="33360">of virtual reality at least.</span> <span data-start="35100">Hands up, who saw "Ready Player One "?</span> <span data-start="37892">That's actually a really small percentage.</span> <span data-start="39706">You should go see it.</span> <span data-start="40580">It's a good movie.</span> <span data-start="41329">It's good entertainment.</span> <span data-start="42350">So it's totally just like that.</span> <span data-start="44390">Well, not really, but virtual reality</span> <span data-start="46520">is all about immersing yourself in a completely alternate</span> <span data-start="49490">reality, putting what I refer to as the reality blinders on,</span> <span data-start="53210">completely replacing everything you can see and usually here,</span> <span data-start="57680">and immersing yourself in this totally different world.</span> <span data-start="60980">That world may be a game.</span> <span data-start="62700">It can be like visualizing a data set.</span> <span data-start="66030">It can be a virtual workspace.</span> <span data-start="68120">My kids like to play this game where I put on a VR headset</span> <span data-start="71695">and they see how close to me they</span> <span data-start="73070">can dance before I notice that they're there, which usually</span> <span data-start="76550">it's pretty close.</span> <span data-start="77609">But certainly, when I'm at my desk at work,</span> <span data-start="79400">this is my favorite place to go into VR, because it</span> <span data-start="82310">masks everything off around me.</span> <span data-start="84170">The sea of cubicles isn't there anymore.</span> <span data-start="87590">And you usually experience virtual reality</span> <span data-start="90440">through a tethered VR headset, like a Vive or Rift,</span> <span data-start="94370">standalone devices like the Oculus Go,</span> <span data-start="97070">or smartphone VR systems, like Daydream View, Gear VR,</span> <span data-start="101480">or Google Cardboard, my personal favorite.</span> <span data-start="103940">And any of these devices end up using a combination</span> <span data-start="106490">of head tracking, screen display, optics,</span> <span data-start="109700">and controllers to make you feel like you're</span> <span data-start="112220">present in a totally different world.</span> <span data-start="114740">Now, at Google, we've been working</span> <span data-start="116390">on exposing this to the web for really quite a long time on all</span> <span data-start="121580">these devices, from high end desktop headsets</span> <span data-start="124820">on Windows to a polyfill that supports WebVR</span> <span data-start="128449">on any smartphone in Cardboard.</span> <span data-start="131000">Yes, even Safari on iPhones.</span> <span data-start="134210">And, in fact, you may not even have a VR headset.</span> <span data-start="136730">You might not even have this $0.29 worth of cardboard.</span> <span data-start="141150">WebXR and the XR polyfill can actually view VR worlds just</span> <span data-start="145550">on a mobile device using the accelerometer and orientation</span> <span data-start="149060">API.</span> <span data-start="149960">So you can look around a 3D scene.</span> <span data-start="152150">And this lets the users look around your 3D world</span> <span data-start="154670">even if they don't want to drop their phone into a headset.</span> <span data-start="159610">Now, in addition to bringing VR to the web, we also — </span> <span data-start="164430">my team actually works on bringing the web into VR,</span> <span data-start="167640">at least on Daydream devices.</span> <span data-start="169290">Starting with Chrome 67, you can actually</span> <span data-start="171720">launch a VR version of Chrome inside the Daydream home</span> <span data-start="175500">screen, and we put a lot of work into making</span> <span data-start="177720">browsing the traditional 2D web a really great experience.</span> <span data-start="182110">But, of course, the really cool part is when the browser in VR</span> <span data-start="187050">can be used to browse immersive worlds.</span> <span data-start="189510">You can hop back and forth between the 2D web and VR</span> <span data-start="192840">content that's hosted directly on the web.</span> <span data-start="196900">So this gives you a really great easy experience</span> <span data-start="200310">and really, actually, totally immersive.</span> <span data-start="202470">It's like you're just navigating inside that world.</span> <span data-start="207420">Now, having a browser inside the VR world is so useful.</span> <span data-start="212220">It turns out 83% of Daydream users</span> <span data-start="215430">also regularly use the browser in VR.</span> <span data-start="218310">This was something we added on after the fact.</span> <span data-start="220620">Daydream shipped without a browser.</span> <span data-start="222970">And now this is a regular occurrence for most of them.</span> <span data-start="226650">It shows how important the content from the web</span> <span data-start="228960">is, even when you're just living inside a VR world.</span> <span data-start="233864">But enough about virtual reality for a second.</span> <span data-start="235780">I want to talk about when you don't want those reality</span> <span data-start="239560">blinders on.</span> <span data-start="240432">I actually like to interact with my kids.</span> <span data-start="242140">I want to be able to see them and not</span> <span data-start="243681">have them dance in front of me.</span> <span data-start="245410">And the most exciting extension of the computing platform,</span> <span data-start="248530">to me, is the concept of augmented reality,</span> <span data-start="251770">not just overlaying AR stickers and animated characters</span> <span data-start="256269">or being able to drop virtual objects into your reality.</span> <span data-start="259700">The key to understanding AR's potential</span> <span data-start="262029">is that it's really about the concept of your computer</span> <span data-start="265720">getting to see, getting to see a world around you,</span> <span data-start="268840">interpret parts of it, find surfaces, in the future,</span> <span data-start="271960">recognize objects, and then augment</span> <span data-start="274600">that reality with virtual bits of user experience.</span> <span data-start="278650">Instead of trying to totally replace your reality,</span> <span data-start="281470">we really want computers to just convincingly blend</span> <span data-start="284500">virtual and real experiences.</span> <span data-start="288640">Now, for AR, there are some headsets,</span> <span data-start="290350">like the Hololens, the Magic Leap One.</span> <span data-start="292700">There are projection systems to display on real-world surfaces.</span> <span data-start="299140">But most users will probably first experience AR</span> <span data-start="301990">like I did, using a camera passthrough</span> <span data-start="304060">experience on a mobile device showing things</span> <span data-start="306370">like AR stickers.</span> <span data-start="309010">And the cool thing is, if you think of the things</span> <span data-start="311260">the web is really, really good at, the long tail of software,</span> <span data-start="316210">content, products you expect from the web, the experiences</span> <span data-start="320320">that users will probably happily click</span> <span data-start="323440">on but they wouldn't necessarily install</span> <span data-start="325750">on their devices, the massive success of the web</span> <span data-start="328480">as a commerce platform is a huge, huge benefit.</span> <span data-start="332110">You can start to see how enabling developers</span> <span data-start="334690">to build immersive experiences that</span> <span data-start="336400">are delivered in this really ephemeral fashion</span> <span data-start="339280">is a fantastic idea.</span> <span data-start="341960">You don't have to install an app to see how that couch is going</span> <span data-start="344620">to look in your living room.</span> <span data-start="345820">You don't have to install an app to view an immersive video</span> <span data-start="349090">trailer.</span> <span data-start="350330">The ephemerality of the web makes the ability</span> <span data-start="352630">to do these immersive experiences a fantastic match.</span> <span data-start="355980">And our mission, John's and mine,</span> <span data-start="358000">is really to enable web developers to break that plane,</span> <span data-start="361180">break out of the flat design world</span> <span data-start="363430">that we've been living in for so long</span> <span data-start="365140">to enable these truly immersive experiences.</span> <span data-start="369420">And to enable that, we really needed</span> <span data-start="371370">to start with the baseline, being</span> <span data-start="374140">able to connect immersive displays and render to them.</span> <span data-start="378100">And that's where the WebXR device API comes in.</span> <span data-start="381520">This replaces the old WebVR API.</span> <span data-start="384160">It evolves those concepts to expose not just VR but also AR</span> <span data-start="388840">functionality, and in true, extensible web platform</span> <span data-start="392200">layering.</span> <span data-start="392960">This is really the underpinning only.</span> <span data-start="395020">This lets us connect to those devices, render displays,</span> <span data-start="398650">understand which way they're pointed,</span> <span data-start="401620">interact with controllers, that kind of stuff.</span> <span data-start="404390">And this is a really broad multi-year effort</span> <span data-start="408550">by a bunch of different companies.</span> <span data-start="410500">Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, Samsung, Amazon, Oculus,</span> <span data-start="414430">a whole bunch of others as well have been</span> <span data-start="416320">working on this for a while.</span> <span data-start="419800">And this has all been developed, by the way, in the W3C.</span> <span data-start="423280">In fact, we have a brand new immersive web working group.</span> <span data-start="426520">I personally co-chair this with my colleague, Ada Rose Cannon,</span> <span data-start="429790">who's sitting right down here in the front — </span> <span data-start="432430">I just had to make her blush — </span> <span data-start="434830">from Samsung.</span> <span data-start="435830">And we're tasked with taking this spec</span> <span data-start="438520">to an actual final status.</span> <span data-start="440530">And this is why we created a working group,</span> <span data-start="442960">because we feel it's super important to actually land this</span> <span data-start="445840">now and not just keep talking about how</span> <span data-start="448210">cool it could be in the future.</span> <span data-start="450340">This really shows the maturing of this API,</span> <span data-start="453130">because it's moving closer and closer</span> <span data-start="455050">to becoming a final standard.</span> <span data-start="456730">And, of course, we also continue to incubate new ideas</span> <span data-start="459760">in the immersive web with the community group.</span> <span data-start="463460">Now, if you want to experiment with WebXR API today,</span> <span data-start="466720">you can enable it with Chrome's flags, with the about flags.</span> <span data-start="470350">If you want to try out AR scenarios,</span> <span data-start="472210">you have to enable this second flag.</span> <span data-start="473965">That should be going away soon, because we've</span> <span data-start="475840">done some new mode work in the spec to make that work, too.</span> <span data-start="479230">We have a currently running origin trial, too,</span> <span data-start="482230">if you want to try to deploy this out to normal users,</span> <span data-start="486070">and, of course, if you're willing to accept</span> <span data-start="488920">the responsibility of making changes</span> <span data-start="491200">as the spec and our implementation change.</span> <span data-start="495520">Now, finally, I've mentioned the WebXR polyfill</span> <span data-start="498070">a couple of times.</span> <span data-start="498820">And this is something I wanted to give</span> <span data-start="500403">a little more detail about.</span> <span data-start="501580">This is a polyfill JavaScript library</span> <span data-start="503650">that's maintained by the community group.</span> <span data-start="506740">It helps developers in a couple of different ways.</span> <span data-start="509090">First, it offers a JavaScript-only implementation</span> <span data-start="513039">that works for VR scenarios in any mobile browser using</span> <span data-start="517390">orientation events.</span> <span data-start="518830">So even mobile Safari, with cardboard devices</span> <span data-start="522130">or flat displays, you can actually</span> <span data-start="524200">get a WebXR implementation just through JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="528610">Secondly, if a browser does implement the older WebVR</span> <span data-start="531760">API, like Firefox did this and Microsoft Edge did this,</span> <span data-start="537340">it can actually build XR on top of that.</span> <span data-start="540640">And you get the hardware speed of their former WebVR</span> <span data-start="544720">implementation.</span> <span data-start="545920">So you can instantly make your WebXR content</span> <span data-start="548020">accessible to a much wider range of users with just one script.</span> <span data-start="553360">Now, with that, I want to bring out my colleague, John,</span> <span data-start="557030">who's going to drill down into the augmented reality</span> <span data-start="559510">possibilities in a bit more detail.</span> <span data-start="561940">Thanks, John.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="562620"><span class="speaker">John Pallett</span>: Thanks, Chris.</span> <span data-start="569050">So let's talk a little bit more about augmented reality or AR.</span> <span data-start="572880">As Chris mentioned, augmented reality</span> <span data-start="574800">is largely about being able to overlay information</span> <span data-start="577350">over top of the real world.</span> <span data-start="578820">And if you've tried out AR stickers,</span> <span data-start="580320">or if you put masks on your face on a smartphone,</span> <span data-start="582570">you've already seen augmented reality.</span> <span data-start="584839">And the reason for this is that there</span> <span data-start="586380">are hundreds of millions of phones and tablets</span> <span data-start="588960">out there right now that support augmented reality,</span> <span data-start="591990">and the number is growing.</span> <span data-start="593590">And most of those devices have web browsers,</span> <span data-start="595810">which means there is a big opportunity for web developers</span> <span data-start="598230">here.</span> <span data-start="598860">And the lowest hanging fruit, really,</span> <span data-start="600690">is the ability to add a new experience to an existing 2D</span> <span data-start="604710">web page.</span> <span data-start="605520">So it doesn't require an entirely new site.</span> <span data-start="607500">You can add AR capability to an existing 2D website.</span> <span data-start="611694">There've been a number of partners</span> <span data-start="613110">that have been experimenting with this using the WebXR</span> <span data-start="615390">device API and turning on the hit test flag</span> <span data-start="618090">that Chris mentioned.</span> <span data-start="619500">They're doing this in Chrome Dev and in Canary.</span> <span data-start="622020">And as one example, Plattar, which is an augmented reality</span> <span data-start="625110">platform that lets businesses put</span> <span data-start="627180">virtual objects in the real world,</span> <span data-start="629369">they've done a couple of demos.</span> <span data-start="630660">And there's some interesting ideas here.</span> <span data-start="632880">On the left, you can see that users can learn about a product</span> <span data-start="638070">by getting information in context on the product itself</span> <span data-start="642090">rather than having to go through data sheets.</span> <span data-start="644190">And it actually saves shipping demo units</span> <span data-start="646080">to businesses that are thinking about buying</span> <span data-start="647970">machinery or heavy equipment.</span> <span data-start="649980">On the right, you can see that looking</span> <span data-start="651714">at objects from different angles has a lot of value,</span> <span data-start="653880">in this case, for fashion, and generally,</span> <span data-start="656460">for shopping, but also for education where students</span> <span data-start="659580">can explore the object or artifact</span> <span data-start="661800">that they're learning about.</span> <span data-start="663600">Now, this doesn't all have to be in augmented reality.</span> <span data-start="666180">You could do both of these using a 3D model on your website.</span> <span data-start="669180">But if you can put it into the real world,</span> <span data-start="671100">you get a better sense of context as well as scale.</span> <span data-start="675822">Now, what's interesting, though, is</span> <span data-start="677280">that, from a user experience perspective,</span> <span data-start="680569">there are a lot of interesting things</span> <span data-start="682110">to learn about augmented reality,</span> <span data-start="684670">particularly how it fits on the web.</span> <span data-start="686622">And it's a good reason to start experimenting with it</span> <span data-start="688830">now if you're thinking about adding it.</span> <span data-start="690990">So by way of example, West Elm, who</span> <span data-start="694140">sells home decor and furniture, did some in-store testing.</span> <span data-start="697560">And what they did was they went to one of their stores</span> <span data-start="700350">and they picked four shoppers at random.</span> <span data-start="702540">And they showed them a prototype shopping website that</span> <span data-start="705690">incorporated augmented reality.</span> <span data-start="707610">Now this isn't a huge study.</span> <span data-start="708870">It's four shoppers.</span> <span data-start="709676">But they had some interesting findings.</span> <span data-start="711300">And they gave us permission to share them.</span> <span data-start="713760">So the first thing that they learned</span> <span data-start="715260">is with these customers, the terms AR or augmented reality,</span> <span data-start="719140">it's not really a common vocabulary.</span> <span data-start="721290">Basic terminology, like view in your room,</span> <span data-start="723960">is a better way of telling users what to do.</span> <span data-start="726390">But even then, without a visual showing what's going to happen,</span> <span data-start="729540">that text can really get lost with everything else that</span> <span data-start="732100">is visual on the site.</span> <span data-start="733830">So what they're looking at now is</span> <span data-start="735300">ways to add both an icon and text so that the user has</span> <span data-start="738222">a call to action.</span> <span data-start="738930">They know what to do.</span> <span data-start="740400">One approach might be to have a rotating 3D</span> <span data-start="742224">model so that the user understands, hey,</span> <span data-start="743890">this is more than just another image on the page.</span> <span data-start="747070">The next thing they learned is that users get confused</span> <span data-start="749320">without clear directions.</span> <span data-start="750430">You can see here that there's a delay while the user is trying</span> <span data-start="753820">to figure out what to do.</span> <span data-start="755600">Do I tap?</span> <span data-start="756220">Do I move my phone around?</span> <span data-start="758260">What is this circle on the floor?</span> <span data-start="760000">I've never seen this before.</span> <span data-start="761920">You have to actually guide users to the path of success here.</span> <span data-start="765190">And West Elm is researching clear directions as well</span> <span data-start="768130">as things like progress bars and loading indicators</span> <span data-start="770597">so that users don't get lost, and they</span> <span data-start="772180">can see how to get to the point that they're actually</span> <span data-start="774388">placing furniture or an object into the real world.</span> <span data-start="778970">After that, once participants successfully placed an object,</span> <span data-start="782230">the most common request was the ability</span> <span data-start="784430">to move it or spin it or even remove it from the scene.</span> <span data-start="787880">The original placement wasn't always where they wanted it to.</span> <span data-start="790594">It wasn't always clear to users how they</span> <span data-start="792260">could do that, in this case.</span> <span data-start="794420">Another thing that they heard from their test subjects</span> <span data-start="798050">as well was that getting validation,</span> <span data-start="800570">that the size of the virtual object matched the real world,</span> <span data-start="803584">would also be helpful.</span> <span data-start="804500">Because if you're shopping for furniture,</span> <span data-start="805760">you want to make sure that it fits into the space</span> <span data-start="807801">that you have.</span> <span data-start="808530">So from that perspective, showing</span> <span data-start="809905">some real-world dimensions with the model could help.</span> <span data-start="813920">And finally, there was some feedback</span> <span data-start="815500">on how real the assets looked.</span> <span data-start="817270">And now this study was particularly unique</span> <span data-start="819430">because West Elm was doing it in-store.</span> <span data-start="821305">And so they had the opportunity to put the virtual object right</span> <span data-start="823930">next to the physical object and get real shopper feedback.</span> <span data-start="827710">Generally speaking, the feedback on realism</span> <span data-start="830200">here was only about 6 out of 10.</span> <span data-start="831947">And you can see clearly that there are</span> <span data-start="833530">differences between the two.</span> <span data-start="835250">So West Elm is looking at how to handle typical lighting</span> <span data-start="837610">scenarios and also make sure that the shadows</span> <span data-start="839560">underneath the object are a little more pronounced and more</span> <span data-start="842018">detailed.</span> <span data-start="843166">So the key message here really is</span> <span data-start="844540">that there's a whole lot of things that you can learn.</span> <span data-start="846320">There's a lot of streamlining going on here.</span> <span data-start="848290">And fundamentally, augmented reality on the web</span> <span data-start="850420">has some differences from apps where somebody might</span> <span data-start="853150">be installing an augmented reality app,</span> <span data-start="855130">and so they're discovering it in a completely different way.</span> <span data-start="859210">Despite those challenges, I think</span> <span data-start="862000">a telling finding from this study</span> <span data-start="864310">was that three of the four participants</span> <span data-start="866080">said they would absolutely, 10 out of 10, use AR,</span> <span data-start="869860">once they knew what that term meant,</span> <span data-start="871540">to do furniture shopping.</span> <span data-start="874030">Now, if you're like me and you grew up</span> <span data-start="876040">with commercials talking about three out of four dentists</span> <span data-start="878500">recommend this toothpaste, you probably</span> <span data-start="880150">all wondered, what does that fourth dentist think?</span> <span data-start="882760">Does it rot teeth?</span> <span data-start="884590">And the answer here is actually maybe.</span> <span data-start="888180">So three people absolutely.</span> <span data-start="889560">One person maybe.</span> <span data-start="890610">I personally visualize that as these</span> <span data-start="892697">are people shopping for home decor, and they said,</span> <span data-start="894780">would you use this?</span> <span data-start="895410">And they're like maybe.</span> <span data-start="896430">I'm here to buy a couch.</span> <span data-start="897720">But I don't actually think that's how it went.</span> <span data-start="900550">But the point here is that three people said absolutely.</span> <span data-start="903330">Pulled from random, three people said absolutely.</span> <span data-start="905700">It's a strong signal.</span> <span data-start="906631">It's also consistent with what we've</span> <span data-start="908130">heard from partners and users who</span> <span data-start="910260">see value and be able to visualize 3D objects ideally</span> <span data-start="913440">in the real world.</span> <span data-start="916390">So if you're thinking about experimenting this</span> <span data-start="918600">and you're thinking about adding this to your website,</span> <span data-start="920400">let's talk a little bit about how you can build things.</span> <span data-start="922830">Chris mentioned the flags you can enable a little bit earlier</span> <span data-start="925110">in the presentation, but let's talk about how you actually</span> <span data-start="927526">add the immersive experience.</span> <span data-start="929060">So you could write WebGL code directly.</span> <span data-start="931417">And if you're doing augmented reality,</span> <span data-start="933000">that would be over top of the camera feed.</span> <span data-start="936030">That's one way you can do it.</span> <span data-start="937410">Generally, we recommend using a library to help.</span> <span data-start="940200">For example, three.js is a helper library</span> <span data-start="942510">for 3D graphics on the web, and it</span> <span data-start="944280">takes care of a lot of the heavy lifting for 3D geometry</span> <span data-start="947280">management and rendering.</span> <span data-start="948420">And it makes it so you don't have</span> <span data-start="949795">to work with WebGL directly.</span> <span data-start="951730">So let's look at an example of how three and WebXR can</span> <span data-start="954327">work together.</span> <span data-start="954910">We're not going to cover the whole process of creating</span> <span data-start="957160">a WebXR session and doing all that,</span> <span data-start="958720">but we are going to look at how a virtual object can be</span> <span data-start="961110">placed into a real-world scene.</span> <span data-start="963400">And we're going to do that with a narrow use case,</span> <span data-start="965490">in this case, putting a reticle onto a real world surface.</span> <span data-start="968785">For those who haven't heard that term before,</span> <span data-start="970660">a reticle is an indicator.</span> <span data-start="972090">In this case, you can see it as it moves around.</span> <span data-start="974130">And it's typically a user interface</span> <span data-start="975780">construct so that the user knows what they can do.</span> <span data-start="978270">You saw some of this in the West Elm screenshots earlier.</span> <span data-start="981820">So what we're going to do first in this case</span> <span data-start="984270">is take the mesh for the reticle, which, in our case,</span> <span data-start="986850">is a flat circle, and we'll add it to the three scene.</span> <span data-start="990090">It's worth noting we'd like the reticle</span> <span data-start="991770">to be about half a meter wide.</span> <span data-start="993630">And so it's worth noting that the WebXR device</span> <span data-start="996210">API locks the coordinate system of the real world</span> <span data-start="999240">to the virtual world.</span> <span data-start="1000740">And what that means is that, one,</span> <span data-start="1002300">in WebGL or the virtual space or in three,</span> <span data-start="1005240">one unit is one meter in the real world.</span> <span data-start="1007370">10 units is 10 meters.</span> <span data-start="1009060">So in this case, if our mesh is half a unit wide,</span> <span data-start="1011870">it means it'll appear as half a meter in the real world.</span> <span data-start="1015920">Next, what we're going to want to do</span> <span data-start="1017420">is actually render the reticle over the camera</span> <span data-start="1020030">on real-world geometry.</span> <span data-start="1021770">But to do that, we need to know where the real world</span> <span data-start="1023990">geometry is.</span> <span data-start="1025579">The WebXR device API includes the capability</span> <span data-start="1028339">to do a hit test, which is firing</span> <span data-start="1030210">a ray into the real world and getting intersection</span> <span data-start="1033079">points with real-world surfaces, so, for example,</span> <span data-start="1035520">taking a ray from my eye, down into the stage,</span> <span data-start="1037994">and then getting the intersection point of where I'm</span> <span data-start="1040160">looking on the stage, but also the normal facing up,</span> <span data-start="1042740">so I know where the surface is and what direction it's facing.</span> <span data-start="1046030">Now, in order to do that, you need a ray.</span> <span data-start="1048202">And a good example of some of the things three can help you</span> <span data-start="1050660">with is a ray caster function, which I don't show here.</span> <span data-start="1053780">But it will let you get the origin and the direction</span> <span data-start="1056360">of the ray that you're going to fire</span> <span data-start="1057860">into the scene from the camera.</span> <span data-start="1059339">So we've already got that here.</span> <span data-start="1060630">And what we're going to do is pass that into the hit test</span> <span data-start="1063140">API with WebXR.</span> <span data-start="1065891">And then what we'll do is we'll take the return value.</span> <span data-start="1068140">We'll actually possibly get a list of things,</span> <span data-start="1070300">because it might be more than one object</span> <span data-start="1072280">behind the first hit.</span> <span data-start="1074560">We'll take the first one, the closest,</span> <span data-start="1076690">and we'll convert the position that we</span> <span data-start="1079210">got into a three.js matrix, and then</span> <span data-start="1081580">we'll use that to set the position of the reticle.</span> <span data-start="1083769">And at that point, you're done.</span> <span data-start="1085060">The reticle is now positioned so that it will render directly</span> <span data-start="1087850">over the real-world object that was detected from that ray.</span> <span data-start="1092129">Now, it's worth reiterating that this</span> <span data-start="1093670">works because the virtual coordinate system matches</span> <span data-start="1096130">the real world one.</span> <span data-start="1097117">And obviously, I skipped over a lot of steps here,</span> <span data-start="1099200">but the point really is that you can combine frameworks</span> <span data-start="1101491">like three js with WebXR.</span> <span data-start="1103300">And it's fairly straightforward if you know 3D programming</span> <span data-start="1106360">basics.</span> <span data-start="1108540">But some of you might not know 3D programming basics.</span> <span data-start="1112770">And the fact is that if you've tried</span> <span data-start="1114270">to add a 3D model to your site, you probably</span> <span data-start="1117090">know already it's not super easy.</span> <span data-start="1118740">3D models can be pretty complex both to read and to display.</span> <span data-start="1122970">We saw that, even in the West Elm example,</span> <span data-start="1125610">there were user experience considerations.</span> <span data-start="1127435">If you're starting from scratch, you have to think about,</span> <span data-start="1129810">how do I want to rotate objects, allow people to move them</span> <span data-start="1132226">around, and so forth?</span> <span data-start="1133870">And then there's also responsive design.</span> <span data-start="1135810">If you want this to work on mobile and desktop,</span> <span data-start="1138944">even if you're just doing a simple model</span> <span data-start="1140610">and a turntable view, you have to know how to handle resizing.</span> <span data-start="1144180">Do you need to display a poster image on mobile</span> <span data-start="1146500">to prevent the download of the 3D geometry</span> <span data-start="1149070">until the user actually wants it?</span> <span data-start="1151260">For newer technology, like augmented reality,</span> <span data-start="1154080">ideally, you'd be able to take advantage and progressively</span> <span data-start="1156750">enhance and use some of the capabilities</span> <span data-start="1158970">on different platforms even if they're not</span> <span data-start="1160800">available in all browsers.</span> <span data-start="1162820">And as WebXR comes out and starts moving to stable,</span> <span data-start="1165892">it's one more thing to learn.</span> <span data-start="1167100">It's one more thing to add.</span> <span data-start="1168224">So just know that if you've experimented with this before</span> <span data-start="1170910">and you found it a little bit tricky, you're not alone.</span> <span data-start="1174464">So to that end, the team has been looking at this problem.</span> <span data-start="1176880">And we recently made public an early version of a 3D</span> <span data-start="1180600">model viewer web component.</span> <span data-start="1182220">This is really, really early, but it</span> <span data-start="1183857">does some things today to make life a little bit easier.</span> <span data-start="1186190">And the reason we released it early was to get your feedback.</span> <span data-start="1189460">To give you some context for this web component,</span> <span data-start="1191460">there's three things we're trying to do.</span> <span data-start="1193220">The first is we want you to be able to add</span> <span data-start="1194970">3D models to your site without having to learn 3D programming</span> <span data-start="1198090">or writing 3D code.</span> <span data-start="1199960">The second is we want it to work well and responsibly</span> <span data-start="1202650">across browsers and across different device form</span> <span data-start="1204930">factors with progressive enhancement</span> <span data-start="1207030">to take advantage of capabilities</span> <span data-start="1209910">on browsers where they're available.</span> <span data-start="1212020">And then the third goal is that as new API</span> <span data-start="1213990">ships, such as the WebXR device API,</span> <span data-start="1215959">we want the component to start taking advantage of them</span> <span data-start="1218250">so that you don't have to keep up</span> <span data-start="1219624">to date with all of the changes that are coming out.</span> <span data-start="1223710">So, like I said, it is super early,</span> <span data-start="1225502">but we've made some progress.</span> <span data-start="1226710">And so I want to give you a sense of what</span> <span data-start="1228418">the component can do today.</span> <span data-start="1229580">Let's run through a few examples.</span> <span data-start="1230954">And this is the first one, the simplest use case,</span> <span data-start="1233460">which is a static GLTF model.</span> <span data-start="1235910">For those who haven't heard GLTF before, it is a 3D file format,</span> <span data-start="1239450">and it is a required component of this model viewer</span> <span data-start="1242270">because it's a format that will allow us to work across all</span> <span data-start="1244910">of the different browsers.</span> <span data-start="1247507">Here, you can see that if we add a couple of attributes,</span> <span data-start="1249840">we can bring the model to life.</span> <span data-start="1251670">In this case, we set the background color,</span> <span data-start="1253530">and we set it to auto rotate.</span> <span data-start="1255480">With the controls attribute, we also</span> <span data-start="1256980">can allow the user to spin it around and move it and take</span> <span data-start="1259860">a look at what's going on, then look at it</span> <span data-start="1261660">from the back and the front.</span> <span data-start="1264580">We've also added a poster image capability.</span> <span data-start="1267120">And you could delay the loading of the model,</span> <span data-start="1269430">so you're not consuming data on mobile,</span> <span data-start="1271450">if that's what you want to do.</span> <span data-start="1272890">And the attributes are also dynamic.</span> <span data-start="1274390">So if you add a little script which switches the poster</span> <span data-start="1276681">image back and forth, you can animate it a little bit</span> <span data-start="1278940">to give the user a sense that it's not just another image.</span> <span data-start="1281700">It's actually a 3D model that they could click on.</span> <span data-start="1283860">It works in that way similar to an image tag.</span> <span data-start="1287950">The component also handles some forms of responsive design.</span> <span data-start="1290840">So you can see here that it will scale up for desktop</span> <span data-start="1293570">and it will scale down for mobile.</span> <span data-start="1295160">And it will manage the staging and the lighting</span> <span data-start="1297200">and the rendering of the model properly.</span> <span data-start="1299480">It can also manage multiple instances on the same page,</span> <span data-start="1302510">so it will take care of WebGL from that perspective.</span> <span data-start="1305540">And it uses IntersectionObserver to make</span> <span data-start="1307460">sure it's not burning battery and GPU when you can't actually</span> <span data-start="1311390">see the model.</span> <span data-start="1313890">Finally, the team is experimenting right now</span> <span data-start="1316040">with some of the more progressive enhancement</span> <span data-start="1317915">capabilities.</span> <span data-start="1318650">In this case, you can see they're</span> <span data-start="1320025">experimenting with the WebXR API and incorporating that,</span> <span data-start="1322940">so that you can add more attributes to turn on AR</span> <span data-start="1326000">and do that across different devices.</span> <span data-start="1330600">Again, this is really early.</span> <span data-start="1332100">The team is still working on more features</span> <span data-start="1333870">for user interface and responsive design features</span> <span data-start="1336450">to make it as easy as possible to add a 3D model to a web</span> <span data-start="1338950">page.</span> <span data-start="1339750">Looking forward, there's a lot we</span> <span data-start="1341125">can do on realism, augmented reality use cases,</span> <span data-start="1343290">interactivity.</span> <span data-start="1344340">The whole reason we made this public</span> <span data-start="1345960">is that we'd love you to try it out,</span> <span data-start="1347620">and we'd like to get your feedback in the GitHub.</span> <span data-start="1350010">So if this is something you're interested in,</span> <span data-start="1352450">please do go to the GitHub, take a look,</span> <span data-start="1354330">try it out, and then let us know what you think.</span> <span data-start="1357690">And with that, we're done.</span> <span data-start="1359160">So we covered today a little bit about the WebXR device API.</span> <span data-start="1362550">We talked about three.js.</span> <span data-start="1364110">And we touched briefly on this new early release of the model</span> <span data-start="1368740">viewer web component.</span> <span data-start="1370044">If you're interested in more, this</span> <span data-start="1371460">is the slide to take a picture of.</span> <span data-start="1373230">The links are all on the screen.</span> <span data-start="1374760">If you're watching this at home, you can rewind,</span> <span data-start="1377220">and you can check it out on YouTube later, I imagine,</span> <span data-start="1379440">as well.</span> <span data-start="1380770">And with that, thank you very much.</span> <span data-start="1382600">We thank you for your time.</span> <span
