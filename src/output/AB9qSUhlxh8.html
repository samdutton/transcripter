<section><span data-start="6748"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: I'm Adam Argyle.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="8225"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: I'm Jason Miller.</span> <span data-start="9910">We're here to talk to you about Smooth Moves.</span> <span data-start="12280">When we were thinking of what to talk about at CDS this year,</span> <span data-start="16120">we wanted to demonstrate some techniques</span> <span data-start="18640">for optimizing performance of existing applications.</span> <span data-start="22135">So we were trying to think of what's</span> <span data-start="23830">an app that Google doesn't have, something not in our portfolio.</span> <span data-start="27355">It took us a while to come up with something,</span> <span data-start="29230">but I think we kind of hit the nail on the head.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="31420"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: A chat app, they don't have a chat app.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="33586"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: No, it's French.</span> <span data-start="36220">This is an app for cats.</span> <span data-start="39310">Sorry, I knew this slide would be really confusing.</span> <span data-start="42590">So it's a chat app.</span> <span data-start="45820">We've been working on an app that actually facilitates</span> <span data-start="48580">communication between cats.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="49750"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: Meow.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="50500"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: We know cats are working</span> <span data-start="52780">on this uprising against humans of sorts,</span> <span data-start="55810">and we figured that's sort like an opportunity</span> <span data-start="58360">for an app that helps out with this,</span> <span data-start="59890">with the planning and whatnot.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="61190"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: Yeah, so this is what our app looks like.</span> <span data-start="63850">The design is sort of a mix a typical material stuff and take</span> <span data-start="67090">some inspiration from Android messages, among others.</span> <span data-start="69680">And we wanted the UI to be realistically complex and well</span> <span data-start="72620">designed, so that it would be challenging enough</span> <span data-start="74620">for the browser and we could measure our optimizations.</span> <span data-start="77500">And obviously, the text that's in there, that's cat ipsom.</span> <span data-start="81340">I don't speak feline.</span> <span data-start="82232">I don't know what's going on.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="83440"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: I do, but I refuse to make a demo.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="85120"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: So next, we turned on the performance monitor,</span> <span data-start="87330">because it looked good on my machine.</span> <span data-start="88690">We're like, let's measure it.</span> <span data-start="90030">It seems to look like everything's decent enough.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="92310"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Yeah.</span> <span data-start="93101">So, we saw a bit of jank and some</span> <span data-start="96220">of the early user feedback we got was that the app felt slow.</span> <span data-start="100990">We applied a bunch of the techniques</span> <span data-start="102910">that Katie and Hussein talked about in their talk</span> <span data-start="105850">earlier today.</span> <span data-start="107940">But it wasn't cutting it.</span> <span data-start="110240">And there was something else wrong.</span> <span data-start="111700">So we decided to load the video up on a Nexus 5.</span> <span data-start="114190">It's really useful to have a device like this sitting around</span> <span data-start="116890">as you develop for the web.</span> <span data-start="118260">As developers, we often have the privilege</span> <span data-start="120130">of fast devices on fast connections.</span> <span data-start="122460">And that can kind of trick us into thinking</span> <span data-start="124750">that we're meeting our performance goals,</span> <span data-start="127060">when we're actually not out in the real world.</span> <span data-start="129259">So watching the video, you can see it's far from smooth.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="133360"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: Many types of jank are present.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="135820"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: So smooth, it's a word</span> <span data-start="138070">we hear a lot when we're talking about user interface.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="141080"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: It's true, and it can</span> <span data-start="141670">be difficult to describe since it's</span> <span data-start="143140">sort of an invisible metric.</span> <span data-start="144910">If your app is smooth, no one really notices anything</span> <span data-start="147370">is wrong.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="147950"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Right.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="148783"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: So then, what does that really</span> <span data-start="150670">mean that smooth is.</span> <span data-start="151882">We thought smooth could destructure</span> <span data-start="153340">into these attributes really well.</span> <span data-start="154810">So let's break them down.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="155946"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Cool.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="157541"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: Smoothness is something</span> <span data-start="159040">we believe happens when the user feels connected</span> <span data-start="162010">to the app that they're using, like they're directly</span> <span data-start="164320">controlling it, a sort of physical connection</span> <span data-start="166810">to the interface.</span> <span data-start="167711">When the application doesn't respond quickly to input,</span> <span data-start="169960">it breaks this connection, and we feel distanced from the task</span> <span data-start="173230">at hand.</span> <span data-start="173890">It's best when it feels like magic paper.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="176970"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="178510">Yeah, so when an application animates irregularly,</span> <span data-start="182230">it actually distracts us, by breaking something</span> <span data-start="184300">called the illusion of motion.</span> <span data-start="185825">You can see the illustration of what I'm talking about up</span> <span data-start="188200">here on the right.</span> <span data-start="190360">The eye responds to light changes at 10 times per second.</span> <span data-start="194570">So if we show the eye a sequence of 10 images per second,</span> <span data-start="198250">we can actually still see each individual frame.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="201340"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: Yeah.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="202390"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: So the brain doesn't necessarily</span> <span data-start="204306">interpret that as motion.</span> <span data-start="206150">If we increase this to 20 frames per second,</span> <span data-start="208540">somewhere in and around the red orb there,</span> <span data-start="212009">we start to interpret this as motion,</span> <span data-start="213550">because we've exceeded two times the number of light changes</span> <span data-start="216100">we can detect.</span> <span data-start="217120">And this effect increases as we approach</span> <span data-start="219061">60 frames per second, where we start to see some diminishing</span> <span data-start="221560">returns.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="222440"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: Yep.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="223240"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Basically, smoothness</span> <span data-start="224830">relates to the human perception of performance.</span> <span data-start="228850">It's a measure of the question, is this application</span> <span data-start="232120">keeping up with me?</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="233680"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: Or does this app feel</span> <span data-start="235120">like it's helping me get something done,</span> <span data-start="236800">or is it getting in my way?</span> <span data-start="239062">The way the user feels when interacting with software</span> <span data-start="241270">is really important.</span> <span data-start="243010">Because we've all been in situations like this.</span> <span data-start="245690">I mean, he was obviously trying to send a tweet.</span> <span data-start="249069">And it just wasn't working out.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="250360"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: He probably should have used some newer hardware.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="252485"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: Yeah, well, he's breaking it now.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="254612"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: So this is backed up by statistics too.</span> <span data-start="256820">In a 2017 study, 46% of people who</span> <span data-start="260470">had an interruptive mobile experience</span> <span data-start="262660">said they wouldn't purchase from that brand again in the future.</span> <span data-start="265940">And in that same study, they found that 79% of people</span> <span data-start="269140">said they're more likely to revisit or share</span> <span data-start="271720">a mobile site that was easy to use.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="274015"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: And another metric, and it's a good one,</span> <span data-start="276435">100% of Adams say they doubt a thing's reliability</span> <span data-start="279510">if it hiccups while performing its task.</span> <span data-start="281650">Maybe you agree.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="282890"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="284560">So anytime we talk about the perception of performance,</span> <span data-start="287320">it's useful to frame things using the RAIL model.</span> <span data-start="290810">RAIL provides a set of goals that</span> <span data-start="292660">cover the four ways we all perceive performance</span> <span data-start="295000">and speed when using software.</span> <span data-start="297320">Those are Response, which is reacting</span> <span data-start="299440">to events in 100 milliseconds, Animation, which is producing</span> <span data-start="302230">frames in 16 milliseconds, Idol, which is maximizing idle time,</span> <span data-start="306280">and Load, which is loading in under one second.</span> <span data-start="309260">And these are based off of like a few years, a few decades,</span> <span data-start="312550">actually, worth of research.</span> <span data-start="313810">So they're very unlikely to change.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="315080"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: And you know what this slide looks like to me</span> <span data-start="317496">is click, run, swipe, and load.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="319314"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Yeah, we could have used a different acronym</span> <span data-start="321730">there, I guess.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="322522"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: We'll get there.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="323730"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Cool, so there's times</span> <span data-start="326510">that we have to hit for all these.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="329540"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: And we believe responding to user input</span> <span data-start="332240">quickly is the first and arguably most important thing</span> <span data-start="335150">to do in your app for it to feel or appear smooth and snappy.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="338780"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Right, even sticking to RAIL's goals</span> <span data-start="340970">though, idle work can potentially delay input</span> <span data-start="343649">by up to 50 milliseconds, which we're going</span> <span data-start="345440">to hear about in a second.</span> <span data-start="346523">But we recommend responding to input in 50 milliseconds</span> <span data-start="350600">in order to have the combined time never exceed 100.</span> <span data-start="353060">That's why you'll see the difference between the goal</span> <span data-start="355268">and the guideline.</span> <span data-start="356900">Animation has a similar story.</span> <span data-start="358250">So there's more than just our code</span> <span data-start="359666">that has to run in order to get a frame on the screen.</span> <span data-start="362559">To account for a reasonable amount of browser rendering</span> <span data-start="364850">overhead, we recommend shooting for 10 milliseconds</span> <span data-start="367220">of your JavaScript time to produce that frame,</span> <span data-start="369532">leaving six left over for the browser.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="371115"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: Browser are so cool.</span> <span data-start="372490">We're talking about six milliseconds, 10 milliseconds,</span> <span data-start="374750">who could do anything in that amount of time?</span> <span data-start="376625">And the browser's doing crazy stuff.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="378220"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Right.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="379053"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: It's so rad.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="380430"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: So in order to — </span> <span data-start="381680">in addition to deferring as much work as possible,</span> <span data-start="384750">it's also good to defer your working 50 millisecond chunks.</span> <span data-start="387470">This is where that response metric gets its differentiation</span> <span data-start="391270">from.</span> <span data-start="391770">So if you have 50 millisecond blocking idle tasks,</span> <span data-start="395300">there's a chance that any one of those</span> <span data-start="396980">could cause input to be queued for 50 milliseconds, which</span> <span data-start="399980">means if you need to respond in 100,</span> <span data-start="401750">you only have 50 milliseconds left.</span> <span data-start="403460">So that's where that metric comes from.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="405160"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: And the load goals, based on research,</span> <span data-start="407285">is showing that we generally lose focus</span> <span data-start="410330">after about one second.</span> <span data-start="411800">We start to feel a bit disconnected</span> <span data-start="413420">from the activity we're doing.</span> <span data-start="414840">And then at 10 seconds, we become frustrated,</span> <span data-start="417530">we go grab a sledgehammer, and probably</span> <span data-start="419540">light something on fire.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="420652"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: That's how that picture happened.</span> <span data-start="422610">So RAIL's guideline for load is kind</span> <span data-start="425420">of right in the middle of those two numbers.</span> <span data-start="427460">We set it up five seconds.</span> <span data-start="428926">And this is a good metric for something</span> <span data-start="430550">like a page load, where you're waiting</span> <span data-start="432133">for a decent amount of new content to come in,</span> <span data-start="435830">even a whole screen's worth of content.</span> <span data-start="438080">For little interactions, though, like the sending button</span> <span data-start="440540">in our chat app, it's actually best</span> <span data-start="442250">to shoot for that one second goal.</span> <span data-start="443937">There's only a small amount of content</span> <span data-start="445520">being changed on screen.</span> <span data-start="446760">So it's not as perceivable to the user.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="449162"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: Yep, and with RAIL we</span> <span data-start="452452">have a nice mental model for figuring out</span> <span data-start="454160">why the app feels slow.</span> <span data-start="455610">And it helps us set a useful challenge.</span> <span data-start="457970">And you'll notice on each slide, as we continue here,</span> <span data-start="460277">there'll be a little badge in the top right.</span> <span data-start="462110">It's have an R, an A, an I, and an L,</span> <span data-start="463820">add it'll pertain to the RAIL model.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="465320"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="466153">So, we're pretty confident that we can meet RAIL guidelines</span> <span data-start="468620">on a $1,500 laptop, or maybe some other very popular laptop.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="474564"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: Yeah, that's a cush laptop there.</span> <span data-start="476480">Kind of looks like it's on John Snow's bed or something</span> <span data-start="478771">like that.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="479426"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Yeah, I've never seen "Game of Thrones."</span> <span data-start="481676">I assume that's a reference to "Game of Thrones."</span> <span data-start="484057">So we could do it on the laptop.</span> <span data-start="485390">But can we meet our guidelines on a sub $100 phone?</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="489660"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: Uh, duh, the web is awesome.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="492020"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Yes, so we want our apps</span> <span data-start="494990">to be smooth everywhere.</span> <span data-start="496370">And what we need to do to ensure that is</span> <span data-start="498114">to optimize for the lowest common denominator.</span> <span data-start="500030">We need to be 60 frames per second on low-end hardware.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="503894"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: So before we embark on a challenge like this,</span> <span data-start="506310">though, we need to be able to measure whether we're meeting</span> <span data-start="508880">those guidelines or not.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="509980"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="510950">So all the tools that we have available to measure</span> <span data-start="513620">these things, live in Chrome DevTools.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="515240"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: DevTools.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="516110"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="516943">We have seen a bunch of them earlier today.</span> <span data-start="518929">In Paul, Elizabeth's TALK they talked specifically</span> <span data-start="521120">about DevTools.</span> <span data-start="522539">We're actually going to show a couple of features in DevTools</span> <span data-start="525080">that are maybe a little bit less commonly</span> <span data-start="526788">used, some of them potentially even lost to the sands of time.</span> <span data-start="531410">So let's get into them.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="532369"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: The first tool is down</span> <span data-start="533826">in the drawer, which you can pull up using the Escape key.</span> <span data-start="536370">It's the rendering panel.</span> <span data-start="538037">It lets you visualize important things</span> <span data-start="539620">that we're going to get into today, like painting layer</span> <span data-start="541911">borders and live SPF meter.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="543890"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="545550">The second useful tool is up in three</span> <span data-start="547220">dot menu in the upper right.</span> <span data-start="548630">It's called Layers.</span> <span data-start="549830">It shows a real time view of the layers that make up your page.</span> <span data-start="552735">We're going to deep dive into this in a little bit.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="554860"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: [INAUDIBLE]</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="555650"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: But it's useful to remember that DevTools</span> <span data-start="557941">has you covered here.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="559010"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: The next tool's back down in the drawer again.</span> <span data-start="561140">It's the graphs we showed earlier,</span> <span data-start="562556">called the Performance Monitor.</span> <span data-start="564020">And here you can monitor various aspects</span> <span data-start="566030">of your app's performance, chart it over time.</span> <span data-start="568550">Plus, it looks so good on a dark theme.</span> <span data-start="571280">I just love that.</span> <span data-start="572572">It's pretty useful to find hiccups.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="599010"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: Cool, all right, it's business time.</span> <span data-start="602480">We're equipped with some tools and strategies on how</span> <span data-start="604850">to investigate performance.</span> <span data-start="606680">Let's dive in.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="607730"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Let's dive in.</span> <span data-start="609030">So we came up with three types of optimizations</span> <span data-start="611900">that we hope will help address common performance issues.</span> <span data-start="615230">We have efficient animations, reading and then writing,</span> <span data-start="618230">and then sort of a grab bag of things</span> <span data-start="620480">that we're calling lazy winds.</span> <span data-start="622730">So that's sort of a mix.</span> <span data-start="624760">So we'll start off with efficient animations.</span> <span data-start="627110">Animating things effectively in the browser</span> <span data-start="629060">really requires a somewhat deep understanding</span> <span data-start="632270">of how browsers render.</span> <span data-start="634190">Let's say we want to build like the chat UI</span> <span data-start="637100">that we showed in the intro.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="638425"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: Chat UI.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="639300"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Right, chat, sorry.</span> <span data-start="641270">We want to write some HTML, give it a bunch of fancy styling,</span> <span data-start="644300">and then arbitrary magic happens and you</span> <span data-start="646490">have pixels on a screen.</span> <span data-start="647992">That level of understanding is not enough</span> <span data-start="649700">for us to be able to optimize here.</span> <span data-start="651560">So let's dig into it.</span> <span data-start="652640">We start off with some HTML.</span> <span data-start="654800">This all gets passed and turned into a tree structure</span> <span data-start="657765">that we call the Dom.</span> <span data-start="658640">You're familiar with the Dom.</span> <span data-start="661010">And this sort of preps us to the point</span> <span data-start="662630">where we're ready to render, which is a four-step process.</span> <span data-start="666360">The first step is style calculation.</span> <span data-start="668315">So the browser needs to compute all the styles for the elements</span> <span data-start="670940">that you see, which is resolving things to their final values,</span> <span data-start="674570">resolving CSS custom properties, inherited values, et cetera.</span> <span data-start="677257">And it does this by going through all the elements</span> <span data-start="679340">and figuring out which CSS properties apply to them.</span> <span data-start="683090">With those values calculated, we can figure out</span> <span data-start="685400">the positions of where all those elements are on the screen.</span> <span data-start="688475">So you see those are represented as boxes up here on the right.</span> <span data-start="691100">The cost of this calculation step varies quite a bit.</span> <span data-start="694410">Some types of layouts are multi-packs,</span> <span data-start="696142">which means that they need to be laid out</span> <span data-start="697850">multiple times before they're in their final resting state.</span> <span data-start="700550">And other types, like position absolute, are just static.</span> <span data-start="704090">So they only need to be one pass.</span> <span data-start="706520">So that computed layout has enough information</span> <span data-start="708890">to break things up into pieces that we call paint layers.</span> <span data-start="712260">Here in the painting process, we walk through all the paint</span> <span data-start="715190">layers and we convert the layered information</span> <span data-start="717170">that we had into Draw commands.</span> <span data-start="719730">And these sort of look like the 2D canvas API,</span> <span data-start="722090">if you've used that.</span> <span data-start="724180">So Chrome takes these and it sends them over</span> <span data-start="726380">to its graphics layer, which is called Skia.</span> <span data-start="728930">And those get rasterized and sent back</span> <span data-start="731090">as image representations.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="732350"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: Wait a second, Chrome, they're skias?</span> <span data-start="735140">I thought they were snowboarders.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="737360"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: No, all skias.</span> <span data-start="738820">OK so, with the paint layers rasterized,</span> <span data-start="741950">the last step is to composite them.</span> <span data-start="743810">So this step takes all the rasterized essentially images</span> <span data-start="746480">at this point and lays them out on top of each other</span> <span data-start="748940">in order to make things look like the final page.</span> <span data-start="751709">So what you get is the result on the right,</span> <span data-start="753500">which is what we wanted.</span> <span data-start="755630">This whole process applies anytime</span> <span data-start="757400">you have page updates that are triggered by JavaScript</span> <span data-start="760220">manipulating the Dom.</span> <span data-start="762080">So let's say we want to update the left property</span> <span data-start="764720">of a div, left position of a div.</span> <span data-start="767540">The browser is going to have to recalculate styles.</span> <span data-start="770630">It's going to have to redo the layout, because they have</span> <span data-start="773240">changed, paint all the paint layers that changed,</span> <span data-start="778190">and then composite them together to form the resulting page.</span> <span data-start="781280">Yeah, lot of work.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="782240"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: A lot of work.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="783860"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: And then if we set the transform property</span> <span data-start="786170">for some contrast, transform opacity</span> <span data-start="789170">and filter are all what's called compositable properties.</span> <span data-start="792870">So modifying these doesn't actually trigger layout</span> <span data-start="795230">and can often bypass paint.</span> <span data-start="797280">So you go straight from style recalculation to compositing.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="799990"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: [INAUDIBLE]</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="800990"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Yeah, so a lot less work.</span> <span data-start="803060">These things, they get really important when</span> <span data-start="805880">you're animating.</span> <span data-start="807080">On every frame we are now potentially computing layout,</span> <span data-start="810890">if you set something like width or left.</span> <span data-start="814350">And this is a lot of work for the browser to do.</span> <span data-start="816620">This is going to be a low frame rate.</span> <span data-start="819380">Animating something like color, layout</span> <span data-start="821090">isn't required because you're not</span> <span data-start="822110">changing the bounds of the position of the element.</span> <span data-start="824430">So on each frame, you're recalculating styles, painting,</span> <span data-start="826970">and compositing.</span> <span data-start="827690">You skip the layout step.</span> <span data-start="829020">A little better.</span> <span data-start="830000">This used to be a performance concern.</span> <span data-start="831750">But in modern graphics pipelines,</span> <span data-start="833480">it's actually pretty fast.</span> <span data-start="835730">Finally, animating compositable properties,</span> <span data-start="837950">like transform opacity, all that work</span> <span data-start="840792">is handled by the compositor.</span> <span data-start="842000">So this is really good for things like responding</span> <span data-start="844640">to pan gestures.</span> <span data-start="845562">Because it's important to keep that pipeline as</span> <span data-start="847520">short as possible.</span> <span data-start="848557">The one thing to keep in mind, though,</span> <span data-start="850140">is that compositing is not free.</span> <span data-start="853131">If you're on resource constrained devices,</span> <span data-start="854880">you really need to watch your composited layer count.</span> <span data-start="857552">If it gets too high, you can hit memory [INAUDIBLE]..</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="859760"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: You pretty much have jank permanently.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="863505"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: So we had a send button in our application,</span> <span data-start="865880">and depending on whether it was enabled</span> <span data-start="867505">or disabled, whether there was text in the text field</span> <span data-start="869960">beside it, it would have a large or a small box shadow</span> <span data-start="873080">and change its color.</span> <span data-start="874560">So originally, we just did a CSS transition on the box shadow.</span> <span data-start="878446">Box shadows are paint-based animations,</span> <span data-start="880070">because they physically cannot affect layout.</span> <span data-start="882962">And that meant that on every frame, what we had to do</span> <span data-start="885170">was send a bunch of new commands over to Skia,</span> <span data-start="887900">like we saw in those demos.</span> <span data-start="889285">So here's an example of what that</span> <span data-start="890660">might look like in a three-frame animation.</span> <span data-start="892580">And you see it's pretty much repeating the same process</span> <span data-start="894871">each time with new variables.</span> <span data-start="896970">We tried switching this to a composite animation.</span> <span data-start="899270">And the way we did that was we duplicated the button</span> <span data-start="901820">using a pseudo element.</span> <span data-start="904050">And then the foreground was the element</span> <span data-start="906070">and the background was a pseudo element with the same shape,</span> <span data-start="908570">but a box shadow applied to it.</span> <span data-start="910680">And then all we have to do is change the opacity of the box</span> <span data-start="913640">shadow pseudo element behind the button,</span> <span data-start="916550">and we can get any of the frames of the animation we</span> <span data-start="919130">want between 0 and 100 using just composited animations.</span> <span data-start="924782">So any frame can be constructed from just those two paints.</span> <span data-start="927240">We do not need to repaint.</span> <span data-start="928489">You can see this in action too.</span> <span data-start="929780">So looking at DevTools — </span> </section>

<section><span data-start="931750"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Yeah, we've got a paint-based animation</span> <span data-start="933090">on the top.</span> <span data-start="933590">That's just box shadow.</span> <span data-start="934770">The center one is animating the opacity of a shadow element.</span> <span data-start="937865">And then the bottom one is sort of the penultimate,</span> <span data-start="939990">this is animating the transform's scale</span> <span data-start="943290">of the shadow.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="946560"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Yeah, so paints at the beginning,</span> <span data-start="947610">paints at the end.</span> <span data-start="948460">This is when it's being promoted and then demoted</span> <span data-start="951464">to a composited layer.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="954780"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: That's a bummer.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="955500"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: So we did this experiment.</span> <span data-start="957270">The profiler told us that this was a good idea.</span> <span data-start="959989">Obviously, there's a lot less main thread work going on</span> <span data-start="962280">in the second two animations.</span> <span data-start="963488">These are in order.</span> <span data-start="965130">And so this might be something we would want to do.</span> <span data-start="967500">Except if we're targeting really low-end mobile devices,</span> <span data-start="970500">where they might not have the best GPUs.</span> <span data-start="973380">The reason why this is good is because GPUs</span> <span data-start="975870">are really good at transforming composited layers.</span> <span data-start="979860">It's important to remember that this is not a silver bullet,</span> <span data-start="982570">though.</span> <span data-start="983100">You always want to make sure that you profile,</span> <span data-start="985410">and that your performance improvements on desktop</span> <span data-start="988680">don't become problems on mobile.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1012392"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: And I think when we were doing our performance</span> <span data-start="1014891">optimizations, we just switched our max height</span> <span data-start="1017630">animation to be slide in.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1022760"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: OK, so we talked about efficient animations.</span> <span data-start="1025605">But there's another whole aspect of rendering</span> <span data-start="1027480">that's really important if you want to hit that</span> <span data-start="1029438">60 frames per second target.</span> <span data-start="1031010">And that's this idea of reading and then writing.</span> <span data-start="1034310">To understand this, we need to take a trip down</span> <span data-start="1036710">to the rendering assembly line.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1039412"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: Yeah.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1040376"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: So ideally, when we</span> <span data-start="1041750">look at an app in the performance tab of DevTools,</span> <span data-start="1044250">we see little chunks of this sequence.</span> <span data-start="1046190">And these are the frames.</span> <span data-start="1048200">In an ideal situation, there's a lot of whitespace</span> <span data-start="1051077">in between these, which means that you don't</span> <span data-start="1052910">have a lot of idle time work.</span> <span data-start="1054118">Your app is sort of main thread jank free.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1056300"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: This looks like Jake Archibald's socks.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1058880"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: I think those are the color profile we went with.</span> <span data-start="1062280">Yeah, so we peeked at the anatomy of a frame earlier.</span> <span data-start="1065210">We have style recalculation, layout, paint, compositing.</span> <span data-start="1069051">We didn't really dig into the script</span> <span data-start="1070550">portion, that initial portion that</span> <span data-start="1072320">leads off this whole thing.</span> <span data-start="1073550">And as it turns out, it's really important.</span> <span data-start="1075800">Not all scripts are created equal.</span> <span data-start="1079020">So our interaction with the Dom affects every other step</span> <span data-start="1081470">in the rendering process.</span> <span data-start="1083090">And we can split out the two types</span> <span data-start="1085100">of scripting into two groups.</span> <span data-start="1087270">We have read and then write.</span> <span data-start="1089024">On the left, you can see some examples of properties</span> <span data-start="1091190">that are Dom layout reads.</span> <span data-start="1092926">Some of these are pretty obvious, offset top,</span> <span data-start="1094800">obviously if you want to know where the element is,</span> <span data-start="1096925">you need to lay it out.</span> <span data-start="1098260">Some of these are not so obvious though.</span> <span data-start="1100350">Inner text inserts, it's a string.</span> <span data-start="1102589">It's kind of like text content.</span> <span data-start="1103880">But there's new lines in it based on layout.</span> <span data-start="1106520">If you have paragraphs or elements with display block,</span> <span data-start="1109580">the string has new lines in it.</span> <span data-start="1111070">And it's impossible to return that string without calculating</span> <span data-start="1113780">layout first.</span> <span data-start="1115160">If you're using inner text in your app,</span> <span data-start="1116930">and you're not using it specifically for that feature,</span> <span data-start="1119180">I would strongly recommend going with text content.</span> <span data-start="1122311">On the right is maybe a little bit more obvious.</span> <span data-start="1124310">If you change CSS layout, add elements, mutate the Dom tree</span> <span data-start="1127580">structure, you're going to trigger layout.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1134630"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: So let's say we have a timeline like before,</span> <span data-start="1136980">but this time there's two bits of script that</span> <span data-start="1138470">are going to run.</span> <span data-start="1139280">The first sets the width of an element to 10 pixels.</span> <span data-start="1142730">The second script, maybe it's a different script,</span> <span data-start="1144800">asks how much space is left aside beside fu — </span> <span data-start="1148010">how much space is left beside that div?</span> <span data-start="1150152">And in order to do this, it's going</span> <span data-start="1151610">use the offset width property.</span> <span data-start="1153350">This is where things fall apart.</span> <span data-start="1155120">We hadn't had a chance to calculate style and layout.</span> <span data-start="1158970">So we have to do that synchronicity now,</span> <span data-start="1162264">which is going to be forced.</span> <span data-start="1163430">So we have to block the main thread, do all that work,</span> <span data-start="1166220">and then come back to the script that asked for that width.</span> <span data-start="1168839">And the worst part is, that script actually</span> <span data-start="1170630">did this to conditionally then set</span> <span data-start="1172730">the width of fu, which invalidates</span> <span data-start="1174860">the layout and the style calculations we did,</span> <span data-start="1177140">which means that they have to happen again.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1217756"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="1218840">So if you pop open the profiler on an arbitrary website,</span> <span data-start="1223350">you might find this technique in play, where</span> <span data-start="1225870">it's not actually panning out.</span> <span data-start="1227940">And the reason for that is deferring</span> <span data-start="1229890">reads using request animation frame doesn't really</span> <span data-start="1232650">fix this problem.</span> <span data-start="1234130">It's still going to trigger forced synchronous layout</span> <span data-start="1237630">inside of the raf callback, which can sometimes be worse.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1240315"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: That's tricky.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1241440"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Yeah, so we're going</span> <span data-start="1242856">to end up in the same situation we had before.</span> <span data-start="1245592">So reading properties that require layout information</span> <span data-start="1247800">before modifying layout is an important thing</span> <span data-start="1249840">to keep in mind when interacting with the Dom.</span> <span data-start="1253870">This brings us to our variety portion of the show, which</span> <span data-start="1257620">we have called lazy wins.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1259902"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: All right, and so earlier we</span> <span data-start="1261610">were talking about smooth, and it was described as connected,</span> <span data-start="1264370">silky, and asynchronous.</span> <span data-start="1266160">I feel like this crowd is savvy about the topic of synch</span> <span data-start="1268690">versus asynch and how to be polite to threads or a thread.</span> <span data-start="1272920">But it's not often enough that we are considerate of our users</span> <span data-start="1275860">thread.</span> <span data-start="1276790">They're often pressed for time and resources as well.</span> <span data-start="1279560">So we should do our best to keep their thread free of locking.</span> <span data-start="1282250">Our first version had synchronous interactions,</span> <span data-start="1285280">just like the animation here.</span> <span data-start="1286600">It's kind of painful to watch, right.</span> <span data-start="1288760">You're like, hey — </span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1289749"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: I hope it's done.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1294697"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: So here's a demo of us sending.</span> <span data-start="1296530">It's called rough moves.</span> <span data-start="1297460">You'll like that.</span> <span data-start="1298180">Notice how this one, we have a new message or thought,</span> <span data-start="1301720">can't be started until the previous one is finished.</span> <span data-start="1304460">And it's not too bad when you send one message,</span> <span data-start="1306430">but when you're sending many, you're</span> <span data-start="1307929">going to be super disruptive.</span> <span data-start="1309400">The user interaction implementation</span> <span data-start="1310990">was easier for the engineers because they</span> <span data-start="1312700">could handle the flow being synchronous about it.</span> <span data-start="1314741">It's sort of like less work for me.</span> <span data-start="1318140">But we redid it.</span> <span data-start="1320230">And so here's the same thought process being typed out.</span> <span data-start="1323126">And these messages are being sent</span> <span data-start="1324500">using asynchronous, almost sort of known as optimistic</span> <span data-start="1327410">interactions.</span> <span data-start="1328290">And the user is never blocked.</span> <span data-start="1329540">They're free to express themselves</span> <span data-start="1330956">at the rate at which they desire and are capable.</span> <span data-start="1333102">And this can increase the perceived performance</span> <span data-start="1335060">of your application because it doesn't</span> <span data-start="1336643">appear to stall or think too hard about certain tasks.</span> <span data-start="1340700">Measuring smoothness as a UX metric</span> <span data-start="1342290">can be a difficult thing to quantify or qualify,</span> <span data-start="1344810">but luckily the experts at Google have devised a fantastic</span> <span data-start="1348110">framework for evaluating the quality a UX,</span> <span data-start="1350092">and therefore, its perceived performance.</span> <span data-start="1351800">It is called Heart.</span> <span data-start="1353010">And I wanted to throw this in there,</span> <span data-start="1354050">because it's the sort of mix of lazy wins,</span> <span data-start="1355800">because it can help you measure the impact of your UI</span> <span data-start="1358400">interaction paradigms.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1359722"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Cool.</span> <span data-start="1360990">So one quick way to improve your application's performance,</span> <span data-start="1363590">is to just find a browser primitive</span> <span data-start="1365720">that is more efficient than something</span> <span data-start="1367280">manual you're doing today.</span> <span data-start="1369289">A great example of this would be position sticky.</span> <span data-start="1371330">The manual implementation of position sticky</span> <span data-start="1373880">requires querying for layout information</span> <span data-start="1375980">while you're scrolling, in the scroll handler.</span> <span data-start="1378920">This is really expensive.</span> <span data-start="1380210">This triggers all the bad performance problems</span> <span data-start="1382126">we saw before.</span> <span data-start="1383780">Another one would be to leverage native scrolling,</span> <span data-start="1386600">by swapping out your custom scroll implementation,</span> <span data-start="1388740">scroll smoothing implementation, for scroll interview</span> <span data-start="1391430">with behavior smooth.</span> <span data-start="1392450">This is relatively new.</span> <span data-start="1394061">This feature is awesome.</span> <span data-start="1395060">It made building our chat UI really easy.</span> <span data-start="1397440">The only thing that we had to do, we were firing at a lot,</span> <span data-start="1399860">so we actually de-balanced it, using request idle callback.</span> <span data-start="1402575">So we only scroll into view once the main thread's settled down</span> <span data-start="1405200">and messages have stopped being fetched.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1406460"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: That was a really slick one too.</span> <span data-start="1407690">Because on an old device — </span> <span data-start="1408950">we had a test where we hammered messages in there.</span> <span data-start="1411530">We sent like 30 of them over the span of three seconds.</span> <span data-start="1413830">And an older device was able to not be</span> <span data-start="1416240">overwhelmed because we were nice about asking</span> <span data-start="1419014">when to smooth scroll.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1419930"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Right.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1420320"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: So the messages would pour in it</span> <span data-start="1422580">and then smooth down to the bottom.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1424070"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: It'll wait.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1424860"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: It'll wait, and on a nice machine,</span> <span data-start="1426230">they just poured right in, because it was powerful enough.</span> <span data-start="1428646">It was easy.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1429350"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: OK, so just like scrolling,</span> <span data-start="1431300">panning is a gesture where we expect</span> <span data-start="1433010">to feel like we're physically pushing content around</span> <span data-start="1435847">on the screen.</span> <span data-start="1436430">We want to have that connection between our thumb</span> <span data-start="1438471">and the pixels.</span> <span data-start="1439190">In a well-built custom panning implementation,</span> <span data-start="1442070">touch input received by the browser is sent to the page,</span> <span data-start="1445340">and then the JavaScript input handling code</span> <span data-start="1447140">responds by updating probably the transform property</span> <span data-start="1449660">on an element, and then that is rendered by sending that back</span> <span data-start="1452450">to the compositor, which results in pixels on the screen.</span> <span data-start="1456012">So this actually works pretty well.</span> <span data-start="1457470">But we can do better.</span> <span data-start="1458960">In browser scrolling, optimal browser scrolling,</span> <span data-start="1462265">we don't have to wait for JavaScript event handlers</span> <span data-start="1464390">to complete.</span> <span data-start="1465110">We could just directly translate that layer on the compositor.</span> <span data-start="1468170">Events will eventually get sent over to the page,</span> <span data-start="1470859">but in an ideal setup where passive event listeners are</span> <span data-start="1473150">being used, they could be fire and forget.</span> <span data-start="1475131">And this is going to get your shortest time to pixels.</span> <span data-start="1477380">So here's an example of that manual kind</span> <span data-start="1479120">of panning, the first kind.</span> <span data-start="1481050">It's a simple carousel.</span> <span data-start="1482202">These are my pets by the way.</span> <span data-start="1483410">My wife required that I said that.</span> <span data-start="1486020">So it's using pointer events.</span> <span data-start="1487500">And it sets a transform property on the layer.</span> <span data-start="1490054">There's some problems with this, though.</span> <span data-start="1491720">So we're getting composited animation, which is good,</span> <span data-start="1494780">but the implementation is non-trivial.</span> <span data-start="1496871">Especially if you want to integrate really</span> <span data-start="1498620">well with the browsers own page scrolling, if you're panning,</span> <span data-start="1501860">and the person's thumb starts to move more up than left</span> <span data-start="1504685">or right, you really need to cancel that animation.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1506810"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: Get that uncanny scrolly valley.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1508787"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Yeah, right.</span> <span data-start="1509870">So another option here would be to use</span> <span data-start="1511970">something called scroll snaps.</span> <span data-start="1513860">So this is really elegant.</span> <span data-start="1515660">Basically, instead of all the manual implementation,</span> <span data-start="1518820">you just put two CSS properties on that carousel.</span> <span data-start="1521090">The first is scroll snap type.</span> <span data-start="1522770">We just said we want to do it in the x-axis and always snap.</span> <span data-start="1526160">And the second is scroll snap align,</span> <span data-start="1527792">which just tells it to snap to the beginning of each image.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1530250"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: So cool.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1531124"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: And what this looks like is this.</span> <span data-start="1533150">So this requires a lot less code to implement.</span> <span data-start="1536700">It's still composited, but this one</span> <span data-start="1538340">doesn't rely on the main thread at all,</span> <span data-start="1540380">and it feels natural on each platform.</span> <span data-start="1542150">Because the easing, rather than being manually implemented,</span> <span data-start="1545000">is just the platform's native scroll easing.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1546360"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: Yeah, you get the bounce at the end for free.</span> <span data-start="1548060">You get to throw it.</span> <span data-start="1549120">I mean, the whole nine.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1551090"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: So to sum things up, make</span> <span data-start="1553550">sure you're keeping the browser's rendering</span> <span data-start="1555530">pipeline in mind when you're animating</span> <span data-start="1557980">and always try to avoid animating layout.</span> <span data-start="1561710">Sync up your Dom access so you read</span> <span data-start="1564080">properties that require layout information before mutating</span> <span data-start="1567260">the Dom and causing layout.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1569790"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: And consider using optimistic interactions,</span> <span data-start="1572150">because they can sometimes be better</span> <span data-start="1573650">than optimizing rendering, especially</span> <span data-start="1575899">if you're just getting started.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1577190"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="1578023">And finally, take advantage of places</span> <span data-start="1580340">where you can offload the most performance critical work,</span> <span data-start="1583520">and rendering to the browser.</span> <span data-start="1585230">If you can leverage something like scroll snapping</span> <span data-start="1587990">or position sticky to implement your designs,</span> <span data-start="1590570">that might be the biggest performance win of all.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1593162"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: It's a lazy win.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="1594370"><span class="speaker">Jason Miller</span>: Right, cool.</span> <span data-start="1595580">So thanks everybody.</span> <span data-start="1596600">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="1597350">[MUSIC PLAYING]</span> </section>
