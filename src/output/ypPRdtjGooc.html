<section><span data-start="6.765" data-end="8.64"><span class="speaker">Justin Fagnani</span>: So my name is Justin Fagnani.</span> <span data-start="8.64" data-end="11.37">And I work in Chrome on things like Web Components, polymer,</span> <span data-start="11.37" data-end="12.477">and lit-html.</span> <span data-start="12.477" data-end="15.06">And right now, I'm going to talk about the virtue of laziness.</span> <span data-start="18.12" data-end="19.67">Next slide.</span> <span data-start="19.67" data-end="21.16">Advance.</span> <span data-start="21.16" data-end="23.207">Today is the day.</span> <span data-start="23.207" data-end="23.79">That happened.</span> <span data-start="23.79" data-end="25.32">Yeah, OK.</span> <span data-start="25.32" data-end="29.67">So we're going to look at how to do less, be lazy, and take</span> <span data-start="29.67" data-end="33.48">breaks, and end up with a better web application for it.</span> <span data-start="33.48" data-end="35.49">And when I say better, I'm really</span> <span data-start="35.49" data-end="38.13">talking about four overlapping goals here.</span> <span data-start="38.13" data-end="40.31">We want to deliver great user experiences.</span> <span data-start="40.31" data-end="42.69">And we want our apps to be fast and to respond quickly</span> <span data-start="42.69" data-end="44.58">to input and changes.</span> <span data-start="44.58" data-end="46.08">And more than just making fast apps</span> <span data-start="46.08" data-end="48.12">or making it possible to build fast apps,</span> <span data-start="48.12" data-end="50.25">we want to make this easy, so easy</span> <span data-start="50.25" data-end="52.44">hopefully that it's the default. Because this</span> <span data-start="52.44" data-end="54.9">is going to make our users happy, our developers happy.</span> <span data-start="54.9" data-end="57.45">And happy developers will make better user experiences</span> <span data-start="57.45" data-end="59.47">in the long run.</span> <span data-start="59.47" data-end="62.307">So with these four general goals in mind,</span> <span data-start="62.307" data-end="64.14">I'm going to walk through several techniques</span> <span data-start="64.14" data-end="66.97">for leveraging asynchronous programming for building better</span> <span data-start="66.97" data-end="68.31">UIs.</span> <span data-start="68.31" data-end="69.96">So we're going to look at batching work</span> <span data-start="69.96" data-end="72.54">for better performance and developer experience,</span> <span data-start="72.54" data-end="75.84">keeping our UIs responsive with non-blocking rendering,</span> <span data-start="75.84" data-end="78.63">managing async state for a better user</span> <span data-start="78.63" data-end="82.29">experience and developer experience, and then finally,</span> <span data-start="82.29" data-end="85.53">coordinating async UIs once we have all this asynchronicity</span> <span data-start="85.53" data-end="87.394">throughout our application.</span> <span data-start="87.394" data-end="89.81">And this makes for a handy little talk outline right here.</span> <span data-start="89.81" data-end="91.38">So I'm going to give some background</span> <span data-start="91.38" data-end="93.67">and then jump right into it.</span> <span data-start="93.67" data-end="95.01">But first, a quick note.</span> <span data-start="95.01" data-end="96.39">This is day two of the Dev Summit</span> <span data-start="96.39" data-end="99.9">so it's a little more future forward looking.</span> <span data-start="99.9" data-end="103.44">And the stuff I've made here, the demos and helper code</span> <span data-start="103.44" data-end="105.39">is a little bit experimental.</span> <span data-start="105.39" data-end="108.2">But it's only using current browser features,</span> <span data-start="108.2" data-end="112.14">and so all of these techniques still work today.</span> <span data-start="112.14" data-end="114.63">So now for a little background.</span> <span data-start="114.63" data-end="117.3">I mentioned that I work on web components and lit-html,</span> <span data-start="117.3" data-end="120.15">so we're going to use these things as the basis</span> <span data-start="120.15" data-end="123.27">for the demos in the talk.</span> <span data-start="123.27" data-end="125.82">So if you haven't used web components before,</span> <span data-start="125.82" data-end="130.169">Web Components lets you define your own HTML element tags.</span> <span data-start="130.169" data-end="132.81">So it really refers to two specs here,</span> <span data-start="132.81" data-end="135.052">custom elements and Shadow DOM.</span> <span data-start="135.052" data-end="137.01">And combined, they let you define your own tags</span> <span data-start="137.01" data-end="139.622">with custom implementation and UI.</span> <span data-start="139.622" data-end="141.33">So to create a custom element, you simply</span> <span data-start="141.33" data-end="144.48">extend from HTML element, a built in class,</span> <span data-start="144.48" data-end="146.73">you add your implementation, and then you</span> <span data-start="146.73" data-end="148.62">register your class with a specific tag</span> <span data-start="148.62" data-end="149.652">name with the browser.</span> <span data-start="149.652" data-end="151.86">And from there, you can use this element and that tag</span> <span data-start="151.86" data-end="155.34">name anywhere you can use HTML, so in your main page document,</span> <span data-start="155.34" data-end="158.58">inner HTML, document create element,</span> <span data-start="158.58" data-end="161.52">even in other frameworks.</span> <span data-start="161.52" data-end="164.67">So next, lit-html, lit-html is a way</span> <span data-start="164.67" data-end="168.56">to write declarative HTML templates in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="168.56" data-end="171.33">And we use tagged template literals to write them.</span> <span data-start="171.33" data-end="174.28">This is a feature that came out in ES 6.</span> <span data-start="174.28" data-end="177">And these are strings that are denoted with backticks instead</span> <span data-start="177" data-end="180.551">of quotes, and they can have a template tag in front of them.</span> <span data-start="180.551" data-end="182.8">And we're going to use the lit-html template tag here,</span> <span data-start="182.8" data-end="185.133">which is just going to allow us to process this template</span> <span data-start="185.133" data-end="186.515">to make it more efficient.</span> <span data-start="186.515" data-end="188.89">And then inside of our template, we can have expressions.</span> <span data-start="188.89" data-end="191.277">And these are just plain JavaScript expressions.</span> <span data-start="191.277" data-end="193.86">Once you have a template, if you want to render it to the DOM,</span> <span data-start="193.86" data-end="196.83">you simply pass it to the lit-html render function</span> <span data-start="196.83" data-end="198.54">and give it a node to render to.</span> <span data-start="198.54" data-end="201.182">And it's going to make that DOM appear there.</span> <span data-start="201.182" data-end="203.64">And the nice thing is that if you call this render function</span> <span data-start="203.64" data-end="206.39">multiple times at the same template but different data,</span> <span data-start="206.39" data-end="209.25">lit-html is going to take care to only update</span> <span data-start="209.25" data-end="210.6">the expressions that changed.</span> <span data-start="210.6" data-end="214.767">It will never update the rest of the DOM in the template.</span> <span data-start="214.767" data-end="216.6">And then finally, if you take web components</span> <span data-start="216.6" data-end="218.38">and lit-html and combine them together,</span> <span data-start="218.38" data-end="220.3">you end up with LitElement.</span> <span data-start="220.3" data-end="224.264">So LitElement is a convenient way to write web components.</span> <span data-start="224.264" data-end="226.68">Because this is day two and a little more forward looking,</span> <span data-start="226.68" data-end="229.29">I'm using some future JavaScript features here</span> <span data-start="229.29" data-end="231.86">like decorators and class fields.</span> <span data-start="231.86" data-end="234.55">And LitElement really gives you two features.</span> <span data-start="234.55" data-end="237.52">One is the ability to declare observable properties.</span> <span data-start="237.52" data-end="239.82">So these decorators here are going</span> <span data-start="239.82" data-end="242.797">to create getters and setters instead of a field here.</span> <span data-start="242.797" data-end="244.38">And the setters are going to recognize</span> <span data-start="244.38" data-end="246.546">when this property changes and then tell the element</span> <span data-start="246.546" data-end="248.31">that it needs to update.</span> <span data-start="248.31" data-end="249.72">The other feature is that it lets</span> <span data-start="249.72" data-end="253.65">you write a render method that returns a lit-html result.</span> <span data-start="253.65" data-end="256.07">And so when the element knows that it needs to update,</span> <span data-start="256.07" data-end="258.319">it's going to call this render method, take the result</span> <span data-start="258.319" data-end="261.465">and render it to the shadow root of this custom element.</span> <span data-start="261.465" data-end="263.59">And then finally, we give you a little helper here,</span> <span data-start="263.59" data-end="266.639">so you can use a decorator to register the element.</span> <span data-start="266.639" data-end="268.68">So once you do that, and you create your element,</span> <span data-start="268.68" data-end="271.08">then you can use it anywhere you would HTML,</span> <span data-start="271.08" data-end="274.004">and it will render as you expect.</span> <span data-start="274.004" data-end="275.67">So that brings us to our first technique</span> <span data-start="275.67" data-end="278.04">here, which is batching work.</span> <span data-start="278.04" data-end="280.35">And if we go back to our element definition,</span> <span data-start="280.35" data-end="283.8">you'll see that in the render method here</span> <span data-start="283.8" data-end="286.62">this is called for us automatically by the LitElement</span> <span data-start="286.62" data-end="288">base class.</span> <span data-start="288" data-end="289.86">But the question that comes up here</span> <span data-start="289.86" data-end="292.01">is, when is this method called?</span> <span data-start="292.01" data-end="295.8">So to look at that, let's take a look at a little example here.</span> <span data-start="295.8" data-end="298.14">We're going to use this element imperatively,</span> <span data-start="298.14" data-end="300.98">but this also applies if you used it in the main HTML</span> <span data-start="300.98" data-end="302.62">or if you used it with a framework.</span> <span data-start="302.62" data-end="304.59">So we're going to create an element instance,</span> <span data-start="304.59" data-end="306.6">and then we're going to set a property.</span> <span data-start="306.6" data-end="310.42">So the question is, should we render now?</span> <span data-start="310.42" data-end="311.254">We could render now.</span> <span data-start="311.254" data-end="312.836">But we don't know that we're not going</span> <span data-start="312.836" data-end="314.56">to set another property right after we</span> <span data-start="314.56" data-end="316.88">set this property here.</span> <span data-start="316.88" data-end="319.18">And if we did render after every property set,</span> <span data-start="319.18" data-end="321.37">we would be rendering multiple times potentially</span> <span data-start="321.37" data-end="323.519">for every element as we update the data.</span> <span data-start="323.519" data-end="324.56">We don't want to do that.</span> <span data-start="324.56" data-end="327.65">So instead, we're going to enqueue a task.</span> <span data-start="327.65" data-end="329.11">And then, in the future, that task</span> <span data-start="329.11" data-end="331.629">is going to run and actually render that element.</span> <span data-start="331.629" data-end="333.67">And so that we know when the element has rendered</span> <span data-start="333.67" data-end="337.84">and when it's complete, we add this promise hanging off</span> <span data-start="337.84" data-end="339.912">the element here called update complete.</span> <span data-start="339.912" data-end="342.37">And this is going to resolve when the element has rendered.</span> <span data-start="342.37" data-end="344.078">And if you wait for it, you know that you</span> <span data-start="344.078" data-end="346.306">have a fully rendered element.</span> <span data-start="346.306" data-end="347.68">And the way that this works is we</span> <span data-start="347.68" data-end="349.96">have an asynchronous update pipeline</span> <span data-start="349.96" data-end="351.65">under the hood in the element.</span> <span data-start="351.65" data-end="353.59">So when a setter is called for a property,</span> <span data-start="353.59" data-end="356.08">it's going to call this request update method.</span> <span data-start="356.08" data-end="357.982">That's going to schedule an update task,</span> <span data-start="357.982" data-end="359.44">but it's only going to schedule one</span> <span data-start="359.44" data-end="360.737">if there isn't one existing.</span> <span data-start="360.737" data-end="363.07">If there is one, we're just going to use that same task,</span> <span data-start="363.07" data-end="364.535">and that's how we get the batching.</span> <span data-start="364.535" data-end="366.91">When that task runs, it's going to call the update method</span> <span data-start="366.91" data-end="367.81">on the element.</span> <span data-start="367.81" data-end="372.56">And that's where the actual work is done to render to the DOM.</span> <span data-start="372.56" data-end="373.92">So we do this for two reasons.</span> <span data-start="373.92" data-end="375.8">One is performance, like I mentioned.</span> <span data-start="375.8" data-end="377.82">And the other is developer ergonomics.</span> <span data-start="377.82" data-end="379.82">So if we go back to the template here,</span> <span data-start="379.82" data-end="381.32">we see that this template renders</span> <span data-start="381.32" data-end="383.684">two different properties in the same template.</span> <span data-start="383.684" data-end="385.85">And it's much easier to reason about these templates</span> <span data-start="385.85" data-end="388.31">if we don't have to worry about the order in which</span> <span data-start="388.31" data-end="390.86">these properties are set or whether or not they've both</span> <span data-start="390.86" data-end="392.3">been set together or not.</span> <span data-start="392.3" data-end="394.49">So we'd like to take all the changes that</span> <span data-start="394.49" data-end="397.01">are incoming for an element, batch them together, and then</span> <span data-start="397.01" data-end="399.218">let you write a simple declarative template to render</span> <span data-start="399.218" data-end="401.212">your element.</span> <span data-start="401.212" data-end="402.92">And so an interesting implication of this</span> <span data-start="402.92" data-end="406.67">is that LitElement rendering is always async.</span> <span data-start="406.67" data-end="409.73">You never opt into being async, and you can't opt out</span> <span data-start="409.73" data-end="411.812">to being synchronous.</span> <span data-start="411.812" data-end="413.27">And when we explain this to people,</span> <span data-start="413.27" data-end="417.11">sometimes, we get a question, won't the UI partially update?</span> <span data-start="417.11" data-end="418.56">And the answer is no.</span> <span data-start="418.56" data-end="421.2">And I built a little animation here to try to show this.</span> <span data-start="421.2" data-end="423.154">So here, we have a tree of elements.</span> <span data-start="423.154" data-end="424.82">Let's assume these are all lit elements,</span> <span data-start="424.82" data-end="428.545">and they're passing data down the tree via properties.</span> <span data-start="428.545" data-end="429.92">And so that's our component tree.</span> <span data-start="429.92" data-end="432.2">And then right here, we have the microtask queue.</span> <span data-start="432.2" data-end="434.45">So hopefully in other talks they've talked about this.</span> <span data-start="434.45" data-end="436.94">We have a queue of microtasks that the browser</span> <span data-start="436.94" data-end="440.57">runs through to completion before it will paint or handle</span> <span data-start="440.57" data-end="442.13">user input.</span> <span data-start="442.13" data-end="445.17">The yellow box here is our current microtask.</span> <span data-start="445.17" data-end="446.87">And so if we have some code that runs</span> <span data-start="446.87" data-end="448.67">that's going to set a property on A,</span> <span data-start="448.67" data-end="451.935">that's going to cause its microtask to be enqueued.</span> <span data-start="451.935" data-end="454.31">And then when A gets to run, it might set some properties</span> <span data-start="454.31" data-end="457.16">on B and C. So their tasks are going to be enqueued.</span> <span data-start="457.16" data-end="459.02">And B is going to set some properties on D</span> <span data-start="459.02" data-end="462.56">and E. C is going to set some on F and so forth.</span> <span data-start="462.56" data-end="466.64">And we get to run through this entire queue until it's empty.</span> <span data-start="466.64" data-end="470.16">Once it's empty, then the browser can paint.</span> <span data-start="470.16" data-end="473.3">And to show this with a demo, I made a demo</span> <span data-start="473.3" data-end="475.337">here of a tree of elements.</span> <span data-start="475.337" data-end="477.17">And each one takes an artificially long time</span> <span data-start="477.17" data-end="478.2">to render.</span> <span data-start="478.2" data-end="481.591">And so normally, you might expect,</span> <span data-start="481.591" data-end="483.59">if you don't know how the microtask queue works,</span> <span data-start="483.59" data-end="485.68">that these might paint in individually.</span> <span data-start="485.68" data-end="488.81">And we'll see here that if we click the render button here,</span> <span data-start="488.81" data-end="490.49">that they all snap in at once.</span> <span data-start="490.49" data-end="492.38">So even though each one takes 50 milliseconds</span> <span data-start="492.38" data-end="494.9">and the whole thing takes 750 milliseconds,</span> <span data-start="494.9" data-end="497.47">we don't see the intermediate states.</span> <span data-start="497.47" data-end="500.69">And this is great if your UI is painting fast, if it's not</span> <span data-start="500.69" data-end="503.27">taking 750 milliseconds.</span> <span data-start="503.27" data-end="505.79">But if you have a very complex tree</span> <span data-start="505.79" data-end="507.86">and UI is rendering slowly, then we've</span> <span data-start="507.86" data-end="510.84">just introduced jank, which we don't want.</span> <span data-start="510.84" data-end="512.75">So this brings us to the next technique,</span> <span data-start="512.75" data-end="517.34">which is non-blocking rendering to keep a responsive UI.</span> <span data-start="517.34" data-end="519.64">So we just saw that we can have async rendering,</span> <span data-start="519.64" data-end="521.123">but still block paint and input.</span> <span data-start="521.123" data-end="522.789">And we know we can have complex UIs that</span> <span data-start="522.789" data-end="524.034">take a long time to render.</span> <span data-start="524.034" data-end="526.45">And we know we need to render in less than 10 milliseconds</span> <span data-start="526.45" data-end="530.537">to keep our 60 frame per second target.</span> <span data-start="530.537" data-end="532.12">And one way to look at this is that we</span> <span data-start="532.12" data-end="535.36">have all these microtasks here in the blue rectangles,</span> <span data-start="535.36" data-end="537.46">and they fill out a complete task.</span> <span data-start="537.46" data-end="539.35">And this task blocks rendering.</span> <span data-start="539.35" data-end="542.91">And as long as the complete task fits within our 10</span> <span data-start="542.91" data-end="544.75">millisecond budget, we're fine.</span> <span data-start="544.75" data-end="545.57">Right?</span> <span data-start="545.57" data-end="547.67">But as soon as the task exceeds the budget,</span> <span data-start="547.67" data-end="549.01">we're going to introduce jank.</span> <span data-start="549.01" data-end="551.752">So our technique here is to break this up.</span> <span data-start="551.752" data-end="553.96">So that instead of having a whole bunch of microtasks</span> <span data-start="553.96" data-end="558.25">in one long task, we just give a task per component to render.</span> <span data-start="558.25" data-end="561.05">And now, these will hopefully fit in under 10 milliseconds.</span> <span data-start="561.05" data-end="563.48">And we will get smooth updates.</span> <span data-start="563.48" data-end="565.54">So the way we're going to do this is we're</span> <span data-start="565.54" data-end="568.36">going to tap into this asynchronous update pipeline</span> <span data-start="568.36" data-end="569.77">that LitElement has.</span> <span data-start="569.77" data-end="572.12">And we're going to customize the schedule update task</span> <span data-start="572.12" data-end="573.89">step right here.</span> <span data-start="573.89" data-end="576.34">So that brings us to our first experimental helper</span> <span data-start="576.34" data-end="579.94">that we're calling for the moment LazyLitElement.</span> <span data-start="579.94" data-end="583.36">The way this works is that under the hood in LitElement,</span> <span data-start="583.36" data-end="585.46">there's a method called scheduleUpdate.</span> <span data-start="585.46" data-end="588.28">And by default, this thing just waits for a microtask,</span> <span data-start="588.28" data-end="589.93">and then it calls validate, which</span> <span data-start="589.93" data-end="592.132">does the work of rendering.</span> <span data-start="592.132" data-end="593.59">And so what we do in LazyLitElement</span> <span data-start="593.59" data-end="594.49">is we override this.</span> <span data-start="594.49" data-end="596.59">And instead of waiting for a microtask,</span> <span data-start="596.59" data-end="599.807">we wait for a promise that's resolved on setTimeout timing.</span> <span data-start="599.807" data-end="601.39">It's a very simple thing to do, but it</span> <span data-start="601.39" data-end="605.355">lets the browser paint and handle input before we render.</span> <span data-start="605.355" data-end="606.98">So now if we go back to this demo here,</span> <span data-start="606.98" data-end="609.59">we can turn on lazy rendering.</span> <span data-start="609.59" data-end="612.62">And now, everything is going to render on setTimeout timing.</span> <span data-start="612.62" data-end="615.47">And you can see that we paint the intermediate steps here</span> <span data-start="615.47" data-end="616.46">as we go.</span> <span data-start="616.46" data-end="619.31">And so we've reduced jank by showing</span> <span data-start="619.31" data-end="621.77">some intermediate state.</span> <span data-start="621.77" data-end="623.27">And so a lot of frameworks have been</span> <span data-start="623.27" data-end="626.51">working on asynchronous rendering over the years,</span> <span data-start="626.51" data-end="629.12">and especially React recently.</span> <span data-start="629.12" data-end="631.25">And they have created a demo that I quite like,</span> <span data-start="631.25" data-end="634.04">which is a Sierpinski triangle demo.</span> <span data-start="634.04" data-end="636.56">And the way this works is that you have a large tree</span> <span data-start="636.56" data-end="637.502">of components here.</span> <span data-start="637.502" data-end="638.96">And each one of these has also been</span> <span data-start="638.96" data-end="641.627">written to take an artificially long amount of time,</span> <span data-start="641.627" data-end="642.71">and they all have a label.</span> <span data-start="642.71" data-end="645.346">And this label represents data flowing down the tree.</span> <span data-start="645.346" data-end="647.22">So to update the label on all the components,</span> <span data-start="647.22" data-end="649.22">it's going to take a little bit of time.</span> <span data-start="649.22" data-end="650.96">And while we're updating the label,</span> <span data-start="650.96" data-end="652.91">we're going to animate the size of the tree.</span> <span data-start="652.91" data-end="654.98">And we want this animation to be smooth,</span> <span data-start="654.98" data-end="656.39">and it's driven from JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="656.39" data-end="658.73">So if we take a long time to update the tree,</span> <span data-start="658.73" data-end="660.47">we're going to get jank.</span> <span data-start="660.47" data-end="662.527">This is a nice demo because it highlights</span> <span data-start="662.527" data-end="664.61">some subtleties that you need to take care of when</span> <span data-start="664.61" data-end="666.24">doing asynchronous rendering.</span> <span data-start="666.24" data-end="668.27">So we have an expensive subtree to render.</span> <span data-start="668.27" data-end="671.242">We want this continuous script driven animation to be smooth.</span> <span data-start="671.242" data-end="673.7">And then on top of that, we have these high priority inputs</span> <span data-start="673.7" data-end="675.71">that we also want to handle.</span> <span data-start="675.71" data-end="678.08">So I implemented this here with regular Element</span> <span data-start="678.08" data-end="680">that uses the microtask queue.</span> <span data-start="680" data-end="683.21">And you can see that as the triangle updates in size,</span> <span data-start="683.21" data-end="685.24">we get some jank in the middle there.</span> <span data-start="685.24" data-end="686.91">And we want to avoid that.</span> <span data-start="686.91" data-end="689.12">So it's very simple to re implement this just</span> <span data-start="689.12" data-end="691.43">by changing the base class to LazyLitElement.</span> <span data-start="691.43" data-end="694.91">And now you can see that we get a smooth animation even</span> <span data-start="694.91" data-end="697.886">as we update the labels here.</span> <span data-start="697.886" data-end="700.26">But next, I mentioned we want to have these high priority</span> <span data-start="700.26" data-end="701.22">inputs.</span> <span data-start="701.22" data-end="704.25">So this brings us to the idea of urgent updates.</span> <span data-start="704.25" data-end="706.464">If you defer rendering, it's possible</span> <span data-start="706.464" data-end="707.88">that you have situations where you</span> <span data-start="707.88" data-end="710.046">want to render sooner than you've scheduled yourself</span> <span data-start="710.046" data-end="711.73">to be rendered.</span> <span data-start="711.73" data-end="714.6">And so with these urgent updates what we've done</span> <span data-start="714.6" data-end="716.66">is we've created in LazyLitElement,</span> <span data-start="716.66" data-end="719.22">we don't just override the schedule update method.</span> <span data-start="719.22" data-end="722.3">We add a new method on here called requestUrgentUpdate.</span> <span data-start="722.3" data-end="725.49">And that's going to be called and make your element</span> <span data-start="725.49" data-end="727.974">render sooner.</span> <span data-start="727.974" data-end="729.39">It's a very simple implementation.</span> <span data-start="729.39" data-end="731.848">I wanted to show it, because it's a little bit interesting.</span> <span data-start="731.848" data-end="734.1">So instead of waiting for a promise that resolves with</span> <span data-start="734.1" data-end="738.88">setTimeout —  we still do that, but we also store — </span> <span data-start="738.88" data-end="740.93">Let me go back here.</span> <span data-start="740.93" data-end="741.43">Maybe not.</span> <span data-start="741.43" data-end="741.929">OK.</span> <span data-start="741.929" data-end="746.05">Well, we restore the resolve function</span> <span data-start="746.05" data-end="750.82">on the instance of the element when we schedule an update.</span> <span data-start="750.82" data-end="755.27">And then we can go back and we can call that resolve function,</span> <span data-start="755.27" data-end="757.249">which will cause our promise to resolve earlier</span> <span data-start="757.249" data-end="758.29">than it was scheduled to.</span> <span data-start="758.29" data-end="760.637">So in essence, we're jumping from the task queue</span> <span data-start="760.637" data-end="762.47">over to the microtask queue, and we're going</span> <span data-start="762.47" data-end="763.72">to render as soon as possible.</span> <span data-start="766.76" data-end="768.35">OK, so this is how you would use it.</span> <span data-start="768.35" data-end="769.96">So we have a partial implementation</span> <span data-start="769.96" data-end="772.89">of our DotElement here.</span> <span data-start="772.89" data-end="774.55">And these are some event callbacks</span> <span data-start="774.55" data-end="777.655">that might be called from on mouse over and on mouse out.</span> <span data-start="777.655" data-end="780.28">And they're simply going to set the state that our rendering is</span> <span data-start="780.28" data-end="782.05">based on, and then they're going to call</span> <span data-start="782.05" data-end="786.5">requestUrgentUpdate to kick us to the faster timing.</span> <span data-start="786.5" data-end="789.577">And so once we do that, you can see that we</span> <span data-start="789.577" data-end="790.66">have our smooth animation.</span> <span data-start="790.66" data-end="791.83">Our labels update.</span> <span data-start="791.83" data-end="793.45">And we get a fast hover over effect</span> <span data-start="793.45" data-end="797.99">here by calling requestUrgentUpdate.</span> <span data-start="797.99" data-end="800.03">And let me talk real quick about scheduling.</span> <span data-start="800.03" data-end="803.21">So in that demo there I did a very simple thing.</span> <span data-start="803.21" data-end="804.8">I said instead of using a microtask,</span> <span data-start="804.8" data-end="807.29">we're going to use a full task.</span> <span data-start="807.29" data-end="809.296">And I actually didn't expect that to work</span> <span data-start="809.296" data-end="810.92">as well as it did when I made the demo,</span> <span data-start="810.92" data-end="812.39">but it did work very well.</span> <span data-start="812.39" data-end="814.76">The browser ends up doing a very good job</span> <span data-start="814.76" data-end="817.43">of executing as many tasks as it can</span> <span data-start="817.43" data-end="819.634">before it has to paint a frame.</span> <span data-start="819.634" data-end="822.05">But it's pretty naive, and it leaves off a lot of features</span> <span data-start="822.05" data-end="824.81">that we would like, like different priority queues,</span> <span data-start="824.81" data-end="827.99">the ability to cancel work, the ability to coordinate</span> <span data-start="827.99" data-end="831.32">long chains of tasks that are all related together.</span> <span data-start="831.32" data-end="833.66">So that schedule update method is exactly where</span> <span data-start="833.66" data-end="837.39">we would like to plug into a native platform scheduler API,</span> <span data-start="837.39" data-end="840.17">like Shubhie and Jason talked about earlier.</span> <span data-start="840.17" data-end="842.31">So the important point is that with web components,</span> <span data-start="842.31" data-end="845.66">we don't have a overarching framework that can coordinate</span> <span data-start="845.66" data-end="847.43">and schedule our components for us,</span> <span data-start="847.43" data-end="849.98">and we might get components from different vendors.</span> <span data-start="849.98" data-end="852.74">So being able to plug into a global platform</span> <span data-start="852.74" data-end="855.51">vendored API for scheduling is going to help us tremendously</span> <span data-start="855.51" data-end="856.01">here.</span> <span data-start="860.23" data-end="861.22">OK, there we go.</span> <span data-start="861.22" data-end="864.35">Let's move on to talking about managing async state.</span> <span data-start="864.35" data-end="867.87">So far we've talked about being asynchronous on a per component</span> <span data-start="867.87" data-end="869.58">level, so yielding to the browser</span> <span data-start="869.58" data-end="872.37">and letting it paint in between components.</span> <span data-start="872.37" data-end="873.99">But sometimes, we need to manage data</span> <span data-start="873.99" data-end="875.82">that itself is asynchronous.</span> <span data-start="875.82" data-end="878.246">And lit-html rendering is synchronous by nature.</span> <span data-start="878.246" data-end="880.12">When you give the render function a template,</span> <span data-start="880.12" data-end="882.867">it's going to do all the work immediately to render that.</span> <span data-start="882.867" data-end="885.45">So what do we do if we want to render asynchronous data inside</span> <span data-start="885.45" data-end="888.1">of a synchronous template?</span> <span data-start="888.1" data-end="890.65">So we can look at how we handle data normally here.</span> <span data-start="890.65" data-end="893.76">And if we have a string and just a plain reference</span> <span data-start="893.76" data-end="896.401">to that string, it's pretty easy to use.</span> <span data-start="896.401" data-end="898.65">We just use it as a template, and we get the rendering</span> <span data-start="898.65" data-end="901.21">that we wanted.</span> <span data-start="901.21" data-end="905.95">And if we change this instead to load off the network,</span> <span data-start="905.95" data-end="909.28">it turns out that lit-html handles promises already.</span> <span data-start="909.28" data-end="911.722">And so what we'll get is a blank screen here.</span> <span data-start="911.722" data-end="913.18">And then when the promise resolves,</span> <span data-start="913.18" data-end="914.86">we'll render hello world.</span> <span data-start="914.86" data-end="915.89">So this is kind of nice.</span> <span data-start="915.89" data-end="917.306">We get some behavior that we might</span> <span data-start="917.306" data-end="919.97">expect right out of the box.</span> <span data-start="919.97" data-end="922.6">But we might not want to render a blank screen</span> <span data-start="922.6" data-end="924.17">as our initial state.</span> <span data-start="924.17" data-end="926.82">So this brings us to the idea of directives,</span> <span data-start="926.82" data-end="929.509">and these are functions that are a little bit special</span> <span data-start="929.509" data-end="931.3">and they're able to customize how templates</span> <span data-start="931.3" data-end="933.209">are rendered by lit-html.</span> <span data-start="933.209" data-end="934.75">And one of the more useful directives</span> <span data-start="934.75" data-end="937.95">that lit-html ships with is called until.</span> <span data-start="937.95" data-end="940.12">What until does is it takes a promise</span> <span data-start="940.12" data-end="942.79">and it will render the result of that promise when it resolves,</span> <span data-start="942.79" data-end="945.37">but it will render a placeholder until that promise does</span> <span data-start="945.37" data-end="946.96">resolve.</span> <span data-start="946.96" data-end="948.92">So we can use that here.</span> <span data-start="948.92" data-end="950.71">And you see that in the template,</span> <span data-start="950.71" data-end="954.46">we call the until directive with our promise in the loading</span> <span data-start="954.46" data-end="955.18">place holder.</span> <span data-start="955.18" data-end="956.68">And that's going to show first.</span> <span data-start="956.68" data-end="958.27">And then when it resolves, we're going</span> <span data-start="958.27" data-end="961.069">to render our content there.</span> <span data-start="961.069" data-end="962.86">So this example is a little bit too simple,</span> <span data-start="962.86" data-end="965.443">because it assumes that we have this promise available already</span> <span data-start="965.443" data-end="966.67">that we want to use.</span> <span data-start="966.67" data-end="969.16">And a lot of times, instead, we want</span> <span data-start="969.16" data-end="972.04">to run some tasks when we need to render.</span> <span data-start="972.04" data-end="973.9">And we might have some operation that's</span> <span data-start="973.9" data-end="976.37">dependent on some instant state.</span> <span data-start="976.37" data-end="978.28">So in this version of the example here,</span> <span data-start="978.28" data-end="979.81">we have a file name property.</span> <span data-start="979.81" data-end="982.88">And we want to fetch some data based on that file name.</span> <span data-start="982.88" data-end="984.84">Now we might be tempted to call fetch</span> <span data-start="984.84" data-end="987.04">in line with the template, so that we'll</span> <span data-start="987.04" data-end="990.32">fetch the correct file and then render it.</span> <span data-start="990.32" data-end="994.54">And this does work, but it has a problem where every time you</span> <span data-start="994.54" data-end="996.73">render this template, we're going to call fetch.</span> <span data-start="996.73" data-end="998.313">And we might be rendering the template</span> <span data-start="998.313" data-end="1000.11">because some other properties change.</span> <span data-start="1000.11" data-end="1002.193">And in this case, we're going to flood the network</span> <span data-start="1002.193" data-end="1003.81">with lots of fetch requests.</span> <span data-start="1003.81" data-end="1006.72">And we also might show an alternating loading</span> <span data-start="1006.72" data-end="1010.55">and resolved state in our UI.</span> <span data-start="1010.55" data-end="1012.9">But it's almost the mental model that we want.</span> <span data-start="1012.9" data-end="1014.19">Right?</span> <span data-start="1014.19" data-end="1016.35">So what we really want to do is we</span> <span data-start="1016.35" data-end="1020.79">want to be able to run a task that's dependent on some data</span> <span data-start="1020.79" data-end="1022.33">only when that data changes.</span> <span data-start="1022.33" data-end="1024.69">So that brings us to the next experimental helper</span> <span data-start="1024.69" data-end="1027.9">here that we call runAsync.</span> <span data-start="1027.9" data-end="1030.66">And what runAsync does is it performs an async operation,</span> <span data-start="1030.66" data-end="1033.369">but only when the data it depends on changes.</span> <span data-start="1033.369" data-end="1036.175">And it's actually a directive factory.</span> <span data-start="1036.175" data-end="1037.8">So the way it works is that you give it</span> <span data-start="1037.8" data-end="1040.14">in async function that takes some data</span> <span data-start="1040.14" data-end="1042.15">and produces a result, and it returns to you</span> <span data-start="1042.15" data-end="1045.88">a directive that you can use inside your lit-html template.</span> <span data-start="1045.88" data-end="1050.37">So if we want to reproduce the previous example here using</span> <span data-start="1050.37" data-end="1053.97">this fetch, we can just create a fetch content directive</span> <span data-start="1053.97" data-end="1056.98">by passing runAsync a function that takes a file name</span> <span data-start="1056.98" data-end="1060.089">and calls fetch for us.</span> <span data-start="1060.089" data-end="1061.63">And when we go to use it, we can just</span> <span data-start="1061.63" data-end="1063.13">use it inside of our template.</span> <span data-start="1063.13" data-end="1065.65">And we pass it the file name here,</span> <span data-start="1065.65" data-end="1067.69">and then we pass it another template that's</span> <span data-start="1067.69" data-end="1070.27">going to render when we have successfully</span> <span data-start="1070.27" data-end="1072.35">resolved that promise.</span> <span data-start="1072.35" data-end="1076.78">So this lets us get part of the way to our goal here.</span> <span data-start="1076.78" data-end="1078.91">We can render some asynchronous data,</span> <span data-start="1078.91" data-end="1080.71">but it turns out that asynchronous data</span> <span data-start="1080.71" data-end="1083.74">can be in a number of different states.</span> <span data-start="1083.74" data-end="1087.22">For any async operation, you can be in initial state, which</span> <span data-start="1087.22" data-end="1088.51">means you haven't started it.</span> <span data-start="1088.51" data-end="1089.95">You can be pending.</span> <span data-start="1089.95" data-end="1093.26">It can have successfully completed or ended in failure.</span> <span data-start="1093.26" data-end="1095.23">And so it really helps us if we model and think</span> <span data-start="1095.23" data-end="1097.63">about all of these states explicitly,</span> <span data-start="1097.63" data-end="1099.377">so that we make sure we handle them.</span> <span data-start="1099.377" data-end="1100.96">We can see that our directive actually</span> <span data-start="1100.96" data-end="1104.14">takes templates for all of the different states</span> <span data-start="1104.14" data-end="1105.13">that our UI can be in.</span> <span data-start="1105.13" data-end="1108.04">So we have a success template, a pending template,</span> <span data-start="1108.04" data-end="1111.15">a initial state template, and an error template.</span> <span data-start="1111.15" data-end="1113.3">And to make this a little bit more realistic,</span> <span data-start="1113.3" data-end="1117.35">I made a demo that searches the NPM package repository.</span> <span data-start="1117.35" data-end="1118.96">And this is a basic search as you</span> <span data-start="1118.96" data-end="1121.51">type live search result demo.</span> <span data-start="1121.51" data-end="1122.65">And it has a simple UI.</span> <span data-start="1122.65" data-end="1125.72">We just have a search box and a results panel down here.</span> <span data-start="1125.72" data-end="1129.13">OK, so we're going to build this demo in two parts, hopefully.</span> <span data-start="1129.13" data-end="1131.71">So first, we're going to define a searchPackages directive</span> <span data-start="1131.71" data-end="1133.63">using runAsync.</span> <span data-start="1133.63" data-end="1135.52">And so here's our initial starting point</span> <span data-start="1135.52" data-end="1136.87">for this directive.</span> <span data-start="1136.87" data-end="1139.39">Our async task function here is going</span> <span data-start="1139.39" data-end="1143.95">to generate a URL for the NPM search service</span> <span data-start="1143.95" data-end="1146.979">here and then get the results by fetching it.</span> <span data-start="1146.979" data-end="1149.02">And then here, we're going to handle the response</span> <span data-start="1149.02" data-end="1150.88">and just do a little bit of due diligence</span> <span data-start="1150.88" data-end="1154.3">and make sure that we have a 200 response and return that.</span> <span data-start="1154.3" data-end="1158.47">Otherwise, we throw the message we got back.</span> <span data-start="1158.47" data-end="1162.28">And I wanted to make this task able to trigger</span> <span data-start="1162.28" data-end="1164.34">that initial state template.</span> <span data-start="1164.34" data-end="1168.98">And the way we do that in runAsync, we</span> <span data-start="1168.98" data-end="1170.5">throw an initial state error.</span> <span data-start="1170.5" data-end="1171.94">So here, I'm just going to check to make sure we</span> <span data-start="1171.94" data-end="1173.19">have a query we can execute.</span> <span data-start="1173.19" data-end="1174.94">And if not, I'm going to throw this error.</span> <span data-start="1174.94" data-end="1179.47">And runAsync is going to render the initial state template.</span> <span data-start="1179.47" data-end="1181.36">And then it turns out that the NPM registry</span> <span data-start="1181.36" data-end="1183.82">is a little difficult to get it to trigger an error.</span> <span data-start="1183.82" data-end="1185.87">Usually, it just returns empty results.</span> <span data-start="1185.87" data-end="1188.44">So to be able to show the error state template,</span> <span data-start="1188.44" data-end="1190.48">I just do some prevalidation here of the query</span> <span data-start="1190.48" data-end="1193.09">and make sure we don't start with the dot or underscore.</span> <span data-start="1193.09" data-end="1196.33">And then finally, to make this even more realistic, if you're</span> <span data-start="1196.33" data-end="1198.462">doing a search as you type UI, you're</span> <span data-start="1198.462" data-end="1200.92">going to have a lot of requests that you initiate where you</span> <span data-start="1200.92" data-end="1203.32">don't care about the results, because you've</span> <span data-start="1203.32" data-end="1207.18">typed in a different query by the time the result gets back.</span> <span data-start="1207.18" data-end="1208.93">So the fetch API is able to take something</span> <span data-start="1208.93" data-end="1211.84">called an abort signal, so that we can cancel the request.</span> <span data-start="1211.84" data-end="1214.78">And so runAsync will generate an abort signal for you.</span> <span data-start="1214.78" data-end="1217.18">And then you get it in this options argument here</span> <span data-start="1217.18" data-end="1220.6">and you can forward this on to the fetch API.</span> <span data-start="1220.6" data-end="1223.39">And so this is our entire searchPackages directive</span> <span data-start="1223.39" data-end="1226.04">here built with runAsync.</span> <span data-start="1226.04" data-end="1228.25">And so next, we just need to use it.</span> <span data-start="1228.25" data-end="1230.66">Here's a little snippet of the demo UI.</span> <span data-start="1230.66" data-end="1233.66">We have an input element here, which</span> <span data-start="1233.66" data-end="1237.26">just simply displays the query and updates the query on input.</span> <span data-start="1237.26" data-end="1241.43">And then down here, we use the searchPackages directive.</span> <span data-start="1241.43" data-end="1243.364">And so we use it by passing it to query.</span> <span data-start="1243.364" data-end="1245.03">And then, we give it a success template.</span> <span data-start="1245.03" data-end="1246.613">Here, we just iterate over the results</span> <span data-start="1246.613" data-end="1248.4">and display little cards.</span> <span data-start="1248.4" data-end="1251.15">And then we give it the pending, initial,</span> <span data-start="1251.15" data-end="1254.69">and error state templates here.</span> <span data-start="1254.69" data-end="1257.085">And so when we go to use this demo,</span> <span data-start="1257.085" data-end="1259.46">we see that we have the initial state template rendering.</span> <span data-start="1259.46" data-end="1260.36">Sorry that's small.</span> <span data-start="1260.36" data-end="1262.34">It says enter a search term.</span> <span data-start="1262.34" data-end="1264.75">When we type, it turns into loading.</span> <span data-start="1264.75" data-end="1267.11">And then we get our results back.</span> <span data-start="1267.11" data-end="1269.48">And if we were to go back and enter a query that</span> <span data-start="1269.48" data-end="1271.282">starts with an invalid character,</span> <span data-start="1271.282" data-end="1273.74">you're going to see the error template there, and that even</span> <span data-start="1273.74" data-end="1275.84">updates as you type.</span> <span data-start="1275.84" data-end="1277.85">And if you realize your mistake, and go in</span> <span data-start="1277.85" data-end="1279.57">and type in a new term, you're going</span> <span data-start="1279.57" data-end="1283.88">to get all the intermediate async state</span> <span data-start="1283.88" data-end="1285.27">templates as you type.</span> <span data-start="1285.27" data-end="1286.82">So that's the demo, and you really</span> <span data-start="1286.82" data-end="1288.528">did see most of the implementation there.</span> <span data-start="1288.528" data-end="1291.47">So it was quite easy to do with that directive.</span> <span data-start="1291.47" data-end="1292.97">And the key takeaway here is that we</span> <span data-start="1292.97" data-end="1296.87">want to explicitly model our asynchronous operation state.</span> <span data-start="1296.87" data-end="1300.02">If we do that, we're more sure to take care of all the states</span> <span data-start="1300.02" data-end="1301.22">that we can be in.</span> <span data-start="1301.22" data-end="1302.79">And if we build a UI for each state,</span> <span data-start="1302.79" data-end="1304.46">then we're going to accurately let</span> <span data-start="1304.46" data-end="1307.01">our users know what is going on with the application.</span> <span data-start="1307.01" data-end="1310.62">And they're going to have a better user experience.</span> <span data-start="1310.62" data-end="1313.1">OK, so finally, once we have an application</span> <span data-start="1313.1" data-end="1316.3">and a UI built up of all these asynchronous components,</span> <span data-start="1316.3" data-end="1318">we might need to coordinate them.</span> <span data-start="1318" data-end="1318.5">Right?</span> <span data-start="1318.5" data-end="1323.58">So if you have a lot of async children in your page,</span> <span data-start="1323.58" data-end="1326.63">how do we ensure a consistent UI if you want to?</span> <span data-start="1326.63" data-end="1330.23">Or how do we avoid a sea of spinners?</span> <span data-start="1330.23" data-end="1334.61">And so to demonstrate the sea of spinners problem,</span> <span data-start="1334.61" data-end="1337.04">I added to the demo a little feature here</span> <span data-start="1337.04" data-end="1339.27">where when you search, the cards are</span> <span data-start="1339.27" data-end="1341.27">going to do their own query to bring up the disk</span> <span data-start="1341.27" data-end="1343.195">tag of your NPM packages.</span> <span data-start="1343.195" data-end="1345.32">And you can see there that we saw a lot of spinners</span> <span data-start="1345.32" data-end="1348.556">on the page, and this can be a distracting UI.</span> <span data-start="1348.556" data-end="1350.18">So we want to give developers an option</span> <span data-start="1350.18" data-end="1352.947">to not have to deal with the sea of spinners.</span> <span data-start="1352.947" data-end="1354.53">And the way we're going to handle this</span> <span data-start="1354.53" data-end="1356.738">is that we're going to coordinate the components here</span> <span data-start="1356.738" data-end="1357.84">with events.</span> <span data-start="1357.84" data-end="1359.256">So what we're going to do is we're</span> <span data-start="1359.256" data-end="1361.25">going to fire a promise carrying event.</span> <span data-start="1361.25" data-end="1363.78">And that promise is going to resolve when some work is done.</span> <span data-start="1363.78" data-end="1366.26">So an async child component creates a promise,</span> <span data-start="1366.26" data-end="1369.267">fires this event, and then resolves the promise.</span> <span data-start="1369.267" data-end="1370.85">And so that's going to look like this.</span> <span data-start="1370.85" data-end="1373.3">A is going to be our container up there.</span> <span data-start="1373.3" data-end="1374.927">And E and F are our async children.</span> <span data-start="1374.927" data-end="1376.76">And they're going to fire this pending state</span> <span data-start="1376.76" data-end="1379.49">event that holds a promise.</span> <span data-start="1379.49" data-end="1381.32">The container is going to handle the event</span> <span data-start="1381.32" data-end="1382.437">and wait for that promise.</span> <span data-start="1382.437" data-end="1384.27">And then the children when the work is done,</span> <span data-start="1384.27" data-end="1385.811">they're going to resolve the promise.</span> <span data-start="1385.811" data-end="1389.51">And finally, when all the promises have settled,</span> <span data-start="1389.51" data-end="1391.58">we're going to update the UI.</span> <span data-start="1391.58" data-end="1395.96">So that brings us to our last experimental prototype</span> <span data-start="1395.96" data-end="1397.96">here called PendingContainer.</span> <span data-start="1397.96" data-end="1402.41">And PendingContainer takes care of all this plumbing for you.</span> <span data-start="1402.41" data-end="1404.39">And it's a class mix in, so you can apply this</span> <span data-start="1404.39" data-end="1406.55">to a superclass like LitElement.</span> <span data-start="1406.55" data-end="1409.31">And this has two features too.</span> <span data-start="1409.31" data-end="1411.934">We have the has pending children property.</span> <span data-start="1411.934" data-end="1413.6">So this indicates whether or not there's</span> <span data-start="1413.6" data-end="1415.55">async work happening below you.</span> <span data-start="1415.55" data-end="1417.05">And when this property changes, it's</span> <span data-start="1417.05" data-end="1419.324">going to cause a rerender of the element.</span> <span data-start="1419.324" data-end="1420.74">And then we have an event listener</span> <span data-start="1420.74" data-end="1423.2">that listens for the pending state event</span> <span data-start="1423.2" data-end="1424.58">and then triggers the bookkeeping</span> <span data-start="1424.58" data-end="1428.84">so that we know if we have any extra work pending below us.</span> <span data-start="1428.84" data-end="1430.7">And to use it, you can just apply this mix</span> <span data-start="1430.7" data-end="1434.09">in to the superclass here, to LitElement.</span> <span data-start="1434.09" data-end="1436.07">And once you do that, you get available</span> <span data-start="1436.07" data-end="1437.69">the has pending children property that</span> <span data-start="1437.69" data-end="1439.83">can be used in your template.</span> <span data-start="1439.83" data-end="1442.22">And so now we're going to add a spinner,</span> <span data-start="1442.22" data-end="1445.1">and this is a top level spinner, to the UI that's</span> <span data-start="1445.1" data-end="1447.08">triggered based on whether or not</span> <span data-start="1447.08" data-end="1448.74">there's any pending children.</span> <span data-start="1448.74" data-end="1450.61">And so the runAsync helper is going</span> <span data-start="1450.61" data-end="1451.85">to fire these events for us.</span> <span data-start="1451.85" data-end="1454.76">And this container mix in is going to capture them.</span> <span data-start="1454.76" data-end="1456.26">And so what we're going for here is</span> <span data-start="1456.26" data-end="1459.46">a UI where we have a spinner — </span> <span data-start="1459.46" data-end="1461.96">and it happened again.</span> <span data-start="1461.96" data-end="1462.46">There we go.</span> <span data-start="1462.46" data-end="1463.12">OK.</span> <span data-start="1463.12" data-end="1465.74">Might just be a faulty button here.</span> <span data-start="1465.74" data-end="1468.53">So what we want to add here is a spinner at the top of the UI</span> <span data-start="1468.53" data-end="1471.76">that's going to be going whenever there are pending</span> <span data-start="1471.76" data-end="1473.86">search results coming back from the server,</span> <span data-start="1473.86" data-end="1476.36">or we have children that need to update.</span> <span data-start="1476.36" data-end="1478.512">So now you see we get the spinner as we type.</span> <span data-start="1478.512" data-end="1480.22">We don't get the spinner on the children,</span> <span data-start="1480.22" data-end="1483.05">but we can see the top level spinner is still going.</span> <span data-start="1483.05" data-end="1485.836">And then the results come in and the spinner stops.</span> <span data-start="1485.836" data-end="1487.46">And so that's the UI we were going for,</span> <span data-start="1487.46" data-end="1489.34">and it was pretty straightforward to build</span> <span data-start="1489.34" data-end="1492.16">with these directives.</span> <span data-start="1492.16" data-end="1493.834">So when you have an asynchronous UI,</span> <span data-start="1493.834" data-end="1495.25">there's a lot of different options</span> <span data-start="1495.25" data-end="1497.48">that you have for how to handle this.</span> <span data-start="1497.48" data-end="1501.61">You could try to block the UI while you have pending work.</span> <span data-start="1501.61" data-end="1504.07">You could show the raw incremental updates.</span> <span data-start="1504.07" data-end="1506.14">You could have individual spinners on your page,</span> <span data-start="1506.14" data-end="1508.51">or you could try to replace that all with top level</span> <span data-start="1508.51" data-end="1510.67">placeholders and spinners.</span> <span data-start="1510.67" data-end="1514.904">So what you want to do depends on the UX and the UI</span> <span data-start="1514.904" data-end="1516.07">that you're trying to build.</span> <span data-start="1516.07" data-end="1519.46">But the key here is to provide the plumbing and the framework</span> <span data-start="1519.46" data-end="1521.86">and the nice API so that you can build</span> <span data-start="1521.86" data-end="1524.69">whatever you choose to build.</span> <span data-start="1524.69" data-end="1526.51">And that went two slides forward.</span> <span data-start="1526.51" data-end="1529.96">All right, well, this is my wrap up.</span> <span data-start="1529.96" data-end="1532.48">So we're very excited about some additional work that's</span> <span data-start="1532.48" data-end="1533.83">going to be done in this area.</span> <span data-start="1533.83" data-end="1536.08">So Jason and Shubhie talked about the native scheduler</span> <span data-start="1536.08" data-end="1538.9">API, which we're extremely excited about.</span> <span data-start="1538.9" data-end="1540.49">Display locking is a new proposal</span> <span data-start="1540.49" data-end="1541.39">where you're going to be able to lock</span> <span data-start="1541.39" data-end="1543.223">an entire portion of your screen so that you</span> <span data-start="1543.223" data-end="1545.08">can update it incrementally and then</span> <span data-start="1545.08" data-end="1546.605">flip it to the new version.</span> <span data-start="1546.605" data-end="1548.23">And Greg talked about virtual scroller,</span> <span data-start="1548.23" data-end="1551.324">which is going to let us handle large amounts of data as well.</span> <span data-start="1551.324" data-end="1553.99">And then on our end, we're going to be working on more libraries</span> <span data-start="1553.99" data-end="1556">and examples of how to do things like lazy load</span> <span data-start="1556" data-end="1559.522">components, background rendering, and viewport base</span> <span data-start="1559.522" data-end="1561.73">visibility rendering, so that things only render when</span> <span data-start="1561.73" data-end="1564.27">they show up on the screen.</span> <span data-start="1564.27" data-end="1565.27">I have a few links here.</span> <span data-start="1565.27" data-end="1568.3">These will probably be easier to get to from the video.</span> <span data-start="1568.3" data-end="1571.24">And then I'm going to be over in the Ask Chrome area</span> <span data-start="1571.24" data-end="1574.75">doing Q&A after this, if you'd like to ask any questions.</span> <span data-start="1574.75" data-end="1576.49">OK, thank you.</span> <span data-start="1576.49"
