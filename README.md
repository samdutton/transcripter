# Create readable transcripts from YouTube captions

This is a Node application that processes caption files from Google, Android
and Chrome Developer channels to create readable transcripts.

The code could easily be adapted to work with caption files from other playlists.

Try it out at [bit.ly/transcripter](https://bit.ly/transcripter).

---

## Installation and usage

1. Clone or download the code.
2. Add your SRT caption files to the [_input_](src/input) directory.
3. From a terminal `cd` to the `src` directory and run `node index.js`,
optionally setting flags (see below).
4. Progress updates and errors will be logged to the console.
5. When conversion is complete, view the results from
[index.html](docs/index.html) in the [_output_](docs) directory, the directory
used for GitHub Pages. This directory includes a [CSS file](docs/css/main.css)
and a [JavaScript file](docs/js/main.js) to style the transcripts and
enable interaction.

### Input and output directories

* When you clone the repo, the [_input_](src/input) and [_output_](docs)
directories contain sample files.
* You can customize _input_ and _output_ directories â€” see flags below.

## Error handling

Check for errors in _error-log.txt_.

## Known issues

### Google Translate widget

This widget is [no longer supported](https://translate.google.com/intl/en/about/website)
and the language selection popup is not laid out responsively.

Probably best to remove unless the layout can be fixed (others have tried!)
