# Create readable transcripts from Google developer YouTube captions

This is a Node application that processes caption files from Google, Android and Chrome Developer channels to create readable transcripts.

It could easily be adapted to work with caption files from other playlists.

## Installation and usage

1. Clone or download the code.
2. Add `.srt` caption files to the [_input_](src/input) directory.
3. From a terminal `cd` to the `src` directory and run `node index.js`,
optionally setting flags (see below).
4. Progress updates and errors will be logged to the console.
5. When conversion is complete, view the results in the [_output_](src/output)
directory.

### Input and output

The language selection popup is not laid out responsively.

Probably best to remove.
