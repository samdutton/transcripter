<p><span data-start="11.807" data-end="13.14"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Hi, my name is Malte.</span> <span data-start="13.14" data-end="16.12">I work on AMP and JavaScript infrastructure at Google.</span> <span data-start="16.12" data-end="18.63">So actually, this is a little bit awkward today because,</span> <span data-start="18.63" data-end="19.706">for the second keynote — </span> <span data-start="19.706" data-end="22.08">and Ben and [? Dion ?] already talked about, effectively,</span> <span data-start="22.08" data-end="23.77">everything yesterday — </span> <span data-start="23.77" data-end="27.01">so we thought we'd do something slightly different.</span> <span data-start="27.01" data-end="29.82">So normally, at a Chrome Dev Summit keynote,</span> <span data-start="29.82" data-end="31.83">we'd walk through all the new, exciting APIs</span> <span data-start="31.83" data-end="34.21">that the [INAUDIBLE] platform makes available for you.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="34.21" data-end="36.28">And so we actually are going to do that.</span> <span data-start="36.28" data-end="39.34">But first, we want to talk about something slightly different.</span> <span data-start="39.34" data-end="42.109">We want to talk about web frameworks.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="42.109" data-end="44.4"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: Developers who build for the web often</span> <span data-start="44.4" data-end="46.29">choose to use a framework.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="46.29" data-end="48.09">In the past, changes to the web platform,</span> <span data-start="48.09" data-end="51">didn't necessarily take the frameworks into account,</span> <span data-start="51" data-end="52.89">and changes to frameworks didn't necessarily</span> <span data-start="52.89" data-end="54.69">take the web platform into account.</span> <span data-start="54.69" data-end="58.05">We think both the web platform and frameworks benefit</span> <span data-start="58.05" data-end="59.88">from a close collaboration, and so we're</span> <span data-start="59.88" data-end="63.251">out to make that happen.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="63.251" data-end="65.209">Obviously, if you're building something simple,</span> <span data-start="65.209" data-end="67.81">it makes sense to choose simple technologies.</span> <span data-start="67.81" data-end="70.3">But as soon as an app is sufficiently complex,</span> <span data-start="70.3" data-end="73.9">in most cases, developers choose to use a framework.</span> <span data-start="73.9" data-end="78.52">A few months ago, I put out a very, very methodologically</span> <span data-start="78.52" data-end="81.82">correct Twitter poll, asking people</span> <span data-start="81.82" data-end="83.53">why they choose to use frameworks,</span> <span data-start="83.53" data-end="85.36">and got back a whole bunch of answers.</span> <span data-start="85.36" data-end="87.25">And this one, in particular, sort of</span> <span data-start="87.25" data-end="89.86">resonated with a lot of people.</span> <span data-start="89.86" data-end="91.69">"You can't not use a framework.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="91.69" data-end="93.31">Your only real choice is to either use</span> <span data-start="93.31" data-end="96.34">one that's open source, documented, tested, supported,</span> <span data-start="96.34" data-end="97.81">maintained, mature and proven" — </span> <span data-start="97.81" data-end="100.6">and I think we'd all throw, you can stack overflow stuff</span> <span data-start="100.6" data-end="102.34">about it into that one.</span> <span data-start="102.34" data-end="105.67">Or the option B is you cobble together some garbage,</span> <span data-start="105.67" data-end="107.41">unmaintainable stuff yourself.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="107.41" data-end="108.79"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: I've made a few of those, actually.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="108.79" data-end="109.15"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>:  Yeah, I might have</span> <span data-start="109.15" data-end="111.61">made one or to have those in my day before.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="111.61" data-end="113.26"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: And given that, we just</span> <span data-start="113.26" data-end="115.27">want to start by recognizing that frameworks</span> <span data-start="115.27" data-end="116.35">are part of the web.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="116.35" data-end="118.54">And if you're using a framework, you</span> <span data-start="118.54" data-end="121.43">are in fact using the platform.</span> <span data-start="121.43" data-end="124.15">So let's go from there and kind of extrapolate</span> <span data-start="124.15" data-end="129.13">to the further web stack that is based on that insight.</span> <span data-start="129.13" data-end="131.75">So on the bottom, obviously, you have the web primitives.</span> <span data-start="131.75" data-end="135.19">So that would be the Dom, the Fetch API, service workers,</span> <span data-start="135.19" data-end="137.432">stuff like that.</span> </p>
<p></p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="137.432" data-end="139.89"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: Then above that, we have built-in modules.</span> <span data-start="139.89" data-end="141.557">Built-in modules are pretty exciting.</span> <span data-start="141.557" data-end="142.39">They're a new thing.</span> <span data-start="142.39" data-end="146.86">It's the idea that we can build in a layered way for the web.</span> <span data-start="146.86" data-end="149.94">They're high-level APIs that solve something</span> <span data-start="149.94" data-end="152.07">like virtual scrolling or carousels.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="152.07" data-end="153.804">I think we all love to hate the carousel.</span> <span data-start="153.804" data-end="155.22">But if we're truly honest, they're</span> <span data-start="155.22" data-end="158.14">on almost every site in the known universe.</span> <span data-start="158.14" data-end="160.14">So we can build something like a high-level API,</span> <span data-start="160.14" data-end="162.48">like a virtual scroller, and then that</span> <span data-start="162.48" data-end="164.64">drives out the low-level APIs that we</span> <span data-start="164.64" data-end="168.12">need to make those experiences accessible, searchable, truly</span> <span data-start="168.12" data-end="169.41">fast.</span> <span data-start="169.41" data-end="172.86">Those low-level APIs can then be used by the entire ecosystem</span> <span data-start="172.86" data-end="174.36">of virtual scrollers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="174.36" data-end="176.61">That makes a big difference because it allows everyone</span> <span data-start="176.61" data-end="178.072">to level up together.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="178.072" data-end="178.78"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="178.78" data-end="180.63">Then one level up, we've got the frameworks.</span> <span data-start="180.63" data-end="183.66">So that would be like React, Angular, Polymer,</span> <span data-start="183.66" data-end="187.83">or higher-level stuff, like Next.js and Sapper that kind of</span> <span data-start="187.83" data-end="190.5">treat you to everything that you need to build an application.</span> <span data-start="190.5" data-end="192.5">So obviously, these aren't standardized.</span> <span data-start="192.5" data-end="194.79">They're not web standards, but most applications</span> <span data-start="194.79" data-end="195.64">use one of these.</span> <span data-start="195.64" data-end="198.969">And so we think of them as part of the platform.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="198.969" data-end="201.01"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: The next part is web components.</span> <span data-start="201.01" data-end="202.03">And you're probably thinking, wait,</span> <span data-start="202.03" data-end="203.196">that doesn't make any sense.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="203.196" data-end="205.9">Web components are a web primitive or a web standard.</span> <span data-start="205.9" data-end="208.45">I'm not talking about the web components, the standards,</span> <span data-start="208.45" data-end="210.91">I'm talking about your web components —  your date picker</span> <span data-start="210.91" data-end="212.45">or, I don't know, tabs.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="251.297" data-end="253.63"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Wouldn't it be nice if you could use the date</span> <span data-start="253.63" data-end="254.837">picker in both of those?</span> <span data-start="254.837" data-end="256.42">If you could have a design system that</span> <span data-start="256.42" data-end="258.61">spans your entire applications suite,</span> <span data-start="258.61" data-end="260.05">no other framework gets built in.</span> <span data-start="260.05" data-end="262.63">So that's where we think the leaf components, web</span> <span data-start="262.63" data-end="265.909">components, are really the right technology to build that.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="265.909" data-end="267.95"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: There's, however, a real problem</span> <span data-start="267.95" data-end="269.54">with web development today.</span> <span data-start="269.54" data-end="271.19">We're struggling to make stuff that's</span> <span data-start="271.19" data-end="273.765">really fast and responsive and has buttery-smooth animations.</span> <span data-start="273.765" data-end="276.14">And I think we're struggling because, in a bunch of ways,</span> <span data-start="276.14" data-end="277.89">it's actually really hard.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="277.89" data-end="279.14">Not everybody struggles.</span> <span data-start="279.14" data-end="281.42">There are examples of sites that achieve this.</span> <span data-start="281.42" data-end="284.75">But at scale, what we observe is that our performance goals</span> <span data-start="284.75" data-end="286.352">aren't being met.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="286.352" data-end="287.06"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="287.06" data-end="290.665">And so what we're observing is that, in web dev today,</span> <span data-start="290.665" data-end="292.79">we often have to make that choice between developer</span> <span data-start="292.79" data-end="293.93">experience — </span> <span data-start="293.93" data-end="295.64">how we feel as developers —  and user</span> <span data-start="295.64" data-end="297.41">experience —  how users feel.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="297.41" data-end="299.97">And that shouldn't really be how things are.</span> <span data-start="299.97" data-end="303.08">In the vast majority of cases, developer experience</span> <span data-start="303.08" data-end="306.11">combined to accumulate a great user experience —  that's</span> <span data-start="306.11" data-end="307.68">just not how it works today.</span> <span data-start="307.68" data-end="310.31">But if we can achieve those things coming together,</span> <span data-start="310.31" data-end="312.624">the web will be better for everyone.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="511.34" data-end="511.84">Great.</span> <span data-start="511.84" data-end="514.789">So to summarize this, we really want to get to a state</span> <span data-start="514.789" data-end="518.27">where not only the super experts can make great web experiences,</span> <span data-start="518.27" data-end="519.844">everyone should be able to do it.</span> <span data-start="519.844" data-end="522.26">And frameworks are an integral part of making that happen.</span> <span data-start="522.26" data-end="524.12">Today, we feel that we — </span> <span data-start="524.12" data-end="526.76">and by we, I mean browsers, framework and tools — </span> <span data-start="526.76" data-end="528.554">have under-invested in tools that</span> <span data-start="528.554" data-end="529.97">focus on combining great developer</span> <span data-start="529.97" data-end="531.9">experience with a focus on user experience.</span> <span data-start="531.9" data-end="533.82">Well, we can make this happen as a community.</span> <span data-start="533.82" data-end="536.12">By integrating the best practices for performance</span> <span data-start="536.12" data-end="538.76">into frameworks, all users of those frameworks</span> <span data-start="538.76" data-end="540.58">automatically get all the benefits.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="540.58" data-end="542.163">And that's how we think we can achieve</span> <span data-start="542.163" data-end="546.24">great outcomes for users at the scale of the web.</span> <span data-start="546.24" data-end="547.179">All right.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="547.179" data-end="548.72"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: To make this happen,</span> <span data-start="548.72" data-end="551.73">we're announcing three things today.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="551.73" data-end="553.85">The first one is, we are including</span> <span data-start="553.85" data-end="557.317">frameworks in the Chrome Intent to Implement process.</span> <span data-start="557.317" data-end="559.4">How many folks know about our intent to implement,</span> <span data-start="559.4" data-end="561.17">intent to ship stuff?</span> <span data-start="561.17" data-end="561.71">A few.</span> <span data-start="561.71" data-end="561.98">Great.</span> <span data-start="561.98" data-end="562.73">That's awesome.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="562.73" data-end="565.07">So we have, basically, two important check points — </span> <span data-start="565.07" data-end="566.6">we have more than that, but two very</span> <span data-start="566.6" data-end="567.8">important check points —  when we're</span> <span data-start="567.8" data-end="569.18">going to ship a new feature.</span> <span data-start="569.18" data-end="571.4">One is our intent to implement and the other</span> <span data-start="571.4" data-end="573.23">is our intent to ship.</span> <span data-start="573.23" data-end="575.686">At both points, when we are about to build something</span> <span data-start="575.686" data-end="577.31">and when we're about to ship something,</span> <span data-start="577.31" data-end="578.79">we want to get a lot of feedback.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="578.79" data-end="581.27">And so we go through this intent process</span> <span data-start="581.27" data-end="584.45">in order to intentionally go in and draw in that feedback.</span> <span data-start="584.45" data-end="588.41">Previously, we had listed web developers as folks</span> <span data-start="588.41" data-end="590.24">that we wanted to get feedback from.</span> <span data-start="590.24" data-end="592.07">But now, we're actually explicitly adding</span> <span data-start="592.07" data-end="595.86">frameworks to that intent to implement process.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="595.86" data-end="596.73"><span class="speaker">Malte Ubl</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="596.73" data-end="599.67">And secondly, we want to put real dollars behind this.</span> <span data-start="599.67" data-end="601.76">So we're starting with a budget of $200,000</span> <span data-start="601.76" data-end="604.37">to kickstart developing of performance-related features</span> <span data-start="604.37" data-end="605.72">in frameworks.</span> <span data-start="605.72" data-end="607.97">In particular, we make available a list of performance</span> <span data-start="607.97" data-end="610.64">features that we'd love all frameworks to provide</span> <span data-start="610.64" data-end="614.13">to the users by default. Folks who are working on a framework</span> <span data-start="614.13" data-end="616.57">can ask for funding to do the actual work.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="616.57" data-end="618.5">We're still working out the exact details.</span> <span data-start="618.5" data-end="621.29">But if you're interested, check out this bit.ly link</span> <span data-start="621.29" data-end="622.652">for more information.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="635.19" data-end="637.34">And we've been working with a bunch of frameworks</span> <span data-start="637.34" data-end="640.43">for the past several months, but we</span> <span data-start="640.43" data-end="642.47">are excited today to talk through some</span> <span data-start="642.47" data-end="644.792">of what we've started already.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="659.12" data-end="661.02">We're really just thinking about them.</span> <span data-start="661.02" data-end="664.16">So it's still very much time to give us your feedback, your use</span> <span data-start="664.16" data-end="667.784">cases, your examples, to work out how they really work.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="667.784" data-end="669.95"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: The first one we want to talk about</span> <span data-start="669.95" data-end="671.6">is Display Locking.</span> <span data-start="671.6" data-end="674.04">We basically don't want to update the DOM inadvertently,</span> <span data-start="674.04" data-end="676.16">and so this gives us a way to lock it.</span> <span data-start="676.16" data-end="679.37">Before I joined Google, there —  well, many times,</span> <span data-start="679.37" data-end="682.06">I think this is one of the most requested features.</span> <span data-start="682.06" data-end="686.51">But before I joined Google, the Polymer team and the Paint team</span> <span data-start="686.51" data-end="688.97">had a bunch of conversations about a new primitive</span> <span data-start="688.97" data-end="690.512">called Display Locking.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="690.512" data-end="692.72">The idea of Display Locking is that you can basically</span> <span data-start="692.72" data-end="695.09">lock down a section of your DOM, and we</span> <span data-start="695.09" data-end="697.79">won't trigger render and other things on that bit of DOM</span> <span data-start="697.79" data-end="701.03">until you unlock it and say, OK, it's ready to go.</span> <span data-start="701.03" data-end="701.799">It's super subtle.</span> <span data-start="701.799" data-end="704.09">And it may not be something you interact with directly,</span> <span data-start="704.09" data-end="706.548">but it's definitely something that frameworks need in order</span> <span data-start="706.548" data-end="709.097">to eliminate unnecessary browser work.</span> <span data-start="709.097" data-end="710.93">Now, we're collaborating with the React team</span> <span data-start="710.93" data-end="712.22">to nail down the API.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="712.22" data-end="714.08">And we had an Intent to Implement out</span> <span data-start="714.08" data-end="715.02">about a month ago.</span> <span data-start="715.02" data-end="717.12">So if you have comments, we'd love to hear them.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="764.162" data-end="765.62">You're probably familiar with stuff</span> <span data-start="765.62" data-end="768.442">like this from the material design specification</span> <span data-start="768.442" data-end="769.9">where one page morphs to the other.</span> <span data-start="769.9" data-end="771.737">And there's other ideas how to do this.</span> <span data-start="771.737" data-end="774.32">Now, this is something you would see in your application going</span> <span data-start="774.32" data-end="777.65">from one state to another, but we also</span> <span data-start="777.65" data-end="780.02">want this for normal navigations, right?</span> <span data-start="780.02" data-end="781.08">Here's a great example.</span> <span data-start="781.08" data-end="783.95">So this is something the image search team at Google</span> <span data-start="783.95" data-end="784.534">is working on.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="788.83" data-end="790.58">So this is their image search result page.</span> <span data-start="790.58" data-end="792.89">And when you click one of the images,</span> <span data-start="792.89" data-end="796.8">you go into this box to see the larger version of the image.</span> <span data-start="796.8" data-end="799.01">So their goal was that more people click through</span> <span data-start="799.01" data-end="800.73">to the underlying web page.</span> <span data-start="800.73" data-end="803.36">And so they wanted to make that really</span> <span data-start="803.36" data-end="805.79">easy by just literally putting that web</span> <span data-start="805.79" data-end="809.12">page at the bottom of the page, right?</span> <span data-start="809.12" data-end="813.5">So that, as a user, all you have to do is put your finger on it</span> <span data-start="813.5" data-end="817.49">and draw it up.</span> <span data-start="817.49" data-end="820.63">We're hoping that this greatly increases</span> <span data-start="820.63" data-end="823.22">the number of navigations actually happening.</span> <span data-start="823.22" data-end="825.11">But this is something that you really just</span> <span data-start="825.11" data-end="826.319">can't build on the web today.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="860.03" data-end="864.56">But here, you can —  and this is what this example GIF shows — </span> <span data-start="864.56" data-end="867.78">this is a navigation from one web page to another.</span> <span data-start="867.78" data-end="870.74">And you can morph between them any way you like,</span> <span data-start="870.74" data-end="873.429">which seems like something we should have in 2018.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="874.97" data-end="875.479">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="875.479" data-end="877.52">I think sometimes people choose a single-page app</span> <span data-start="877.52" data-end="879.35">with all of its complexity, when actually what they</span> <span data-start="879.35" data-end="880.45">wanted was fancy transitions.</span> <span data-start="880.45" data-end="880.83">So we hope that this [INAUDIBLE]</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1142.25" data-end="1143.67">It doesn't really matter.</span> <span data-start="1143.67" data-end="1146.36">You can do basically HTTP over anything, which is really cool.</span> <span data-start="1149.659" data-end="1150.7">Oh, my god, look at this.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1458.22" data-end="1459.41">So you can use them.</span> <span data-start="1459.41" data-end="1460.9">And you should use these APIs.</span> <span data-start="1460.9" data-end="1463.82">And Animation Worklet doesn't provide additional value,</span> <span data-start="1463.82" data-end="1466.97">except in some very important circumstances.</span> <span data-start="1466.97" data-end="1470.18">Because these APIs are inherently time-based,</span> <span data-start="1470.18" data-end="1473.39">which makes sense, animations go from A to B over time.</span> <span data-start="1473.39" data-end="1475.26">That's kind of what they do.</span> <span data-start="1475.26" data-end="1476.9">However, there are some animations</span> <span data-start="1476.9" data-end="1478.55">that aren't time-based.</span> <span data-start="1478.55" data-end="1481.22">For example, this one, which animates Pac-Man</span> <span data-start="1481.22" data-end="1483.35">based on scrolling left and right.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1483.35" data-end="1485.39">And this is something that's really difficult</span> <span data-start="1485.39" data-end="1487.94">to do on the web today in a jank-free fashion.</span> <span data-start="1490.71" data-end="1493.05">So the reason for this is that, with Animation Worklet,</span> <span data-start="1493.05" data-end="1494.841">on the other hand, where you don't get jank</span> <span data-start="1494.841" data-end="1497.55">is because that actual worklet runs super close</span> <span data-start="1497.55" data-end="1500.16">to the actual software that does the scrolling.</span> <span data-start="1500.16" data-end="1503.94">And so you can do it, even when the main thread does anything</span> <span data-start="1503.94" data-end="1506.13">busy, which is really cool.</span> <span data-start="1506.13" data-end="1508.02">My team actually has been working</span> <span data-start="1508.02" data-end="1511.5">on getting this into our —  what we call —  scrollbot animations.</span> <span data-start="1511.5" data-end="1513.64">And it was just a drop-in replacement.</span> <span data-start="1513.64" data-end="1516.445">And it makes everything so much smoother.</span> <span data-start="1516.445" data-end="1518.32">[?
