<p><span data-start="29.69" data-end="32.63">OS, and I'm here to tell you a story of software development</span> <span data-start="32.63" data-end="36.36">on the web, and the work Google, Microsoft, Intel,</span> <span data-start="36.36" data-end="40.05">and others are doing to build the future of the platform.</span> <span data-start="40.05" data-end="41.66">This is the story of how we're looking</span> <span data-start="41.66" data-end="44.39">to bridge the native app gap.</span> <span data-start="44.39" data-end="46.67">The story for me starts fall of last year,</span> <span data-start="46.67" data-end="48.66">setting up my new computer.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="48.66" data-end="50.27">I had previously used a combination</span> <span data-start="50.27" data-end="53.69">of native apps and command-line tools to optimize images.</span> <span data-start="53.69" data-end="56.88">Then I tried Squoosh.app, a PWA from the Chrome Dev</span> <span data-start="56.88" data-end="59.15">rel [? team. ?] It worked on my Chromebook,</span> <span data-start="59.15" data-end="61.58">it worked on my Mac, and it worked on Windows.</span> <span data-start="61.58" data-end="63.02">It's just a website.</span> <span data-start="63.02" data-end="64.73">But with a simple install prompt it</span> <span data-start="64.73" data-end="67.61">found its way to my app launchers,</span> <span data-start="67.61" data-end="70.43">and replacing all of my native tools.</span> <span data-start="70.43" data-end="73.28">To me, it became clear that PWAs should</span> <span data-start="73.28" data-end="75.75">be the future of software delivery.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="75.75" data-end="78.68">They're built using modern APIs, enhanced</span> <span data-start="78.68" data-end="82.52">to deliver native-like installability, reliability,</span> <span data-start="82.52" data-end="86.63">and capabilities, all while reaching anyone, anywhere,</span> <span data-start="86.63" data-end="89.15">on any device.</span> <span data-start="89.15" data-end="91.96">There are still some gaps, though.</span> <span data-start="91.96" data-end="94.84">The web is super powerful in its own right today.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="94.84" data-end="96.79">You can build a hyper local video chat</span> <span data-start="96.79" data-end="100.45">app with WebRTC, geolocation, and push messaging.</span> <span data-start="100.45" data-end="102.07">You can make that app installable.</span> <span data-start="102.07" data-end="104.12">You can add video effects with Wasm,</span> <span data-start="104.12" data-end="106.18">and you can even bring it into new realities</span> <span data-start="106.18" data-end="108.64">with WebGL and WebVR.</span> <span data-start="108.64" data-end="111.19">But there's still gaps in what we can solve with the web</span> <span data-start="111.19" data-end="112.54">today.</span> <span data-start="112.54" data-end="115.21">In the worst case, this means that developers are not</span> <span data-start="115.21" data-end="117.73">building for the web at all, or they're relegating it</span> <span data-start="117.73" data-end="120.048">to a second-class experience.</span> <span data-start="120.048" data-end="121.84">For those that do want to build for the web</span> <span data-start="121.84" data-end="124.42">but need the capabilities of native,</span> <span data-start="124.42" data-end="127.63">they're forced to bundle web apps in native wrappers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="127.63" data-end="129.639">This often results in developers effectively</span> <span data-start="129.639" data-end="132.61">shipping their own custom browsers to users,</span> <span data-start="132.61" data-end="134.71">exploding the size of their web apps</span> <span data-start="134.71" data-end="137.71">and forcing them to take on the security and maintenance</span> <span data-start="137.71" data-end="139.99">burden of both keeping the browser</span> <span data-start="139.99" data-end="143.05">and their native wrapper up to date.</span> <span data-start="143.05" data-end="145.81">These native wrappers also lose the reach of the web,</span> <span data-start="145.81" data-end="148">forcing them to choose what devices and operating</span> <span data-start="148" data-end="150.25">systems to support, often requiring</span> <span data-start="150.25" data-end="152.23">different native wrappers, all of which</span> <span data-start="152.23" data-end="156.65">further expands the security and maintenance burden.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="156.65" data-end="160.07">Filling these gaps is the key to fixing this and enabling</span> <span data-start="160.07" data-end="162.71">the web to be the software platform of the future,</span> <span data-start="162.71" data-end="165.3">like we believe it to be.</span> <span data-start="165.3" data-end="167.22">What does this future look like?</span> <span data-start="167.22" data-end="170.45">What do you think is missing from the web platform today?</span> <span data-start="170.45" data-end="173.48">What is the web you want?</span> <span data-start="173.48" data-end="175.55">I'm going to tell you two stories of two</span> <span data-start="175.55" data-end="177.83">fictional developers, Quinn, working</span> <span data-start="177.83" data-end="181.61">on Fugujournal, and Sawyer, working on Fuguedit.</span> <span data-start="181.61" data-end="184.837">Both Quinn and Sawyer want to solve problems for their users</span> <span data-start="184.837" data-end="186.92">that have usually been outside the scope of what's</span> <span data-start="186.92" data-end="188.81">possible on the web.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="188.81" data-end="191.75">As you'll see, both will leverage new capabilities</span> <span data-start="191.75" data-end="196.87">that change what's possible to build their applications.</span> <span data-start="196.87" data-end="199.41">We start with Quinn, the lead developer for a social media</span> <span data-start="199.41" data-end="201.48">startup, Fugujournal.</span> <span data-start="201.48" data-end="203.795">Social apps on mobile devices have been hard,</span> <span data-start="203.795" data-end="205.92">because they need to be tightly integrated in order</span> <span data-start="205.92" data-end="210.78">to be loved by their users Quinn thinks to themself.</span> <span data-start="210.78" data-end="213.24">Our users want to start a journal entry from anywhere</span> <span data-start="213.24" data-end="214.77">on their device, and they want to be</span> <span data-start="214.77" data-end="218.22">able to share those entries to other social accounts.</span> <span data-start="218.22" data-end="221.84">They also want to collaborate on entries with their friends,</span> <span data-start="221.84" data-end="225.06">so they need to be able to invite them to do so easily.</span> <span data-start="225.06" data-end="227.19">Until recently, these capabilities</span> <span data-start="227.19" data-end="229.53">would seem to rule out building a web app.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="229.53" data-end="233.46">They just simply didn't exist Both Web Share and the new Web</span> <span data-start="233.46" data-end="236.16">Share Target V2 and Contacts APIs — </span> <span data-start="236.16" data-end="238.26">that calculus has changed, and Quinn</span> <span data-start="238.26" data-end="242.49">can build a progressive web app, instead of a native app.</span> <span data-start="242.49" data-end="244.59">Let's see what Quinn is looking to do.</span> <span data-start="244.59" data-end="246.69">After a user navigates to Fugujournal,</span> <span data-start="246.69" data-end="249.42">they should be able to install it to their home screen.</span> <span data-start="249.42" data-end="253.27">Once installed, they should be able to find media, images,</span> <span data-start="253.27" data-end="256.14">video, and audio from throughout their phone</span> <span data-start="256.14" data-end="258.49">and share it to Fugujournal.</span> <span data-start="258.49" data-end="261.269">Users should then be able to share any entry using</span> <span data-start="261.269" data-end="265.9">the native share sheet of their phone to another application.</span> <span data-start="265.9" data-end="268.53">Finally, they should be able to find contacts from their phone</span> <span data-start="268.53" data-end="271.56">to invite them to collaborate, sending off invitations</span> <span data-start="271.56" data-end="276.47">once they verify their contacts' information.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="276.47" data-end="278.34">Diving into how Quinn can make this work,</span> <span data-start="278.34" data-end="281.33">let's start by looking at Web Share Target V2.</span> <span data-start="281.33" data-end="285.11">This allows installed PWAs to both register as a share target</span> <span data-start="285.11" data-end="287.87">and describe what can be shared to it.</span> <span data-start="287.87" data-end="290.03">To add it to Fugujournal, Quinn needs</span> <span data-start="290.03" data-end="293.27">to update the web app manifest to include a share target.</span> <span data-start="293.27" data-end="296.61">You can only have one share target per web app manifest.</span> <span data-start="296.61" data-end="298.13">And there are three parameters — </span> <span data-start="298.13" data-end="302.008">action, which is the URL to open when shared to.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="302.008" data-end="303.8">This should be pre-cached when your service</span> <span data-start="303.8" data-end="306.74">worker is installed, so that it's always available.</span> <span data-start="306.74" data-end="310.67">Method, which determines how to share items to your PWA.</span> <span data-start="310.67" data-end="313.07">If you want to use POST instead of GET,</span> <span data-start="313.07" data-end="316.36">you need an ENC-type parameter as well for encoding.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="316.36" data-end="318.987">And then params, which is what is allowed to be shared</span> <span data-start="318.987" data-end="320.57">and what those items should be called.</span> <span data-start="324.87" data-end="328.03">Each of the parameters inside of params is optional.</span> <span data-start="328.03" data-end="331.65">You can have title, you can have text, you can have url,</span> <span data-start="331.65" data-end="334.56">and you can even have an array of files,</span> <span data-start="334.56" data-end="337.41">each with their own MIME type and a different name</span> <span data-start="337.41" data-end="339.27">for those MIME types.</span> <span data-start="339.27" data-end="341.91">When shared, the data is sent to the action</span> <span data-start="341.91" data-end="348.08">URL as form data that can then be parsed and used as needed.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="348.08" data-end="350.04">A neat trick you can do for a share target</span> <span data-start="350.04" data-end="352.83">is to register a route directly in your service worker</span> <span data-start="352.83" data-end="354.39">to handle the request.</span> <span data-start="354.39" data-end="357.39">This will let you use it even without a back end.</span> <span data-start="357.39" data-end="359.7">Here, we're importing work boxes, route register,</span> <span data-start="359.7" data-end="362.04">and registering our service or our share target</span> <span data-start="362.04" data-end="364.53">as a route, a post route, calling</span> <span data-start="364.53" data-end="368.54">shareTargetHandler function, which looks like this.</span> <span data-start="368.54" data-end="371.25">The shareTargetHandler is an async function</span> <span data-start="371.25" data-end="374.4">that takes in the event and awaits the form data,</span> <span data-start="374.4" data-end="377.31">and peels off the media files from that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="377.31" data-end="379.6">You can then do whatever you'd like with these files.</span> <span data-start="379.6" data-end="380.65">You can cache them.</span> <span data-start="380.65" data-end="383.07">You can send them somewhere with a fetch request.</span> <span data-start="383.07" data-end="385.74">You can even make use of the rest of the options,</span> <span data-start="385.74" data-end="388.56">maybe serving a page with some query parameters</span> <span data-start="388.56" data-end="391.59">for the other shared items or storing the data and pointers</span> <span data-start="391.59" data-end="393.66">to the media in indexed DB.</span> <span data-start="396.6" data-end="399.03">Once the journal entry is in Fugujournal,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="399.03" data-end="402.21">Quinn's users need to be able to share it back out.</span> <span data-start="402.21" data-end="404.25">To do so, when the Share button is clicked,</span> <span data-start="404.25" data-end="407.49">Quinn checks to see if navigator.share is available.</span> <span data-start="407.49" data-end="410.88">If so, it'll use the native share sheet.</span> <span data-start="410.88" data-end="415.61">If not, we can fall back to custom sharing options.</span> <span data-start="415.61" data-end="417.23">To activate the native share sheet,</span> <span data-start="417.23" data-end="420.14">Quinn calls navigator.share, a promise,</span> <span data-start="420.14" data-end="424.04">and passes it at least one of the optional parameters — </span> <span data-start="424.04" data-end="426.74">title, which is the title of the item being shared;</span> <span data-start="426.74" data-end="429.31">text, which is the text to be shared;</span> <span data-start="429.31" data-end="431">the URL that is being shared — </span> <span data-start="431" data-end="432.98">and note, this doesn't need to be the URL</span> <span data-start="432.98" data-end="434.18">that you're currently on.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="434.18" data-end="436.04">It can be any URL.</span> <span data-start="436.04" data-end="439.67">And then an array of files to be shared out as well.</span> <span data-start="442.38" data-end="445.23">With both Web Share and Web Share Target in place,</span> <span data-start="445.23" data-end="447.8">Quinn is ready to test sharing to Fugujournal.</span> <span data-start="447.8" data-end="451.17">They start by finding a file to create an entry from.</span> <span data-start="451.17" data-end="453.75">Opening the file, they tap on the kabob menu,</span> <span data-start="453.75" data-end="456.6">hit Send, find Fugujournal in the share sheet,</span> <span data-start="456.6" data-end="458.52">and then tap it.</span> <span data-start="458.52" data-end="460.36">This opens the image in Fugujournal,</span> <span data-start="460.36" data-end="462.005">posted and ready to go.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="462.005" data-end="465.26">They then click the Share button from an entry, and, hey, look!</span> <span data-start="465.26" data-end="467.34">Android's native share sheet pops up,</span> <span data-start="467.34" data-end="471.06">ready to share Twitter's PWA has also implemented</span> <span data-start="471.06" data-end="473.43">Web Share and Web Share Target V2,</span> <span data-start="473.43" data-end="476.19">so Quinn can share their entry over to Twitter.</span> <span data-start="476.19" data-end="479.65">With a tap, Quinn's brought over to the Twitter PWA,</span> <span data-start="479.65" data-end="482.55">and their post is ready to be tweeted out</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="482.55" data-end="487.06">Quinn now turns their attention to the contact picker.</span> <span data-start="487.06" data-end="489.2">Contact picker is also a promise,</span> <span data-start="489.2" data-end="492.76">so we're going to wrap it in an async function.</span> <span data-start="492.76" data-end="494.95">When the function is run, Quinn checks for support</span> <span data-start="494.95" data-end="497.35">by making sure both navigator.contacts</span> <span data-start="497.35" data-end="500.21">and window.ContactsManager exists.</span> <span data-start="500.21" data-end="502.66">If not, the user will get redirected to a manual contact</span> <span data-start="502.66" data-end="504.43">entry form.</span> <span data-start="504.43" data-end="508.34">If it does, then the contact picker will be launched.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="802.23" data-end="805.71">To write a file, Sawyer first creates a writer</span> <span data-start="805.71" data-end="806.85">from the file handler.</span> <span data-start="806.85" data-end="809.01">This creates a temporary file.</span> <span data-start="809.01" data-end="811.29">And they write the contents to the temp file,</span> <span data-start="811.29" data-end="813.66">starting at the zeroth character and including</span> <span data-start="813.66" data-end="815.62">all of the content.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="856.82" data-end="859.692">With a folder open, Fuguedit's adapted</span> <span data-start="859.692" data-end="861.4">to include a folder tree of all the files</span> <span data-start="861.4" data-end="863.39">and folders in that directory.</span> <span data-start="863.39" data-end="865.36">Sawyer can now move around the folder tree,</span> <span data-start="865.36" data-end="867.85">opening files as they go.</span> <span data-start="867.85" data-end="871.3">Sawyer opens the README file and makes some edits.</span> <span data-start="871.3" data-end="875.49">This was edited from a PWA.</span> <span data-start="875.49" data-end="878.27">Sawyer then hits Control-S to save the file.</span> <span data-start="878.27" data-end="881.32">They get a notification telling them that if they agree,</span> <span data-start="881.32" data-end="883.98">Fuguedit's going to have write access to this file</span> <span data-start="883.98" data-end="885.81">until the tab's closed.</span> <span data-start="885.81" data-end="887.76">Again, an async block to ensure the user</span> <span data-start="887.76" data-end="889.26">doesn't accidentally give permission</span> <span data-start="889.26" data-end="891.52">to this functionality.</span> </p>
