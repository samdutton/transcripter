<p><span data-start="9.93" data-end="10.8">And you know what?</span> <span data-start="10.8" data-end="13.48">We've actually gone full circle with Dark Mode.</span> <span data-start="13.48" data-end="16.59">If you've used a computer in the 1970s or 1980s,</span> <span data-start="16.59" data-end="18.39">you probably have used Dark Mode before.</span> <span data-start="18.39" data-end="21.27">Well, Dark Mode became a thing.</span> <span data-start="21.27" data-end="23.82">At that time, when screens oftentimes were monochrome</span> <span data-start="23.82" data-end="26">and color screens incredibly expensive,</span> <span data-start="26" data-end="29.49">Dark Mode wasn't a choice but simply a fact.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="29.49" data-end="31.8">Only when color monitors became more affordable</span> <span data-start="31.8" data-end="35.01">and what you see is what you get desktop publishing evolved,</span> <span data-start="35.01" data-end="36.9">the idea of making a virtual document</span> <span data-start="36.9" data-end="40.59">resemble its physical printed end product became popular.</span> <span data-start="40.59" data-end="43.83">And this baseline assumption of dark text on light background</span> <span data-start="43.83" data-end="48.5">was carried over to the very first, earliest web designs.</span> <span data-start="48.5" data-end="50.66">The output of those heavy cathode ray tube</span> <span data-start="50.66" data-end="53.01">monitors with massive desktop PCs</span> <span data-start="53.01" data-end="56.37">that we consume these very first web pages on is long over.</span> <span data-start="56.37" data-end="58.32">And nowadays, more often than not,</span> <span data-start="58.32" data-end="61.11">we use mobile devices with light LCD displays</span> <span data-start="61.11" data-end="64.05">or AMOLED screens that also have enabled completely new usage</span> <span data-start="64.05" data-end="65.34">patterns.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="65.34" data-end="68.06">For example, I often browse the web while in bed.</span> <span data-start="68.06" data-end="69.63">And because it's easier on my eyes</span> <span data-start="69.63" data-end="71.94">and less likely to wake up my better half,</span> <span data-start="71.94" data-end="74.287">I tend to turn on my phone's Dark Mode.</span> <span data-start="74.287" data-end="76.62">I've done some user research on why people use Dark Mode</span> <span data-start="76.62" data-end="78.36">and under which circumstances.</span> <span data-start="78.36" data-end="80.19">The results are pretty interesting.</span> <span data-start="80.19" data-end="82.05">While the majority of the surveyed users</span> <span data-start="82.05" data-end="84.66">unsurprisingly said Dark Mode was easier on the eyes</span> <span data-start="84.66" data-end="86.85">and just looked beautiful and elegant,</span> <span data-start="86.85" data-end="89.34">the third most mentioned reason for using Dark Mode</span> <span data-start="89.34" data-end="90.81">was that it consumes less energy.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="95.52" data-end="97.15">The Android team have looked into this</span> <span data-start="97.15" data-end="98.93">and found out that on AMOLED screens,</span> <span data-start="98.93" data-end="101.71">Dark Mode can save up to 60% energy.</span> <span data-start="101.71" data-end="104.7">This is why on Android Q, when Battery Saver kicks in,</span> <span data-start="104.7" data-end="106.9">we automatically activate Dark Mode.</span> <span data-start="106.9" data-end="108.58">And finally, some people say they</span> <span data-start="108.58" data-end="111.31">require Dark Mode as a true accessibility tool,</span> <span data-start="111.31" data-end="114.44">without which they can't get their work done.</span> <span data-start="114.44" data-end="117.17">Interestingly, Dark Mode usage correlates less than expected</span> <span data-start="117.17" data-end="119.15">with the surrounding ambient light situation,</span> <span data-start="119.15" data-end="123.14">meaning a lot of people, like me, use Dark Mode permanently.</span> <span data-start="123.14" data-end="125.63">So how do you activate Dark Mode in the first place?</span> <span data-start="125.63" data-end="128.389">On Mac OS, it's a setting in the System Preferences</span> <span data-start="128.389" data-end="129.68">in the General section.</span> <span data-start="129.68" data-end="132.65">On iOS and iPAD OS, you can toggle Dark Mode in Settings</span> <span data-start="132.65" data-end="134.96">in the Display and Brightness section.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="134.96" data-end="137.51">On Android, Dark Mode is called Dark Theme.</span> <span data-start="137.51" data-end="139.01">And you can activate it in Settings</span> <span data-start="139.01" data-end="140.51">in the Display section.</span> <span data-start="140.51" data-end="142.91">For Windows, Dark Mode can be activated in Settings</span> <span data-start="142.91" data-end="146.22">in the Colors dropdown menu in the Personalization section.</span> <span data-start="146.22" data-end="148.7">And finally, for the various Linux distributions,</span> <span data-start="148.7" data-end="150.5">activating Dark Mode typically involves</span> <span data-start="150.5" data-end="152.71">setting a dark desktop theme.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="152.71" data-end="154.508">Now that we know how to enable dark Mode,</span> <span data-start="154.508" data-end="156.05">let's see how we can actually support</span> <span data-start="156.05" data-end="157.7">Dark Mode on our web pages.</span> <span data-start="157.7" data-end="159.68">The secret is a user reference media feature</span> <span data-start="159.68" data-end="161.45">called prefers-color-scheme.</span> <span data-start="161.45" data-end="163.22">It has three possible values — </span> <span data-start="163.22" data-end="166.01">dark, light, and no preference.</span> <span data-start="166.01" data-end="167.99">The simplest possible Dark Mode implementation</span> <span data-start="167.99" data-end="170.87">is to just invert the background and the foreground color</span> <span data-start="170.87" data-end="173.387">in the case the user prefers Dark Mode.</span> <span data-start="173.387" data-end="175.97">You can see how the page reacts when I toggle the MAC OS color</span> <span data-start="175.97" data-end="178.49">theme between light and dark.</span> <span data-start="178.49" data-end="180.77">Switching the entire operating system's color scheme</span> <span data-start="180.77" data-end="182.12">can get really annoying.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="182.12" data-end="183.64">So in Chrome Dev Tools, we now allow</span> <span data-start="183.64" data-end="186.65">you to emulate the user's preferred color scheme.</span> <span data-start="186.65" data-end="188.48">So back to the theme [INAUDIBLE].</span> <span data-start="188.48" data-end="191.025">While it works, already in this basic example,</span> <span data-start="191.025" data-end="192.65">you can see how in practice, things are</span> <span data-start="192.65" data-end="194.63">a lot more complex than that.</span> <span data-start="194.63" data-end="196.85">The default purple user agent stylesheet color</span> <span data-start="196.85" data-end="200.34">of a visited link has a contrast ratio of only 1.9,</span> <span data-start="200.34" data-end="201.78">which isn't enough.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="201.78" data-end="204.26">We can fix this by adding some [INAUDIBLE].</span> <span data-start="204.26" data-end="208.09">And now it slowly starts to look OK.</span> <span data-start="208.09" data-end="209.74">But you can see where this is headed.</span> <span data-start="209.74" data-end="212.38">For a production website, we'd have hundreds or even</span> <span data-start="212.38" data-end="215.78">thousands of cases like this that we'd need to cover.</span> <span data-start="215.78" data-end="218.59">So rather than one by one, we need something better,</span> <span data-start="218.59" data-end="220.8">semantic color definitions.</span> <span data-start="220.8" data-end="222.94">You can do this with CSS variables.</span> <span data-start="222.94" data-end="226.11">So instead of using hardcoded colors on the various elements,</span> <span data-start="226.11" data-end="229.51">we use variables like text color or background color</span> <span data-start="229.51" data-end="231.49">and then define these variables dynamically</span> <span data-start="231.49" data-end="234.58">based on a preferred color scheme.</span> <span data-start="234.58" data-end="236.98">As I said before, we're ready for the toy example.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="236.98" data-end="240.52">We need quite some CSS and even more for production web apps.</span> <span data-start="240.52" data-end="241.67">But here's the thing — </span> <span data-start="241.67" data-end="243.31">if you have Dark Mode enabled, you</span> <span data-start="243.31" data-end="246.46">shouldn't be forced to load CSS that is only relevant in Light</span> <span data-start="246.46" data-end="249.175">Mode and vice versa.</span> <span data-start="249.175" data-end="250.8">You can deal with this by splitting out</span> <span data-start="250.8" data-end="255.2">CSS into three files, dark.css that contains all the Dark Mode</span> <span data-start="255.2" data-end="258.459">relevant CSS variable definitions, light.css that</span> <span data-start="258.459" data-end="260.649">contains all the Light Mode relevant CSS variable</span> <span data-start="260.649" data-end="264.61">definitions, and style CSS that contains the common CSS where</span> <span data-start="264.61" data-end="266.28">these variables are being used.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="266.28" data-end="269.17">Like that, they make sure that in the critical rendering path,</span> <span data-start="269.17" data-end="271.78">only the CSS that's needed for the preferred color scheme</span> <span data-start="271.78" data-end="274.6">gets loaded with the highest priority and the rest</span> <span data-start="274.6" data-end="276.138">with the lowest priority.</span> <span data-start="276.138" data-end="278.68">If you have to deal with older browsers that don't understand</span> <span data-start="278.68" data-end="280.39">the prefers color scheme media query yet,</span> <span data-start="280.39" data-end="283.28">we require one last trick to make sure the default</span> <span data-start="283.28" data-end="286.24">CSS, for example, light.css gets downloaded</span> <span data-start="286.24" data-end="288.64">with highest priority.</span> <span data-start="288.64" data-end="291.61">Therefore, we manually insert the light.css stylesheet</span> <span data-start="291.61" data-end="294.64">with the good old insertAdjacentHTML method</span> <span data-start="294.64" data-end="297.97">to force its download with the highest priority.</span> <span data-start="297.97" data-end="300.182">The obvious [INAUDIBLE] is to make it work even</span> <span data-start="300.182" data-end="302.39">on browsers that are only compatible with [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span data-start="302.39" data-end="304.01">script 5.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="304.01" data-end="304.54">All right.</span> <span data-start="304.54" data-end="306.55">With all of this out of the way, let's have a look</span> <span data-start="306.55" data-end="308.41">at how you can actually design for Dark Mode</span> <span data-start="308.41" data-end="309.97">and what to keep in mind.</span> <span data-start="309.97" data-end="312.73">As we've seen before, getting all the contrasts right,</span> <span data-start="312.73" data-end="314.56">making sure the design conveys concepts</span> <span data-start="314.56" data-end="317.32">like elevation in both light and dark themes</span> <span data-start="317.32" data-end="319.48">and still incorporating your brand's colors</span> <span data-start="319.48" data-end="322.36">and accent colors is incredibly hard.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="322.36" data-end="324.58">Material design can help your design team bootstrap</span> <span data-start="324.58" data-end="327.34">a design that respects all the best practices material</span> <span data-start="327.34" data-end="328.66">has established.</span> <span data-start="328.66" data-end="331.93">On material.io, you can find a number of resources, including</span> <span data-start="331.93" data-end="334">a code lab to get you started.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="334" data-end="336.46">One last tip —  remember that not everyone who</span> <span data-start="336.46" data-end="338.83">has Dark Mode activated on their operating system</span> <span data-start="338.83" data-end="341.68">necessarily wants websites to be dark too.</span> <span data-start="341.68" data-end="343.42">It is a nice gesture to provide users</span> <span data-start="343.42" data-end="345.22">with a Dark Mode toggle for your site</span> <span data-start="345.22" data-end="347.71">that initially respects people's prefers-color-scheme</span> <span data-start="347.71" data-end="348.34">preference.</span> <span data-start="348.34" data-end="351.54">But then, I'll ask them to temporarily or even permanently</span> <span data-start="351.54" data-end="352.54">override it.</span> <span data-start="352.54" data-end="355.15">You can easily support this use case with a custom element</span> <span data-start="355.15" data-end="358.72">that we've developed right for this purpose, dark-mode-toggle.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="358.72" data-end="361.21">All you need to do is load the custom element script</span> <span data-start="361.21" data-end="362.8">and then include it on your page.</span> <span data-start="362.8" data-end="366.51">You can find out more about this custom element on GitHub.</span> <span data-start="366.51" data-end="368.98">And with that, thank you very much for watching.</span> <span data-start="368.98" data-end="371.19">You can find links to all the features, articles,</span> <span data-start="371.19" data-end="373.95">and code samples from this video in the description.</span> <span data-start="373.95" data-end="376.72">See you next time, and enjoy Dark Mode.</span> <span data-start="376.72" data-end="379.17">[MUSIC PLAYING]</span> </p>
