<p><span data-start="21.02" data-end="23.83">I want to show you that now machine learning in JavaScript</span> <span data-start="23.83" data-end="26.29">is real, powerful, and useful, and you can</span> <span data-start="26.29" data-end="29.42">do some amazing things with it.</span> <span data-start="29.42" data-end="32">Earlier this year, Google released its first ever</span> <span data-start="32" data-end="33.98">AI-powered Google Doodle.</span> <span data-start="33.98" data-end="36.98">In this, users could synthesize a Bach-style harmony</span> <span data-start="36.98" data-end="39.5">using a machine learning model running directly</span> <span data-start="39.5" data-end="40.88">in their browser.</span> <span data-start="40.88" data-end="43.49">So, in only three days, more than 50 million people</span> <span data-start="43.49" data-end="47.77">used this Doodle to create, save, and share their music.</span> <span data-start="47.77" data-end="49.61">A creative marketing team in Google</span> <span data-start="49.61" data-end="52.79">has built a fun, interactive experience where users</span> <span data-start="52.79" data-end="54.59">are shown a Zodiac symbol.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="54.59" data-end="56.63">And they try to match the shown animal</span> <span data-start="56.63" data-end="58.7">with a shadow of their hand, making</span> <span data-start="58.7" data-end="61.29">that character come to life.</span> <span data-start="61.29" data-end="64.25">Other teams are experimenting with novel ways of making</span> <span data-start="64.25" data-end="66.35">web interfaces more accessible.</span> <span data-start="66.35" data-end="68.27">In this example, here, on the bottom left,</span> <span data-start="68.27" data-end="71.54">called Create Ability, people can control web interfaces</span> <span data-start="71.54" data-end="74.54">with gesture such as playing a keyboard with their face</span> <span data-start="74.54" data-end="76.2">motion.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="76.2" data-end="78.84">All of these amazing examples have been made possible</span> <span data-start="78.84" data-end="80.4">by TensorFlow.js.</span> <span data-start="80.4" data-end="83.16">TensorFlow.js is an open source library for machine learning</span> <span data-start="83.16" data-end="84.39">and JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="84.39" data-end="86.58">It runs in a web browser and can also</span> <span data-start="86.58" data-end="89.31">be used server-side and on many other platforms that</span> <span data-start="89.31" data-end="91.37">support JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="91.37" data-end="93.35">You can use TensorFlow JavaScript in one</span> <span data-start="93.35" data-end="94.94">of three different ways.</span> <span data-start="94.94" data-end="96.86">You can run a pre-trained machine learning</span> <span data-start="96.86" data-end="98.81">model in your application.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="98.81" data-end="100.55">You can customize a pre-trained model</span> <span data-start="100.55" data-end="102.83">by retraining it on your own data.</span> <span data-start="102.83" data-end="104.69">Or you can use the lower-level ops</span> <span data-start="104.69" data-end="109.586">API to write a new model from scratch directly in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="109.586" data-end="112.28">There are many reasons why you may want to consider</span> <span data-start="112.28" data-end="114.35">using TensorFlow JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="114.35" data-end="117.11">First of all, it allows web application developers</span> <span data-start="117.11" data-end="120.08">and JavaScript developers to use machine learning directly</span> <span data-start="120.08" data-end="122.36">in their applications, and it's really easy</span> <span data-start="122.36" data-end="125.6">to get started and be up and running.</span> <span data-start="125.6" data-end="129.11">With only a few lines of code, you can load our library</span> <span data-start="129.11" data-end="130.979">and you can load a pre-trained model,</span> <span data-start="130.979" data-end="132.75">such as the body-pix model.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="132.75" data-end="135.59">And this is a model that allows you to do person segmentation</span> <span data-start="135.59" data-end="136.85">on an image.</span> <span data-start="136.85" data-end="138.77">You create an instance of the model,</span> <span data-start="138.77" data-end="141.44">and then you call its estimatePersonSegmentation</span> <span data-start="141.44" data-end="143.81">method on your selected image.</span> <span data-start="143.81" data-end="147.41">And you get back a JSON object, which contains the segmentation</span> <span data-start="147.41" data-end="151.31">mask, which can then be directly used in your application code.</span> <span data-start="151.31" data-end="152.408">That's all there is to it.</span> <span data-start="152.408" data-end="154.7">So in just a couple of minutes, you are up and running,</span> <span data-start="154.7" data-end="157.37">and you are using ML in your web application</span> <span data-start="157.37" data-end="160.01">without having to deal with concepts such as tensors,</span> <span data-start="160.01" data-end="162.77">optimizers, losses, et cetera.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="162.77" data-end="164.66">TensorFlow.js can be used client-side</span> <span data-start="164.66" data-end="167.73">in the browser and other browser-like platforms.</span> <span data-start="167.73" data-end="169.37">This has many advantages.</span> <span data-start="169.37" data-end="172.25">You get all the benefits of the interactivity of web</span> <span data-start="172.25" data-end="175.16">as a platform, and users can use directly</span> <span data-start="175.16" data-end="177.65">microphones and webcams and other sensors that</span> <span data-start="177.65" data-end="179.69">are attached to the browser.</span> <span data-start="179.69" data-end="181.59">Users don't need to install anything,</span> <span data-start="181.59" data-end="183.5">so your application becomes instantly</span> <span data-start="183.5" data-end="185.78">deployable and shareable.</span> <span data-start="185.78" data-end="189.11">Another big benefit is that user data stays client-site,</span> <span data-start="189.11" data-end="191.69">and this has very big implications for privacy,</span> <span data-start="191.69" data-end="194.45">for applications such as health care, for example.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="194.45" data-end="198.84">And it also helps reduce latency and server-side costs.</span> <span data-start="198.84" data-end="200.99">Finally, we support GPU acceleration</span> <span data-start="200.99" data-end="204.02">through WebGL, which gives it excellent performance out</span> <span data-start="204.02" data-end="205.93">of the box.</span> <span data-start="205.93" data-end="207.48">Although, in this talk, we are mainly</span> <span data-start="207.48" data-end="209.58">talking about browser use cases, I</span> <span data-start="209.58" data-end="211.62">should mention that TensorFlow.js can also</span> <span data-start="211.62" data-end="214.29">be used with Node.js server side,</span> <span data-start="214.29" data-end="216.96">and this is very useful for enterprise applications</span> <span data-start="216.96" data-end="219.32">when Node is heavily used.</span> <span data-start="219.32" data-end="222.89">So a natural question to ask is, how fast is it?</span> <span data-start="222.89" data-end="224.82">Well, it turns out it's really fast.</span> <span data-start="224.82" data-end="227.91">For example, on mobile devices running inference</span> <span data-start="227.91" data-end="229.95">with an image classification example using</span> <span data-start="229.95" data-end="233.46">the MobileNet v2 model, you get real-time performance</span> <span data-start="233.46" data-end="236.3">with 20 milliseconds inference time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="236.3" data-end="238.65">And on server side, we have performance parity</span> <span data-start="238.65" data-end="241.53">with Python-based TensorFlow.</span> <span data-start="241.53" data-end="243.91">So to help you get started, we have a collection</span> <span data-start="243.91" data-end="247.06">of pre-trained ML models for common ML problems</span> <span data-start="247.06" data-end="249.01">that we have prepackaged for you.</span> <span data-start="249.01" data-end="252.01">These include use cases such as image classification and object</span> <span data-start="252.01" data-end="255.1">detection, detecting human pose and gesture,</span> <span data-start="255.1" data-end="257.44">audio models for recognizing spoken words</span> <span data-start="257.44" data-end="259.81">and building speech command interfaces,</span> <span data-start="259.81" data-end="262.57">and text models for text classification, sentiment</span> <span data-start="262.57" data-end="265.45">analysis, toxicity detection, et cetera.</span> <span data-start="265.45" data-end="268.3">It's really easy to use any of these pre-trained models</span> <span data-start="268.3" data-end="271.27">with our high-level wrapped APIs from our hosted scripts,</span> <span data-start="271.27" data-end="275.1">or you could install from our NPM packages.</span> <span data-start="275.1" data-end="277.41">Using these models as building blocks,</span> <span data-start="277.41" data-end="280.92">applications can be built for a variety of use cases.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="280.92" data-end="283.92">These include things like accessibility, AR/VR</span> <span data-start="283.92" data-end="285.79">experiences such as virtual product</span> <span data-start="285.79" data-end="288.9">try-ons, conversational agents, and moderating</span> <span data-start="288.9" data-end="292.23">user-generated content on your websites.</span> <span data-start="292.23" data-end="295.71">So these pre-trained models are a great starting point.</span> <span data-start="295.71" data-end="297.51">Often, however, in real life, you</span> <span data-start="297.51" data-end="300.88">need to customize these models on your own data.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="300.88" data-end="303.09">So one way to do this is, again, by using</span> <span data-start="303.09" data-end="306.03">the power of TensorFlow running directly in the browser</span> <span data-start="306.03" data-end="310.45">interactively, and using that to train a model on your own data.</span> <span data-start="310.45" data-end="313.8">Let's take a look at how easy this is.</span> <span data-start="313.8" data-end="315.48">So in this demo, I will show you how</span> <span data-start="315.48" data-end="319.02">to use Teachable Machine to train a custom model.</span> <span data-start="319.02" data-end="321.78">So the MobileNet image classification model is already</span> <span data-start="321.78" data-end="323.84">running in this browser session, and we</span> <span data-start="323.84" data-end="325.92">will modify it to recognize symbols</span> <span data-start="325.92" data-end="328.03">for rock, paper, and scissors.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="328.03" data-end="331.32">So we're going to output the word rock for the first class,</span> <span data-start="331.32" data-end="334.05">we will output the word paper for the second class,</span> <span data-start="334.05" data-end="336.85">and we'll output scissors for the third class.</span> <span data-start="336.85" data-end="340">Now, let's record the training images for these three classes.</span> <span data-start="340" data-end="341.813">So, first, let's record images for rock.</span> <span data-start="341.813" data-end="343.23">So I'll hold up my hand like this.</span> </p>
