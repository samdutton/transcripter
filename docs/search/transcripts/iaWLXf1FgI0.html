<p><span data-start="85.53" data-end="87.14">So lab data, which is synthetically</span> <span data-start="87.14" data-end="89.69">collected in a reproducible testing environment,</span> <span data-start="89.69" data-end="92.84">is critical for tracking down bugs and diagnosing issues</span> <span data-start="92.84" data-end="94.49">before your users see them.</span> <span data-start="94.49" data-end="96.95">But field data allows you to understand</span> <span data-start="96.95" data-end="100.19">what real-world users are actually experiencing,</span> <span data-start="100.19" data-end="102.29">conditions that are kind of impossible to simulate</span> <span data-start="102.29" data-end="103.82">in the real lab.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="103.82" data-end="107.63">The real world is messy with permutations of devices,</span> <span data-start="107.63" data-end="109.61">networks, cache conditions.</span> <span data-start="109.61" data-end="111.08">The list goes on and on.</span> <span data-start="111.08" data-end="113.572">Either set of metrics taken in isolation</span> <span data-start="113.572" data-end="115.28">aren't nearly as powerful as when they're</span> <span data-start="115.28" data-end="117.105">taken together and combined.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="117.105" data-end="119.48"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: So you have easy access to both lab and field</span> <span data-start="119.48" data-end="122.78">data in tools like Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights, Chrome UX</span> <span data-start="122.78" data-end="124.58">Report, Search Console.</span> <span data-start="124.58" data-end="126.8">So these tools allow for local measurement as well as</span> <span data-start="126.8" data-end="128.467">production monitoring, which we're going</span> <span data-start="128.467" data-end="129.902">to get more into in a bit.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="129.902" data-end="131.86"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: One thing I wanted to address</span> <span data-start="131.86" data-end="133.9">was why metrics change.</span> <span data-start="133.9" data-end="136.06">As we know, there are a lot of different aspects</span> <span data-start="136.06" data-end="139.27">of performance that can frustrate or delight a user — </span> <span data-start="139.27" data-end="143.11">you know, waiting, uncertainty, hipster pineapples.</span> <span data-start="143.11" data-end="145.09">OK, hipster pineapples are great,</span> <span data-start="145.09" data-end="147.83">but things that take them away from me are not great.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="147.83" data-end="151.48">So without having a clear way to accurately measure</span> <span data-start="151.48" data-end="153.71">the nuances of users' experience,</span> <span data-start="153.71" data-end="156.16">it isn't really possible to quantify the impact that they</span> <span data-start="156.16" data-end="158.17">have on your bottom line or track improvements</span> <span data-start="158.17" data-end="159.13">and regressions.</span> <span data-start="159.13" data-end="161.41">That means we need to have our metrics evolve</span> <span data-start="161.41" data-end="164.47">as our understanding and ability to measure user experience</span> <span data-start="164.47" data-end="166">develops.</span> <span data-start="166" data-end="168.34">Here is where our metrics have been.</span> <span data-start="168.34" data-end="169.99">Across lab and field, we're trying</span> <span data-start="169.99" data-end="172.75">to capture load holistically as well</span> <span data-start="172.75" data-end="174.82">as the interactivity of a page.</span> <span data-start="174.82" data-end="176.62">But there are gaps.</span> <span data-start="176.62" data-end="178.87">And there are opportunities to more accurately</span> <span data-start="178.87" data-end="181.908">and comprehensively represent a user's experience.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="181.908" data-end="184.45">So you can remember when we used to focus on metrics like DOM</span> <span data-start="184.45" data-end="186.07">content loaded or on load.</span> <span data-start="186.07" data-end="189.19">They were measuring very technical aspects of a page,</span> <span data-start="189.19" data-end="191.377">like when a DOM tree was fully constructed.</span> <span data-start="191.377" data-end="193.21">And they don't necessarily correlate to what</span> <span data-start="193.21" data-end="195.8">a user actually experiences.</span> <span data-start="195.8" data-end="197.74">And as we evolve our metrics story,</span> <span data-start="197.74" data-end="200.41">we want to fill in as many gaps of our measurement of user</span> <span data-start="200.41" data-end="202.36">experience as we can.</span> <span data-start="202.36" data-end="204.86">There are a few major shifts here that I'd like to call out.</span> <span data-start="204.86" data-end="207.73">The first one is the reduced emphasis on First Meaningful</span> <span data-start="207.73" data-end="211.24">Paint and First CPU Idle We're excited to have metrics</span> <span data-start="211.24" data-end="214.81">available that better capture when a page feels usable, which</span> <span data-start="214.81" data-end="216.94">leads me to the second major call-out, which is</span> <span data-start="216.94" data-end="218.8">the new metrics you see added.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="218.8" data-end="220.42">Now at I/O this year, Paul and I did</span> <span data-start="220.42" data-end="222.745">share that they were —  these metrics were coming,</span> <span data-start="222.745" data-end="223.87">and they were on their way.</span> <span data-start="223.87" data-end="225.16">But now they're here.</span> <span data-start="225.16" data-end="228.25">So Largest Contentful Paint, Total Blocking Time,</span> <span data-start="228.25" data-end="231.16">and Cumulative Layout Shift are all out and available.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="231.16" data-end="233.02">These new metrics help to fill some</span> <span data-start="233.02" data-end="234.85">of the gaps in our measurement story.</span> <span data-start="234.85" data-end="236.83">For instance, when time to interactive</span> <span data-start="236.83" data-end="240.25">does a good job of identifying when the main thread calms down</span> <span data-start="240.25" data-end="242.26">later in load, total blocking time</span> <span data-start="242.26" data-end="245.08">aims to quantify how strained the main thread is</span> <span data-start="245.08" data-end="246.37">throughout the load.</span> <span data-start="246.37" data-end="250.25">So they complement each other and provide that balance.</span> <span data-start="250.25" data-end="252.61">So let's explore the new metrics themselves.</span> <span data-start="252.61" data-end="255.91">Largest Contentful Paint aims to measure exactly what its name</span> <span data-start="255.91" data-end="258.01">sounds like, what is the main largest</span> <span data-start="258.01" data-end="259.81">content visible for the user?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="259.81" data-end="260.8">When is it?</span> <span data-start="260.8" data-end="262.87">Metrics like First Contentful Paint are helpful,</span> <span data-start="262.87" data-end="264.58">but they only capture the very beginning</span> <span data-start="264.58" data-end="265.6">of a loading experience.</span> <span data-start="265.6" data-end="268.33">And LCP helps to flesh out how quickly a user is</span> <span data-start="268.33" data-end="271.64">able to see the meat of what they expect and want on a page.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="271.64" data-end="274.18">So yay, I expect to see my dog, Annie.</span> <span data-start="274.18" data-end="275.41">It's actually my dog.</span> <span data-start="275.41" data-end="278.53">And so as soon as I can see her entire cute, little face,</span> <span data-start="278.53" data-end="281.52">that's the value of my LCP.</span> <span data-start="281.52" data-end="282.432">Then there's this.</span> <span data-start="282.432" data-end="284.14">It's def as not as cute as my dog, is it?</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="284.36" data-end="285.57"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: No, not as cute.</span> <span data-start="285.57" data-end="287.487">Just a few pixels moving can be the difference</span> <span data-start="287.487" data-end="290.29">between happiness and complete mayhem.</span> <span data-start="290.29" data-end="293.37">So Cumulative Layout Shift measures an aspect of users' — </span> <span data-start="293.37" data-end="296.53">of a user experience that we're excited to build out over time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="296.53" data-end="300.51">In addition to our load and interactivity metrics.</span> <span data-start="300.51" data-end="304.19">And that's predictability.</span> <span data-start="304.19" data-end="306.2">Cumulative Layout Shift measures the amount</span> <span data-start="306.2" data-end="308.03">that the elements within the viewport move</span> <span data-start="308.03" data-end="310.82">around during load CLS is trying to measure things</span> <span data-start="310.82" data-end="313.85">like prepending and add to a list in a way that increases</span> <span data-start="313.85" data-end="316.61">the chances of accidental clicks like this one,</span> <span data-start="316.61" data-end="320.93">or having a new page in which the story's photos shifts down</span> <span data-start="320.93" data-end="323.4">the page when it fully loads, all that kind of stuff.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="323.4" data-end="324.59"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: All right, so that brings us</span> <span data-start="324.59" data-end="325.548">to Total Blocking Time.</span> <span data-start="325.548" data-end="327.007">I'm going to take a second on this.</span> <span data-start="327.007" data-end="328.58">And we need to do a quick refresher</span> <span data-start="328.58" data-end="331.892">on how event handling happens in the browser.</span> <span data-start="331.892" data-end="333.35">So let's say we have a main thread,</span> <span data-start="333.35" data-end="336.56">and then the user taps on a button, right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="336.56" data-end="337.72">So we have some input.</span> <span data-start="337.72" data-end="339.75">Now JavaScript has to react to that.</span> <span data-start="339.75" data-end="342.96">So we have an event handler, touch start, click handler,</span> <span data-start="342.96" data-end="344.38">whatever, some JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="344.38" data-end="346.68">Then we're going to have recalculate styles, layout,</span> <span data-start="346.68" data-end="347.18">paint.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="347.18" data-end="348.78">We ship a frame.</span> <span data-start="348.78" data-end="352.22">So that's just kind of the basic, normal flow.</span> <span data-start="352.22" data-end="353.93">But let's say that we take a main thread,</span> <span data-start="353.93" data-end="355.91">and there's something happening on it already,</span> <span data-start="355.91" data-end="358.37">just some JavaScript that's doing things.</span> <span data-start="358.37" data-end="361.34">And then, but the user still clicks on that button</span> <span data-start="361.34" data-end="362.9">in the middle of that task.</span> <span data-start="362.9" data-end="366.95">Well, in that case, we have to kind of wait a bit.</span> <span data-start="366.95" data-end="370.46">And then we can do the event handling and ship the frame.</span> <span data-start="370.46" data-end="372.98">But so there's this delay here, this input</span> <span data-start="372.98" data-end="374.67">delay where we're waiting.</span> <span data-start="374.67" data-end="376.908">Of course, if it's just a little bit of input delay,</span> <span data-start="376.908" data-end="378.2">the user shouldn't even notice.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="378.2" data-end="381.08">And a little bit would probably be about 50 milliseconds.</span> <span data-start="381.08" data-end="384.09">Up to that, user won't even pay attention.</span> <span data-start="384.09" data-end="388.16">But if it's over that, the user is going to start to notice.</span> <span data-start="388.16" data-end="389.75">So what we're interested in here is</span> <span data-start="389.75" data-end="395.66">kind of quantifying that risk of how much this long task might</span> <span data-start="395.66" data-end="398.36">potentially impact any sort of user interaction</span> <span data-start="398.36" data-end="400.62">that could come along at any time.</span> <span data-start="400.62" data-end="402.52">So if we zoom in — </span> <span data-start="402.52" data-end="405.93">and let's take this task.</span> <span data-start="405.93" data-end="408.51">So it's 150 milliseconds long.</span> <span data-start="408.51" data-end="410.955">So basically, the first 50 milliseconds,</span> <span data-start="410.955" data-end="411.83">it's going to freeze.</span> <span data-start="411.83" data-end="414.98">Because if all your tasks are under 50 milliseconds,</span> <span data-start="414.98" data-end="415.49">you're good.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="415.49" data-end="416.41">No problem.</span> <span data-start="416.41" data-end="418.265">But once we get above that, it's a problem.</span> <span data-start="418.265" data-end="421.47">So the 100 milliseconds at the end,</span> <span data-start="421.47" data-end="423.92">we call this blocking time.</span> <span data-start="423.92" data-end="425.78">So Total Blocking Time, basically,</span> <span data-start="425.78" data-end="428.25">if we take a main thread that looks like this,</span> <span data-start="428.25" data-end="433.61">we have 270 milliseconds, in total, of tasks on main thread.</span> <span data-start="433.61" data-end="436.04">And 60 milliseconds of that surpasses</span> <span data-start="436.04" data-end="438.66">that 50-millisecond overage.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="438.66" data-end="440.51">So that's our Total Blocking Time.</span> <span data-start="440.51" data-end="445.82">So the TBT is just the blocking time summed up,</span> <span data-start="445.82" data-end="447.83">all of it between the First Contentful Paint</span> <span data-start="447.83" data-end="449.1">and the Time To Interactive.</span> <span data-start="449.1" data-end="451.48">That's TBT.</span> <span data-start="451.48" data-end="453.89">OK, so we covered a few metrics.</span> <span data-start="453.89" data-end="456.32">They're available in various places.</span> <span data-start="456.32" data-end="461.75">Pretty much all the lab metrics are available in Lighthouse.</span> <span data-start="461.75" data-end="465.765">First Input Delay only really makes sense in the field.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="465.765" data-end="467.39">So then when it comes to field metrics,</span> <span data-start="467.39" data-end="470.57">you can see most of them are available in Chrome UX Report.</span> <span data-start="470.57" data-end="472.64">[INAUDIBLE] them, you can collect yourself</span> <span data-start="472.64" data-end="474.5">with the Performance Observer.</span> <span data-start="474.5" data-end="477.25">And you can check out, actually, the documentation for all this</span> <span data-start="477.25" data-end="480.09">in web.dev/metrics, brand-new landing page,</span> <span data-start="480.09" data-end="482.6">which summarizes all these metrics and also how to measure</span> <span data-start="482.6" data-end="484.11">them yourself.</span> <span data-start="484.11" data-end="485.37">Cool.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="512.33" data-end="515.07">But we're going to ship roughly in January.</span> <span data-start="515.07" data-end="517.58">This is what the current v5 score looks like.</span> <span data-start="517.58" data-end="521.21">It has five metrics that are weighted and blended together</span> <span data-start="521.21" data-end="523.64">to form the 0 to 100 performance score that you</span> <span data-start="523.64" data-end="526.89">see then populated in the gauge at the top of the report.</span> <span data-start="526.89" data-end="529.34">The new v6 score that we're working on now</span> <span data-start="529.34" data-end="533.33">replaces First CPU Idle and First Meaningful</span> <span data-start="533.33" data-end="536.82">Paint with Largest Contentful Paint and Total Blocking Time.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="552.72" data-end="554.53"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: It took us hours.</span> <span data-start="554.53" data-end="557.22">You can see that we aren't just updating the metrics to reflect</span> <span data-start="557.22" data-end="560.04">TBT and LCP, but we're also adjusting the weights</span> <span data-start="560.04" data-end="562.05">to be more balanced between phases of load</span> <span data-start="562.05" data-end="563.88">as well as interactivity measures.</span> <span data-start="563.88" data-end="566.32">Cumulative Layout Shift is still being finessed,</span> <span data-start="566.32" data-end="569.367">but we plan to incorporate it eventually.</span> <span data-start="569.367" data-end="571.2">So let's jump right into some of the tactics</span> <span data-start="571.2" data-end="572.7">to actually improve these metrics.</span> <span data-start="572.7" data-end="575.283">Just a quick, cool new feature in the interest of allowing you</span> <span data-start="575.283" data-end="578.35">to measure the user's experience as accurately as possible,</span> <span data-start="578.35" data-end="580.83">we've added a reanalyzed prompt to PageSpeed Insights.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="580.83" data-end="583.83"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: So for sites that are redirected to a new URL,</span> <span data-start="583.83" data-end="586.23">you're prompted to rerun the report</span> <span data-start="586.23" data-end="587.85">on that post-redirect URL.</span> <span data-start="587.85" data-end="589.53">So you get a full, accurate picture</span> <span data-start="589.53" data-end="593.35">of, OK, from the redirect, what is the story of that page.</span> <span data-start="593.35" data-end="596.22">So you can go to the PageSpeed Insights report to benchmark.</span> <span data-start="596.22" data-end="597.82">It's a great place to start.</span> <span data-start="597.82" data-end="599.43">But we also want to know how things</span> <span data-start="599.43" data-end="603">work over a historical perspective</span> <span data-start="603" data-end="605.32">and see what the trends are.</span> <span data-start="605.32" data-end="609.04">So the PageSpeed Insights API itself,</span> <span data-start="609.04" data-end="611.32">that is underlying the web app.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="611.32" data-end="613.36">And it's free to use and allows you</span> <span data-start="613.36" data-end="616.3">to scale up your monitoring across multiple pages</span> <span data-start="616.3" data-end="617.3">and domains.</span> <span data-start="617.3" data-end="619.81">And the cool thing is you can just hook it up to a Cron job,</span> <span data-start="619.81" data-end="622.63">ping it daily, drop the results the Google Sheets,</span> <span data-start="622.63" data-end="623.35">and chart it.</span> <span data-start="623.35" data-end="626.35">And I actually did that here with web.dev.</span> <span data-start="626.35" data-end="629.38">Was able just to do that, a lot of conditional formatting.</span> <span data-start="629.38" data-end="631.75">Love conditional formatting.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="631.75" data-end="633.52">And then got these charts, right.</span> <span data-start="633.52" data-end="635.95">And so this is actually like two weeks of data</span> <span data-start="635.95" data-end="639.77">from web.dev homepage collected by PageSpeed Insights,</span> <span data-start="639.77" data-end="643.69">the homepage, and then also one of the articles that I found.</span> <span data-start="643.69" data-end="646.39">So interestingly, First Contentful Paint</span> <span data-start="646.39" data-end="647.74">is about the same in both cases.</span> <span data-start="647.74" data-end="650.11">But then the speed index and TTI are quite</span> <span data-start="650.11" data-end="652.14">a bit higher on the article.</span> <span data-start="652.14" data-end="653.57">Like, the homepage is fast —  cool.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="655.6" data-end="657.267"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: Yeah, we'll go back to this.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="657.267" data-end="658.55"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: OK, cool.</span> <span data-start="658.55" data-end="660.04">So it's exciting to see what our partners have</span> <span data-start="660.04" data-end="662.17">been able to do with the production monitoring</span> <span data-start="662.17" data-end="664.965">capabilities that the PSI API offers.</span> <span data-start="664.965" data-end="666.34">This is a snapshot of a dashboard</span> <span data-start="666.34" data-end="668.34">that VRBO created with the API.</span> <span data-start="668.34" data-end="670.84">And they're able to track their long-term performance trends</span> <span data-start="670.84" data-end="673.45">and ensure that their page speed performance remains on par</span> <span data-start="673.45" data-end="675.985">or better within the travel industry.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="675.985" data-end="677.86">Another way to track and improve your metrics</span> <span data-start="677.86" data-end="680.53">is with Search Console's new speed report.</span> <span data-start="680.53" data-end="682.673">It was just formally announced lock last week,</span> <span data-start="682.673" data-end="683.59">which is kind of cool.</span> <span data-start="683.59" data-end="684.73">The speed report allows you to get</span> <span data-start="684.73" data-end="686.71">a sense of your overall status of the site</span> <span data-start="686.71" data-end="689.59">and is powered by data collected from the Chrome User Experience</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="689.59" data-end="690.43">Report.</span> <span data-start="690.43" data-end="692.68">You're able to then go to PageSpeed Insights</span> <span data-start="692.68" data-end="694.78">to get the actionable recommendations that are</span> <span data-start="694.78" data-end="697.18">surfaced in the speed report.</span> <span data-start="697.18" data-end="700.39">And we're making it rain with origin coverage.</span> <span data-start="700.39" data-end="701.89">OK, yeah, it's a stretch, but I had</span> <span data-start="701.89" data-end="703.42">to find a reason to use this.</span> <span data-start="703.42" data-end="707.5">Because, oh my god, it's a plug, and money, and pink.</span> <span data-start="707.5" data-end="708.53">Come on.</span> <span data-start="708.53" data-end="710.59">But, OK, in all seriousness, every time</span> <span data-start="710.59" data-end="713.56">Paul and I get up here and do a talk,</span> <span data-start="713.56" data-end="715.72">the CrUX team has done an amazing job and expanded</span> <span data-start="715.72" data-end="717.59">coverage to even more origins.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="717.59" data-end="720.642">So typically, about a million jump every time.</span> <span data-start="720.642" data-end="721.6">That's really exciting.</span> <span data-start="721.6" data-end="723.378">It does provide us with the ability</span> <span data-start="723.378" data-end="725.92">to better understand the current state of the web in a really</span> <span data-start="725.92" data-end="727.72">comprehensive way.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="727.72" data-end="729.1"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: And as of this month,</span> <span data-start="729.1" data-end="731.75">we made the change the Lighthouse Chrome extension.</span> <span data-start="731.75" data-end="735.13">So it will no longer run locally on your machine.</span> <span data-start="735.13" data-end="736.75">Instead, you'll just hit a button.</span> <span data-start="736.75" data-end="739.48">And it's going to go ping the API PageSpeed Insights</span> <span data-start="739.48" data-end="741.695">and run on our infrastructure instead.</span> <span data-start="741.695" data-end="743.32">If, of course, you're testing something</span> <span data-start="743.32" data-end="745.57">on localhost or something that's not publicly accessible,</span> <span data-start="745.57" data-end="747.97">then just open up DevTools and run it in the Audits panel</span> <span data-start="747.97" data-end="750.6">instead.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="750.6" data-end="754.53">I wanted to briefly touch on the reproducibility of Lighthouse</span> <span data-start="754.53" data-end="755.32">numbers.</span> <span data-start="755.32" data-end="757.71">So you might have noticed that they change sometimes.</span> <span data-start="757.71" data-end="760.47">And we see this as two separate concerns.</span> <span data-start="760.47" data-end="763.53">So first, running Lighthouse for the same page</span> <span data-start="763.53" data-end="765.39">in different environments —  say, like,</span> <span data-start="765.39" data-end="768.71">DevTools, PageSpeed Insights, Lighthouse on web page test,</span> <span data-start="768.71" data-end="770.8">you might end up with different results.</span> <span data-start="770.8" data-end="772.89">So we are investigating a calibration method</span> <span data-start="772.89" data-end="775.66">that might be able to mitigate this somewhat.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="775.66" data-end="777.84">But in general, I'd say it's fair to expect</span> <span data-start="777.84" data-end="779.85">that different conditions and hardware will</span> <span data-start="779.85" data-end="782.55">lead to different measurements for now.</span> <span data-start="782.55" data-end="784.36">So variability, on the other hand,</span> <span data-start="784.36" data-end="785.94">is the issue when you see numbers,</span> <span data-start="785.94" data-end="787.773">and they're moving around even though you're</span> <span data-start="787.773" data-end="789.28">on the exact same environment.</span> <span data-start="789.28" data-end="791.49">So this is a hard problem that all engineering</span> <span data-start="791.49" data-end="794.63">teams that measure performance struggle with.</span> <span data-start="794.63" data-end="797.46">We're always working to mitigate variability when we can.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="797.46" data-end="799.36">And while we have more work to do,</span> <span data-start="799.36" data-end="802.14">we're sharing some documentation on the sources of variability</span> <span data-start="802.14" data-end="806.63">and suggestions with what your team can do to implement them.</span> <span data-start="806.63" data-end="810.28">OK, so now we're on to how Lighthouse can be expanded</span> <span data-start="810.28" data-end="812.05">and extended as a platform.</span> <span data-start="812.05" data-end="814.66">So we want to make sure that Lighthouse is tailored</span> <span data-start="814.66" data-end="815.98">and actionable for you.</span> <span data-start="815.98" data-end="817.79">So we're making a few — </span> <span data-start="817.79" data-end="820.57">going to take a few minutes to talk about how you can leverage</span> <span data-start="820.57" data-end="822.602">it for your own use cases.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="822.602" data-end="824.56"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: So there are two primary ways</span> <span data-start="824.56" data-end="826.24">that you can build on top of Lighthouse</span> <span data-start="826.24" data-end="828.07">depending on what your goals are.</span> <span data-start="828.07" data-end="830.23">The first is with stack packs.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="834.45" data-end="835.64"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: Thank you.</span> <span data-start="835.64" data-end="837.31">Stack packs is a feature that allows</span> <span data-start="837.31" data-end="839.11">for stack-specific advice to be served</span> <span data-start="839.11" data-end="840.507">within the report itself.</span> <span data-start="840.507" data-end="842.59">So Lighthouse automatically detects whether or not</span> <span data-start="842.59" data-end="844.26">you're on a CMS or using a framework.</span> <span data-start="844.26" data-end="846.01">And then it will provide you with guidance</span> <span data-start="846.01" data-end="847.75">that is specific to your stack.</span> <span data-start="847.75" data-end="850.96">These stack packs take the core audits of the Lighthouse report</span> <span data-start="850.96" data-end="853.75">and layer customized recommendations on top of them</span> <span data-start="853.75" data-end="856.53">that are curated by community experts that know the CMSs</span> <span data-start="856.53" data-end="857.59">and frameworks.</span> <span data-start="857.59" data-end="860.08">We're excited to be launching stack packs with frameworks</span> <span data-start="860.08" data-end="863.32">and CMSs like Angular, WordPress, Magento, React,</span> <span data-start="863.32" data-end="864.17">and AMP.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="864.17" data-end="866.23">We're actively wanting to encourage</span> <span data-start="866.23" data-end="868.69">you to create a stack pack.</span> <span data-start="868.69" data-end="871.418">So please do check out the repo and work with us on it.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="871.418" data-end="873.96"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: So the second way that Lighthouse can be extended</span> <span data-start="873.96" data-end="875.05">is plugins.</span> <span data-start="875.05" data-end="878.02">So Elizabeth and I announced them earlier this year</span> <span data-start="878.02" data-end="880.78">at Google I/O. We're excited to see the community</span> <span data-start="880.78" data-end="882.21">start to build their own.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="882.21" data-end="883.96"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: Yeah, so let's just take</span> <span data-start="883.96" data-end="885.55">a second to kind of refresh our memory</span> <span data-start="885.55" data-end="887.088">on the impetus behind plugins.</span> <span data-start="887.088" data-end="889.63">There's a lot of quality checks that aren't currently covered</span> <span data-start="889.63" data-end="891.22">by Lighthouse core audits, and that's</span> <span data-start="891.22" data-end="892.58">for a few different reasons.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="892.58" data-end="894.91">One is that we want core Lighthouse audits</span> <span data-start="894.91" data-end="897.73">to make sure that they're applicable to all web</span> <span data-start="897.73" data-end="898.72">developers.</span> <span data-start="898.72" data-end="902.08">There may be really great audits for an e-commerce checkout</span> <span data-start="902.08" data-end="904.39">page, for instance, patterns that you definitely</span> <span data-start="904.39" data-end="905.32">want to follow.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="905.32" data-end="907.843">But those checks wouldn't be relevant for everybody.</span> <span data-start="907.843" data-end="909.76">There are also a lot of really valuable audits</span> <span data-start="909.76" data-end="911.858">that are relevant to all web developers,</span> <span data-start="911.858" data-end="913.9">but the Lighthouse team just hasn't gotten around</span> <span data-start="913.9" data-end="915.37">to doing them yet.</span> <span data-start="915.37" data-end="917.6">So this is where Lighthouse plugins come in.</span> <span data-start="917.6" data-end="919.81">They allow you to implement a new set of checks</span> <span data-start="919.81" data-end="921.82">that will be run by Lighthouse and added</span> <span data-start="921.82" data-end="924.46">to the report as an entirely new category.</span> <span data-start="924.46" data-end="925.99">Whenever Lighthouse loads a page,</span> <span data-start="925.99" data-end="927.79">it collects a bunch of great stuff,</span> <span data-start="927.79" data-end="930.58">and all sorts of data about its elements, network records,</span> <span data-start="930.58" data-end="931.6">and just so much more.</span> <span data-start="931.6" data-end="932.96">It's a complete wealth.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="932.96" data-end="935.41">So these artifacts can be leveraged for plugins.</span> <span data-start="935.41" data-end="937.67">Once you know what data is available to you,</span> <span data-start="937.67" data-end="940.57">you can think through what your goal is for creating a plugin</span> <span data-start="940.57" data-end="942.97">and how actionable, consistent, and valuable it</span> <span data-start="942.97" data-end="944.44">would be for a user to be presented</span> <span data-start="944.44" data-end="945.64">with that information.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="989.98" data-end="990.51"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: I didn't.</span> <span data-start="990.51" data-end="990.85">I didn't.</span> <span data-start="990.85" data-end="991.48">I'm scared.</span> <span data-start="991.48" data-end="992.78">It would be a lot more.</span> <span data-start="992.78" data-end="996.62">So that's not the best.</span> <span data-start="996.62" data-end="999.2">There's a few people that have looked into this too.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="999.2" data-end="1002.67">And the quick hack is essentially, well, you just</span> <span data-start="1002.67" data-end="1007.08">take the thumbnail image and put a red play button on it, just</span> <span data-start="1007.08" data-end="1008.07">ones that you created.</span> <span data-start="1008.07" data-end="1009.57">And then when the user clicks on it,</span> <span data-start="1009.57" data-end="1012.45">just throw the iframe in there and have it AutoPlay — </span> <span data-start="1012.45" data-end="1014.16">kind of straightforward.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1014.16" data-end="1017.55">So anyways, I made a stupid little custom element</span> <span data-start="1017.55" data-end="1019.89">that does the exact same thing, really straightforward.</span> <span data-start="1019.89" data-end="1024.089">And the nice thing is it takes 500 milliseconds of main thread</span> <span data-start="1024.089" data-end="1031.319">time down to zero and, what is it, 600k of network activity</span> <span data-start="1031.319" data-end="1033.16">down to 1 — </span> <span data-start="1033.16" data-end="1034.869">so a nice overall win.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1034.869" data-end="1037.29">So let's turn —  let's write a plugin</span> <span data-start="1037.29" data-end="1042.03">that just identifies these normal costly iframe embeds.</span> <span data-start="1042.03" data-end="1044.04">So it's basically we start out with this.</span> <span data-start="1044.04" data-end="1045.036">We just name it.</span> <span data-start="1045.036" data-end="1047.369">And the only important thing here is required artifacts.</span> <span data-start="1047.369" data-end="1049.32">So we're just saying, OK, Lighthouse,</span> <span data-start="1049.32" data-end="1051.813">we want the data about iframe elements.</span> <span data-start="1051.813" data-end="1053.23">And we're going to work with that.</span> <span data-start="1053.23" data-end="1055.77">So the actual implementation's here.</span> <span data-start="1055.77" data-end="1058.02">We take that iframe element's artifact,</span> <span data-start="1058.02" data-end="1059.075">and we just look it over.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1059.075" data-end="1060.45">And basically, we're just looking</span> <span data-start="1060.45" data-end="1063.18">to see where it's coming from YouTube.</span> <span data-start="1063.18" data-end="1064.17">That's roughly it.</span> <span data-start="1064.17" data-end="1065.628">And we're essentially going to fail</span> <span data-start="1065.628" data-end="1068.31">the audit if we find iframes.</span> <span data-start="1068.31" data-end="1071.64">Otherwise we'll pass it, because we're good.</span> <span data-start="1071.64" data-end="1074.268">In a plugin, you can then decide how you want to score things.</span> <span data-start="1074.268" data-end="1075.56">Because it's your own category.</span> <span data-start="1075.56" data-end="1076.825">You have a 0 to 100 score.</span> <span data-start="1076.825" data-end="1078.45">You can decide how things are weighted.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1078.45" data-end="1080.73">You have a lot of control there.</span> <span data-start="1080.73" data-end="1081.93">We did this, packaged it up.</span> <span data-start="1081.93" data-end="1084.87">It's a really straightforward and small little plugin.</span> <span data-start="1084.87" data-end="1088.27">And you get a nice —  this is a failure state, of course.</span> <span data-start="1088.27" data-end="1092.5">But easy enough to just identify, OK, yeah,</span> <span data-start="1092.5" data-end="1094.48">there's a YouTube embed here on the page.</span> <span data-start="1094.48" data-end="1095.64">It's not optimized.</span> <span data-start="1095.64" data-end="1097.98">We should probably go implement it.</span> <span data-start="1097.98" data-end="1101.97">So I ran it against web.dev, found the failure.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1101.97" data-end="1103.83">And then I was like, well, let's just</span> <span data-start="1103.83" data-end="1108.18">apply my little custom element hack to the page</span> <span data-start="1108.18" data-end="1110.73">and make it faster —  not 400 times,</span> <span data-start="1110.73" data-end="1112.67">I mean, but faster probably.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1115.13" data-end="1116.85"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: And that works really well.</span> <span data-start="1116.85" data-end="1119.43">I feel confident about it being a much better thing</span> <span data-start="1119.43" data-end="1121.18">for the page.</span> <span data-start="1121.18" data-end="1122.88">But at the same time — </span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1125.4" data-end="1126.942"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: But we need to make</span> <span data-start="1126.942" data-end="1129.475">sure that the plugin and the light YouTube embed is — </span> <span data-start="1129.475" data-end="1131.46">that the fix is viable and sustainable,</span> <span data-start="1131.46" data-end="1133.87">and we can show that to our teams.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1133.87" data-end="1136.35"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: So — </span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1136.35" data-end="1138.85"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: And so that's when Lighthouse CI comes in.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1138.85" data-end="1139.558"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: Yeah.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1139.558" data-end="1142.29"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: So you can now run Lighthouse on every commit</span> <span data-start="1142.29" data-end="1143.54">before you push to production.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1143.54" data-end="1144.248"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: Yeah.</span> <span data-start="1144.248" data-end="1146.17">And so we really want to be able to provide</span> <span data-start="1146.17" data-end="1148.09">that kind of confidence for the entire team</span> <span data-start="1148.09" data-end="1149.007">and that transparency.</span> <span data-start="1149.007" data-end="1151.48">So for every single pull request, what sort of change</span> <span data-start="1151.48" data-end="1154.42">are we looking at here?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1154.42" data-end="1158.253">So a brief architectural look —  so inside your CI</span> <span data-start="1158.253" data-end="1160.42">where you're doing your unit tests and your linting,</span> <span data-start="1160.42" data-end="1161.795">you can run the collection agent.</span> <span data-start="1161.795" data-end="1163.87">So essentially, it's just going to run Lighthouse</span> <span data-start="1163.87" data-end="1166.703">a few times for each URL that you're interested in.</span> <span data-start="1166.703" data-end="1168.37">Maybe you're going to search some things</span> <span data-start="1168.37" data-end="1170.95">against a performance budget.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1170.95" data-end="1175.68">You can then update GitHub and then post the data to a server.</span> <span data-start="1175.68" data-end="1179.062">So Lighthouse CI server stands on its own</span> <span data-start="1179.062" data-end="1180.77">and has a nice front end that we're going</span> <span data-start="1180.77" data-end="1183.79">to take a closer look at now.</span> <span data-start="1183.79" data-end="1188.808">So the setup is basically like, if this is your travis.yml,</span> <span data-start="1188.808" data-end="1190.1">then you're building your site.</span> <span data-start="1190.1" data-end="1191.35">You're running your own tests.</span> <span data-start="1191.35" data-end="1194.27">And the last line is basically, let's run Lighthouse CI as well</span> <span data-start="1194.27" data-end="1196.97">on a couple URLs.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1196.97" data-end="1199.86">You can set it up just on your own like this.</span> <span data-start="1199.86" data-end="1203.63">There's also an option of using a new GitHub</span> <span data-start="1203.63" data-end="1205.19">action, a Lighthouse CI action.</span> <span data-start="1205.19" data-end="1207.89">We've been working on this with our friends at Treo.</span> <span data-start="1207.89" data-end="1212.06">And it kind of batches it up and runs it inside of GitHub's CI</span> <span data-start="1212.06" data-end="1213.545">machines as well.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1213.545" data-end="1216.17"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: And so you're able to see your entire project</span> <span data-start="1216.17" data-end="1218.42">overview, how your branches have performed</span> <span data-start="1218.42" data-end="1219.815">over time against master.</span> <span data-start="1219.815" data-end="1221.69">And the trends for your Lighthouse categories</span> <span data-start="1221.69" data-end="1223.82">are all there and visible to the entire team.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1226.163" data-end="1227.58"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: And so the integration</span> <span data-start="1227.58" data-end="1229.12">with GitHub, you'll see on a pull request,</span> <span data-start="1229.12" data-end="1230.828">is in the little commit statuses pointing</span> <span data-start="1230.828" data-end="1233.96">to every URL that's tested and what the results are.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1233.96" data-end="1235.71"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: And thank goodness, gone</span> <span data-start="1235.71" data-end="1237.96">are the days where you're having to toggle and compare</span> <span data-start="1237.96" data-end="1239.76">between two Lighthouse reports side by side</span> <span data-start="1239.76" data-end="1241.59">trying to find the differences.</span> <span data-start="1241.59" data-end="1243.605">And you're actually able to see the diff view.</span> <span data-start="1243.605" data-end="1245.73">Now you can see the changes between the two reports</span> <span data-start="1245.73" data-end="1246.96">in a single view.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1246.96" data-end="1249.18">Now not only are the differences in the performance</span> <span data-start="1249.18" data-end="1252.025">metrics visible, but also — </span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1252.025" data-end="1254.4"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: Yeah, so actually, this right here, this diff</span> <span data-start="1254.4" data-end="1257.76">is the diff of the page, the article page that I measured</span> <span data-start="1257.76" data-end="1259.2">that was very slow before.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1259.2" data-end="1261.327">Has the YouTube embed.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1261.327" data-end="1262.41"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: Plus 20.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1262.41" data-end="1264.81"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: Yeah, that's a plus 20 performance score.</span> <span data-start="1264.81" data-end="1266.07">I felt good about that.</span> <span data-start="1266.07" data-end="1267.96">That was not so bad.</span> <span data-start="1267.96" data-end="1271.17">Yeah, so this, I will admit, it has the YouTube embed fix</span> <span data-start="1271.17" data-end="1274.26">and the image optimization, our sponsored image optimizations</span> <span data-start="1274.26" data-end="1275.1">from the keynote — </span> <span data-start="1275.1" data-end="1277.29">so both those two.</span> <span data-start="1277.29" data-end="1278.722">And so that's good.</span> <span data-start="1278.722" data-end="1279.93">So performance score went up.</span> <span data-start="1279.93" data-end="1281.07">We can see what happened.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1281.07" data-end="1284.042">All of our metrics dropped, which is great.</span> <span data-start="1284.042" data-end="1286.5">We can scroll down, see the summary of everything else that</span> <span data-start="1286.5" data-end="1286.85">changed.</span> <span data-start="1286.85" data-end="1289.41">So if anything stayed the same between master and this pull</span> <span data-start="1289.41" data-end="1291.33">request, it's just not shown.</span> <span data-start="1291.33" data-end="1293.063">It's only presented with what's useful.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1293.063" data-end="1294.48">And what's nice here is, also, you</span> <span data-start="1294.48" data-end="1295.99">can just click in on a few of these.</span> <span data-start="1295.99" data-end="1298.71">So for instance, total number of requests and bytes</span> <span data-start="1298.71" data-end="1300.75">for everything —  well, we see that, images,</span> <span data-start="1300.75" data-end="1304.59">we have 1.6 megs less images on the page — </span> <span data-start="1304.59" data-end="1305.35">fine.</span> <span data-start="1305.35" data-end="1306.98">I think that's fine.</span> <span data-start="1306.98" data-end="1308.91">Main thread work —  our script execution,</span> <span data-start="1308.91" data-end="1312.09">we're doing, what, 2 seconds less, a second and a half</span> <span data-start="1312.09" data-end="1314.79">less of work on the main thread.</span> <span data-start="1314.79" data-end="1317.19">And also third-party, you can see the YouTube line</span> <span data-start="1317.19" data-end="1321.1">where we drop 600k of YouTube's bytes from the page.</span> <span data-start="1321.1" data-end="1322.76">So in general, feel good about that.</span> <span data-start="1322.76" data-end="1323.76">I'm all right with that.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1323.76" data-end="1326.26"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: Yeah, that feels like a win.</span> <span data-start="1326.26" data-end="1328.36">So how excited is the team, actually, about this?</span> </p>
