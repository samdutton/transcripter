<p><span data-start="45.92" data-end="48.692">Because although you may have heard these all the time,</span> <span data-start="48.692" data-end="50.15">there are some subtle distinctions,</span> <span data-start="50.15" data-end="52.17">and they kind of get lost.</span> <span data-start="52.17" data-end="54.33">Now, Chrome, I would hope everyone knows,</span> <span data-start="54.33" data-end="56.24">is Google's browser.</span> <span data-start="56.24" data-end="59.18">This wraps in a bunch of Google services and user experience</span> <span data-start="59.18" data-end="60.17">features.</span> <span data-start="60.17" data-end="62.72">But Chrome is built on top of Chromium, which</span> <span data-start="62.72" data-end="64.86">is an open source project.</span> <span data-start="64.86" data-end="67.34">And that core open source project</span> <span data-start="67.34" data-end="69.86">also gets used by a number of other browsers — </span> <span data-start="69.86" data-end="73.58">Edge, Samsung, Internet Browser, many others.</span> <span data-start="73.58" data-end="76.73">Blink is the web platform engine inside that.</span> <span data-start="76.73" data-end="78.86">Sometimes we'll say Blink when really we</span> <span data-start="78.86" data-end="80.84">mean Chromium, and vice versa.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="80.84" data-end="81.41">Sorry.</span> <span data-start="81.41" data-end="83.07">We've tried to script this really well,</span> <span data-start="83.07" data-end="85.91">but I'm not positive we'll do it right.</span> <span data-start="85.91" data-end="88.61">And Blink is built around the implementation</span> <span data-start="88.61" data-end="90.56">of a number of features — </span> <span data-start="90.56" data-end="93.05">open standards based web platform core</span> <span data-start="93.05" data-end="95.75">features that we've all known to come and love</span> <span data-start="95.75" data-end="99.92">and HTML, CSS, JavaScript, a bunch of other APIs.</span> <span data-start="99.92" data-end="102.62">Most of those are defined in open collaborative forums</span> <span data-start="102.62" data-end="107.18">like the W3C, the IETF, the WHATWG.</span> <span data-start="107.18" data-end="110.31">The last bit is one that Yoav and I already mentioned,</span> <span data-start="110.31" data-end="113.36">which is the Web Platform Incubation Community Group.</span> <span data-start="113.36" data-end="116.27">We usually call this the WICG.</span> <span data-start="116.27" data-end="119.87">We co-chair this, along with Marcos Caceres from Mozilla</span> <span data-start="119.87" data-end="122.09">and Travis Leithead from Microsoft.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="122.09" data-end="124.19">And this is the place where we start</span> <span data-start="124.19" data-end="127.01">the journey of a lot of these collaborative efforts.</span> <span data-start="127.01" data-end="129.53">Now, we should be clear that open source is not</span> <span data-start="129.53" data-end="131.81">the same as open standards.</span> <span data-start="131.81" data-end="134.42">That's the core of what we want to discuss today, really —  how</span> <span data-start="134.42" data-end="136.76">these processes of managing an open source</span> <span data-start="136.76" data-end="139.49">project like Chromium interacts together</span> <span data-start="139.49" data-end="141.83">with the processes of managing an open standards</span> <span data-start="141.83" data-end="143.72">platform like the web.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="146.82" data-end="149.7"><span class="speaker">Yoav Weiss</span>: So, yeah, we're here at 10:00 AM</span> <span data-start="149.7" data-end="152.31">to talk about processes, and I want</span> <span data-start="152.31" data-end="155.28">to apologize about that, because no one really</span> <span data-start="155.28" data-end="157.44">likes bureaucracy.</span> <span data-start="157.44" data-end="159.84">Everyone have horror stories of processes</span> <span data-start="159.84" data-end="162.75">that went horribly wrong or make no sense.</span> <span data-start="162.75" data-end="167.79">And bureaucrat is rarely a compliment.</span> <span data-start="167.79" data-end="170.61">But at the same time, bureaucracy can be important.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="170.61" data-end="173.13">Coordinating humans is hard.</span> <span data-start="173.13" data-end="177">Chromium is a huge open source project that's seeing 90,000</span> <span data-start="177" data-end="181.95">commits a year from over 2,000 different contributors working</span> <span data-start="181.95" data-end="185.01">for 55 different companies, potentially</span> <span data-start="185.01" data-end="188.87">with multiple organizations inside of each company.</span> <span data-start="188.87" data-end="191.61">And each one of those parties have slightly different</span> <span data-start="191.61" data-end="193.8">interests.</span> <span data-start="193.8" data-end="196.17">It's also important to recognize that a lot</span> <span data-start="196.17" data-end="199.96">of those contributions are coming from Google employees,</span> <span data-start="199.96" data-end="205.75">but non-Google contributors are almost 20% of that pie chart.</span> <span data-start="205.75" data-end="209.91">And as someone who was a Chromium contributor many years</span> <span data-start="209.91" data-end="212.73">before becoming a Google employee,</span> <span data-start="212.73" data-end="215.86">that's something that's near and dear to my heart.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="215.86" data-end="220.44">So in order to make sure that all those contributions</span> <span data-start="220.44" data-end="225.09">from different parties all make sense, we need an open process.</span> <span data-start="225.09" data-end="227.1">We needed to make sure that the project is</span> <span data-start="227.1" data-end="228.99">making progress towards its goals</span> <span data-start="228.99" data-end="232.623">and remains true to its mission.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="232.623" data-end="234.29"><span class="speaker">Chris Wilson</span>: And it's important to note</span> <span data-start="234.29" data-end="236.57">that open standards organizations also</span> <span data-start="236.57" data-end="238.2">have their own processes.</span> <span data-start="238.2" data-end="240.65">Now, I'm going to focus mostly on the W3C</span> <span data-start="240.65" data-end="242.66">during the course of this talk.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="242.66" data-end="245.57">I'm on their advisory board, so I have the most insight there.</span> <span data-start="245.57" data-end="248.9">But the diversity across other open standards organizations</span> <span data-start="248.9" data-end="251.13">is actually fairly similar.</span> <span data-start="251.13" data-end="254.39">The W3C has over 400 different member companies,</span> <span data-start="254.39" data-end="257.06">participating in more than 40 active working groups</span> <span data-start="257.06" data-end="259.64">and interest groups, and 300 community</span> <span data-start="259.64" data-end="263.54">groups that kind of explore different topics in a less</span> <span data-start="263.54" data-end="265.16">organized way.</span> <span data-start="265.16" data-end="269.12">The main document that governs the W3C's process</span> <span data-start="269.12" data-end="271.85">is more than 50 pages long.</span> <span data-start="271.85" data-end="273.95">So there are lots of different people, lots</span> <span data-start="273.95" data-end="275.45">of different needs involved.</span> <span data-start="275.45" data-end="277.49">And in this context, Chromium's engagement</span> <span data-start="277.49" data-end="279.92">is really just one piece that needs to fit</span> <span data-start="279.92" data-end="282.48">into that standards process.</span> <span data-start="282.48" data-end="284.27">In fact, although Google may dominate</span> <span data-start="284.27" data-end="286.82">the participation in Chromium, we're not at all</span> <span data-start="286.82" data-end="288.5">the majority in standards.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="288.5" data-end="290.81">Yoav just showed you this pie chart of participants</span> <span data-start="290.81" data-end="292.34">in Chromium on the left.</span> <span data-start="292.34" data-end="293.84">The graph on the right is the number</span> <span data-start="293.84" data-end="298.03">of individual participants in the W3C by company.</span> <span data-start="298.03" data-end="301.4">Now, although Google is still that largest slice</span> <span data-start="301.4" data-end="302.6">single company — </span> <span data-start="302.6" data-end="305.15">we do believe in and we participate really heavily</span> <span data-start="305.15" data-end="307.7">in open standards efforts — </span> <span data-start="307.7" data-end="311.09">we're only about an eighth of the overall participation.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="311.09" data-end="315.44">In fact, if you add up all of the Chromium browsers together,</span> <span data-start="315.44" data-end="319.07">like Microsoft's participation and Samsung's participation</span> <span data-start="319.07" data-end="322.49">and Chrome, you'll find this is still less than a quarter</span> <span data-start="322.49" data-end="325.28">of the whole participation at the W3C.</span> <span data-start="325.28" data-end="327.35">The web is much broader than just Chromium.</span> <span data-start="329.98" data-end="333.59">Now, Chrome is, however, fully committed to the broader web.</span> <span data-start="333.59" data-end="335.56">In fact, the first half of our mission</span> <span data-start="335.56" data-end="338.68">is explicitly to make the web the premier platform</span> <span data-start="338.68" data-end="341.415">for its experiencing the world's information.</span> <span data-start="341.415" data-end="342.79">The second half of our mission is</span> <span data-start="342.79" data-end="344.32">to deliver the best implementation</span> <span data-start="344.32" data-end="346">of that platform.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="346" data-end="348.58">Now, it's natural to ask, why do we really</span> <span data-start="348.58" data-end="350.41">care so much about the web?</span> <span data-start="350.41" data-end="352.99">We do work on at least one other premier native platform.</span> <span data-start="352.99" data-end="355.03">And of course, our revenue doesn't come</span> <span data-start="355.03" data-end="356.92">directly from the web itself.</span> <span data-start="356.92" data-end="359.08">We don't sell Chrome.</span> <span data-start="359.08" data-end="362.59">But the answer is one we've talked about many, many times,</span> <span data-start="362.59" data-end="365.41">starting with the very first Chrome Dev Summit.</span> <span data-start="365.41" data-end="367.18">Those of you who participated in that</span> <span data-start="367.18" data-end="371.17">might recognize this slide and the SLICE acronym.</span> <span data-start="371.17" data-end="374.95">We believe a Secure, Linkable, Indexable, Composable,</span> <span data-start="374.95" data-end="377.89">Ephemeral platform is critical.</span> <span data-start="377.89" data-end="380.8">Above all, the fact that this platform is open</span> <span data-start="380.8" data-end="384.55">makes it more powerful than any single vendor.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="384.55" data-end="386.14">Yes, even Google.</span> <span data-start="386.14" data-end="387.94">So these attributes make a shared openly</span> <span data-start="387.94" data-end="391.847">defined platform, this critical value for users and developers.</span> <span data-start="391.847" data-end="394.18">And although these core critical attributes don't really</span> <span data-start="394.18" data-end="396.07">change over time, like we're pretty much</span> <span data-start="396.07" data-end="399.77">using the same slide from seven years ago — </span> <span data-start="399.77" data-end="401.83">well, six years ago — </span> <span data-start="401.83" data-end="405.16">we want the web to always be open, secure, and ephemeral.</span> <span data-start="405.16" data-end="407.17">It's important to recognize that the web needs</span> <span data-start="407.17" data-end="410.26">to evolve as computing evolves.</span> <span data-start="410.26" data-end="413.83">A viable platform cannot afford to stand still.</span> <span data-start="413.83" data-end="416.71">Computing and how we users experience</span> <span data-start="416.71" data-end="419.41">it continues to march forward, and so does</span> <span data-start="419.41" data-end="421.75">our expectations of computing.</span> <span data-start="421.75" data-end="425.23">When I first started working on the web platform 26 years ago,</span> <span data-start="425.23" data-end="427.3">it was a radically different world,</span> <span data-start="427.3" data-end="431.033">when graphical UIs were still a relatively new concept.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="431.033" data-end="432.7">The smartphone that's in my pocket right</span> <span data-start="432.7" data-end="436.24">now, the platform for most of my web consumption,</span> <span data-start="436.24" data-end="439.03">that's more powerful than the Cray supercomputers</span> <span data-start="439.03" data-end="442.15">that I worked with at that time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="442.15" data-end="444.91">Now, even in more recent times, it took years for the web</span> <span data-start="444.91" data-end="447.91">to pivot, even as a content platform,</span> <span data-start="447.91" data-end="450.16">from desktop to mobile.</span> <span data-start="450.16" data-end="451.93">The web was slow to move from this kind</span> <span data-start="451.93" data-end="455.29">of hard-coded, pixel-perfect desktop experience</span> <span data-start="455.29" data-end="459.45">to a mobile first development model.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="459.45" data-end="461.57"><span class="speaker">Yoav Weiss</span>: And if we want the web to remain</span> <span data-start="461.57" data-end="464.21">relevant for years to come, there's</span> <span data-start="464.21" data-end="467.67">a lot of work to be done.</span> <span data-start="467.67" data-end="468.17">so?</span> <span data-start="468.17" data-end="471.41">We need the platform to evolve, but what's the rush?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="471.41" data-end="475.25">Admittedly, we are shipping a lot of new features.</span> <span data-start="475.25" data-end="477.11">Can we just slow down?</span> <span data-start="477.11" data-end="479.21">Well, there are multiple areas where</span> <span data-start="479.21" data-end="484.15">we think the web needs to urgently improve.</span> <span data-start="484.15" data-end="487.76">Developer experience is one, because we see developers</span> <span data-start="487.76" data-end="491.39">working around the web platform's basic model of page</span> <span data-start="491.39" data-end="494.63">navigations to create different models that fit them</span> <span data-start="494.63" data-end="496.25">and their users better.</span> <span data-start="496.25" data-end="498.53">We see them —  well, you — </span> <span data-start="498.53" data-end="502.73">using complex tools in order to solve common problems.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="502.73" data-end="504.6">And we feel like we need to do better.</span> <span data-start="504.6" data-end="506.6">We need to provide better building blocks that</span> <span data-start="506.6" data-end="509.33">will enable developers to easily create</span> <span data-start="509.33" data-end="512.63">the experiences they need.</span> <span data-start="512.63" data-end="515.12">And the three talks coming right after this one</span> <span data-start="515.12" data-end="519.44">will outline exactly what we're doing on that front.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="519.44" data-end="522.62">We also see users spending more and more</span> <span data-start="522.62" data-end="526.01">of their time in native apps and less of their time on the web.</span> <span data-start="526.01" data-end="529.28">We need the web to match those users' expectations</span> <span data-start="529.28" data-end="533.39">of mobile experiences.</span> <span data-start="533.39" data-end="536.03">Highly related to that, there's the performance front,</span> <span data-start="536.03" data-end="540.2">where we have data that shows that most users still</span> <span data-start="540.2" data-end="545.3">have subpar experiences on the web, which we know is causing</span> <span data-start="545.3" data-end="547.07">them frustration, at best.</span> <span data-start="547.07" data-end="552.67">And we need a faster web if we want our users to stick around.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="552.67" data-end="555.25">There are also new user interaction models</span> <span data-start="555.25" data-end="556.63">that are arriving — </span> <span data-start="556.63" data-end="561.04">most notably, VR and AR —  that the web needs to be ready for.</span> <span data-start="561.04" data-end="564.76">And finally, computing has moved to mobile.</span> <span data-start="564.76" data-end="566.59">The web needs to be as present there</span> <span data-start="566.59" data-end="572.26">as it is on desktop, because this is where the users are.</span> <span data-start="572.26" data-end="576.16">So as the project is focused on improving the web platform,</span> <span data-start="576.16" data-end="580.48">we have two major ways, two major tools, to do that — </span> <span data-start="580.48" data-end="584.59">adding new features that will help developers and users</span> <span data-start="584.59" data-end="589.61">and removing user-hostile features from the platform.</span> <span data-start="589.61" data-end="593.08">Both of these have obvious benefits, but also slightly</span> <span data-start="593.08" data-end="596.35">less obvious risks.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="769.79" data-end="772.4">That Blink process is not a replacement for the standards</span> <span data-start="772.4" data-end="774.72">process, but a separate one.</span> <span data-start="774.72" data-end="777.26">And it's not determining what gets standardized,</span> <span data-start="777.26" data-end="782.71">but what code can land in Chromium turned on by default.</span> <span data-start="782.71" data-end="786.26">Now, those standards processes, on the other hand,</span> <span data-start="786.26" data-end="789.06">are a lot broader, and they can be a lot slower, too.</span> <span data-start="789.06" data-end="790.56">As I pointed out before, Chromium</span> <span data-start="790.56" data-end="793.86">is just one engine and one slice of the participation driving</span> <span data-start="793.86" data-end="795.04">standards.</span> <span data-start="795.04" data-end="797.37">Now, we do try very hard to build</span> <span data-start="797.37" data-end="799.17">that collaboration between different teams</span> <span data-start="799.17" data-end="802.35">from different organizations and across the wider web standards</span> <span data-start="802.35" data-end="805.08">community by consistently participating</span> <span data-start="805.08" data-end="806.7">in those open forums — </span> <span data-start="806.7" data-end="811.81">the W3C, the WHATWG, the IETF, TC39, and ECMA, and the like — </span> <span data-start="811.81" data-end="813.78">and bringing our needs to those groups</span> <span data-start="813.78" data-end="816.62">to incubate them in public.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="816.62" data-end="818.67">And this process of incubation first</span> <span data-start="818.67" data-end="821.49">is one that we actually started championing in Chromium</span> <span data-start="821.49" data-end="824.55">a few years ago as a way to explore new additions</span> <span data-start="824.55" data-end="827.4">to the web platform with low overhead,</span> <span data-start="827.4" data-end="830.825">without committing first, without saying,</span> <span data-start="830.825" data-end="832.95">hey, we're going to ship this feature at some point</span> <span data-start="832.95" data-end="834.3">in the very near future.</span> <span data-start="834.3" data-end="836.11">Because some ideas fail.</span> <span data-start="836.11" data-end="838.08">In fact, some ideas should fail.</span> <span data-start="838.08" data-end="839.73">But you don't really know that upfront.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="839.73" data-end="842.91">We didn't want to get those ideas baked into a standard</span> <span data-start="842.91" data-end="846.78">before we realized, hey, maybe this wasn't such a great idea.</span> <span data-start="846.78" data-end="848.8">Incubation in the WICG, for example,</span> <span data-start="848.8" data-end="851.31">is a great way to work together in public</span> <span data-start="851.31" data-end="853.92">and collect intellectual property commitments</span> <span data-start="853.92" data-end="856.68">so eventual standards will be free to implement,</span> <span data-start="856.68" data-end="858.42">but with low overhead.</span> <span data-start="858.42" data-end="860.61">In short, the idea was to get to 80%</span> <span data-start="860.61" data-end="864.15">of the exploration with a much lower overhead,</span> <span data-start="864.15" data-end="867.4">but responsibly, as well.</span> <span data-start="867.4" data-end="869.92">Now, this leads to a couple of key points.</span> <span data-start="869.92" data-end="872.61">First, incubations can actively fail.</span> <span data-start="872.61" data-end="874.11">They can go into a deep freeze.</span> <span data-start="874.11" data-end="877.11">They can wait for more data, some other change.</span> <span data-start="877.11" data-end="881.04">Or in some cases, they may ship in one browser or another prior</span> <span data-start="881.04" data-end="884.34">to transitioning to an official recognized standard.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="884.34" data-end="888.58">Now, in that latter case, this is not the end of the story.</span> <span data-start="888.58" data-end="890.37">This isn't the endpoint.</span> <span data-start="890.37" data-end="893.37">Not everyone agrees on which incubations are ready to ship.</span> <span data-start="893.37" data-end="895.65">Everybody has different priorities.</span> <span data-start="895.65" data-end="898.65">But when Chromium ships incubation</span> <span data-start="898.65" data-end="902.47">status specifications because we believe they're needed,</span> <span data-start="902.47" data-end="905.22">but we don't have agreement from other vendors or developers</span> <span data-start="905.22" data-end="907.23">to turn them into standards yet, we're</span> <span data-start="907.23" data-end="909.48">taking on a deeper responsibility.</span> <span data-start="909.48" data-end="911.82">We have to continue to maintain that feature.</span> <span data-start="911.82" data-end="914.79">We have to continue to push for cross-vendor collaboration</span> <span data-start="914.79" data-end="916.22">and standardization.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="916.22" data-end="919.08">And if those features do get picked up by others later,</span> <span data-start="919.08" data-end="921.45">we need to work together to possibly change</span> <span data-start="921.45" data-end="923.31">what we already shipped to make them</span> <span data-start="923.31" data-end="926.16">truly cross-industry standards.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="926.16" data-end="929.82">Incubations are not standards — </span> <span data-start="929.82" data-end="930.93">yet, at least.</span> <span data-start="930.93" data-end="933.24">Incubations only turn into standards</span> <span data-start="933.24" data-end="935.73">when a sufficiently cross-industry set</span> <span data-start="935.73" data-end="937.5">of participants in open standards</span> <span data-start="937.5" data-end="940.44">agree that they should become interoperable.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="940.44" data-end="944.2">Until multiple vendors want to ship those implementations,</span> <span data-start="944.2" data-end="946.8">there's only so much one vendor can really do.</span> <span data-start="946.8" data-end="948.75">Now, we do control our ship cycles.</span> <span data-start="948.75" data-end="951.42">We choose what features Chromium is going to ship</span> <span data-start="951.42" data-end="953.22">and what features Chromium believes</span> <span data-start="953.22" data-end="955.74">are critical to provide to developers.</span> <span data-start="955.74" data-end="959.1">But what becomes a standard is an open community decision.</span> <span data-start="959.1" data-end="961.17">The broader community of developers and vendors</span> <span data-start="961.17" data-end="964.8">need to want this feature to happen.</span> <span data-start="964.8" data-end="967.94">So as incubations mature and there's open agreement</span> <span data-start="967.94" data-end="970.25">that there should be an interoperable standard,</span> <span data-start="970.25" data-end="972.29">it's time to create a working group</span> <span data-start="972.29" data-end="974.45">with multiple cross-industry stakeholders,</span> <span data-start="974.45" data-end="976.52">or be adopted by a working group,</span> <span data-start="976.52" data-end="978.97">and set timelines for deliverables.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1008.41" data-end="1011.51">Also, this can be different across different organizations,</span> <span data-start="1011.51" data-end="1014.17">like the W3C versus the WHATWG, and I</span> <span data-start="1014.17" data-end="1017.02">don't want to spend all our time in that detail.</span> <span data-start="1017.02" data-end="1019.683">But with this in mind as the end goal,</span> <span data-start="1019.683" data-end="1021.1">we wanted to dive into the journey</span> <span data-start="1021.1" data-end="1025.152">of a feature in Chromium from idea to shipping.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1484.428" data-end="1485.97">This is where we're asking developers</span> <span data-start="1485.97" data-end="1488.82">to try out the designs, to check out a feature,</span> <span data-start="1488.82" data-end="1491.01">switching on flags and testing them out</span> <span data-start="1491.01" data-end="1493.74">with the understanding, of course, that they may not ship.</span> <span data-start="1493.74" data-end="1498.353">They certainly may not ship in that particular form at all.</span> <span data-start="1498.353" data-end="1499.77">But we also have another tool that</span> <span data-start="1499.77" data-end="1503.2">comes into play at this point that we wanted to mention.</span> <span data-start="1503.2" data-end="1506.76">And in Chrome, we have this tool called Origin Trials.</span> <span data-start="1506.76" data-end="1510">Now, this is not a mandatory step for feature development.</span> <span data-start="1510" data-end="1512.53">It's a useful one, a lot of time,</span> <span data-start="1512.53" data-end="1515.19">because it's a way to get even broader developer testing</span> <span data-start="1515.19" data-end="1516.3">on a particular feature.</span> <span data-start="1516.3" data-end="1520.35">A Chromium engineer communicates this intent to experiment,</span> <span data-start="1520.35" data-end="1523.29">and then any developer out there can register</span> <span data-start="1523.29" data-end="1525.21">for a key for their domain.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1740.65" data-end="1743.4">There are cases where after we shipped,</span> <span data-start="1743.4" data-end="1746.76">substantial feedback from other vendors and developers</span> <span data-start="1746.76" data-end="1749.76">convinced us that we need to change the API shape.</span> <span data-start="1749.76" data-end="1752.7">And our willingness to make those breaking changes</span> <span data-start="1752.7" data-end="1756.99">enables us to listen and act on that feedback.</span> <span data-start="1756.99" data-end="1761.25">Prominent examples include the web components V0,</span> <span data-start="1761.25" data-end="1765.06">which shipped and is now in the process of being</span> <span data-start="1765.06" data-end="1770.71">removed in favor of web components V1 as well as video.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1782.148" data-end="1784.14"><span class="speaker">Yoav Weiss</span>: Yup.</span> <span data-start="1784.14" data-end="1787.66">And so even when an API is about to ship,</span> <span data-start="1787.66" data-end="1790.4">there's still a lot of room for developer involvement</span> <span data-start="1790.4" data-end="1791.6">and feedback.</span> <span data-start="1791.6" data-end="1795.05">Feedback on the intent thread can provide a lot of insights</span> <span data-start="1795.05" data-end="1799.11">and can influence the API owner's decision.</span> <span data-start="1799.11" data-end="1802.04">Similarly to the previous step, playing around</span> <span data-start="1802.04" data-end="1805.79">with the implemented API by turning on flags</span> <span data-start="1805.79" data-end="1808.06">before it's shipped and reporting issue,</span> <span data-start="1808.06" data-end="1810.35">or even after it's shipped, can be extremely</span> <span data-start="1810.35" data-end="1812.94">helpful for newly shipped APIs.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1812.94" data-end="1816.53">And finally, actually using the APIs you find useful</span> <span data-start="1816.53" data-end="1818.54">is an extremely strong signal for us</span> <span data-start="1818.54" data-end="1822.85">to ensure us that we made the right decision.</span> <span data-start="1822.85" data-end="1828.43">And at this point, the feature is fully mature, on its own,</span> <span data-start="1828.43" data-end="1829.85">theoretically in the wild.</span> <span data-start="1829.85" data-end="1833.65">But in practice, just sits on the couch all day.</span> <span data-start="1833.65" data-end="1835.81">This is where the metaphor kind of breaks down.</span> <span data-start="1838.6" data-end="1842.29">So, to recap, the typical journey of an API</span> <span data-start="1842.29" data-end="1845.32">goes from researching the problem space,</span> <span data-start="1845.32" data-end="1848.02">publishing an explainer with use cases,</span> <span data-start="1848.02" data-end="1852.46">designing a solution in the open with interested parties,</span> <span data-start="1852.46" data-end="1854.63">experimenting with that solution,</span> <span data-start="1854.63" data-end="1858.37">and eventually shipping it or not.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1858.37" data-end="1861.22">And note that at any stage, we can</span> <span data-start="1861.22" data-end="1864.41">decide that we need to go back and address some issues.</span> <span data-start="1864.41" data-end="1866.32">For example, an origin trial can reveal</span> <span data-start="1866.32" data-end="1868.93">that there are some problems in the design</span> <span data-start="1868.93" data-end="1870.79">or the understanding of the problem space</span> <span data-start="1870.79" data-end="1876.02">and cause us to go back to one or two steps before that.</span> <span data-start="1876.02" data-end="1880.84">And on top of that, there are also always exceptions</span> <span data-start="1880.84" data-end="1882.5">to that general flow.</span> <span data-start="1882.5" data-end="1885.13">So just last week, we had an intent to experiment</span> <span data-start="1885.13" data-end="1888.22">for an origin trial that was required in order to gather</span> <span data-start="1888.22" data-end="1891.37">data to understand a certain use case</span> <span data-start="1891.37" data-end="1893.26">and know whether it will or will not</span> <span data-start="1893.26" data-end="1894.85">provide performance benefits.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1894.85" data-end="1900.423">So an origin trial is part of step zero, if you will.</span> </p>
