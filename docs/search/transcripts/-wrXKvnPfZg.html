<p><span data-start="9.21" data-end="12.24">This video talks about WebP, how it's being used today,</span> <span data-start="12.24" data-end="14.77">and what we're developing next for the web.</span> <span data-start="14.77" data-end="17.04">Some of you may be familiar with our previous videos</span> <span data-start="17.04" data-end="20.46">on image compression, which you can find on the links below.</span> <span data-start="20.46" data-end="22.74">WebP is an image format designed to save bytes</span> <span data-start="22.74" data-end="24.12">on the wire for the web.</span> <span data-start="24.12" data-end="26.61">Getting better visual quality in fewer bytes</span> <span data-start="26.61" data-end="30.21">means faster load times, reduced data usage, and increased user</span> <span data-start="30.21" data-end="31.56">engagement.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="31.56" data-end="33.48">Compared to the best shaping encoders,</span> <span data-start="33.48" data-end="36.3">WebP can reduce file sizes by 20% to 30%</span> <span data-start="36.3" data-end="38.34">at the same visual quality.</span> <span data-start="38.34" data-end="40.8">The lossless WebP mode sees similar savings</span> <span data-start="40.8" data-end="42.78">over [? PNG ?] codes.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="42.78" data-end="45.96">On the animation side, WebP can produce even greater savings</span> <span data-start="45.96" data-end="47.01">over GIFs.</span> <span data-start="47.01" data-end="48.99">The format is open-source and free,</span> <span data-start="48.99" data-end="53.128">so you can try out WebP today by checking our developer site.</span> <span data-start="53.128" data-end="55.17">So what has changed for WebP since the format was</span> <span data-start="55.17" data-end="56.5">first released?</span> <span data-start="56.5" data-end="59.31">Well, all along, the encode and decode libraries</span> <span data-start="59.31" data-end="61.44">have continued to improve not only in compression</span> <span data-start="61.44" data-end="65.28">performance, but also in CPU and run efficiency.</span> <span data-start="65.28" data-end="68.04">Last year, we released a 1.0 version of libwebp,</span> <span data-start="68.04" data-end="69.6">with future updates focusing only</span> <span data-start="69.6" data-end="71.82">on maintenance and bug fixes.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="71.82" data-end="73.89">Huge thanks to all the open-source contributors,</span> <span data-start="73.89" data-end="75.81">bug filers, and testers who helped</span> <span data-start="75.81" data-end="78.57">make libwebp the code base it is today.</span> <span data-start="78.57" data-end="81.45">Another recent change is native browser support.</span> <span data-start="81.45" data-end="83.16">In the last year Firefox and Edge</span> <span data-start="83.16" data-end="85.44">started shipping with WebP decoders,</span> <span data-start="85.44" data-end="88.62">adding to longstanding support in Chromium-based browsers</span> <span data-start="88.62" data-end="90.27">and Android.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="90.27" data-end="92.79">WebP has never been available in more places, reaching</span> <span data-start="92.79" data-end="96.03">80% of web users, according to caniuse.com.</span> <span data-start="96.03" data-end="98.85">For browsers without support, like Safari or Internet</span> <span data-start="98.85" data-end="101.7">Explorer, check out a prior video on the picture element</span> <span data-start="101.7" data-end="103.74">for a JPEG fallback.</span> <span data-start="103.74" data-end="105.48">You can also use WebAssembly to add</span> <span data-start="105.48" data-end="109.08">a decoder to browsers, only when WebP content is being served.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="109.08" data-end="110.88">For more information, check out this video</span> <span data-start="110.88" data-end="114.51">from Google Developer Expert Kenneth Christiansen.</span> <span data-start="114.51" data-end="117.03">The web ecosystem has also expanded for WebP,</span> <span data-start="117.03" data-end="120.36">with new options for essential image tool chains.</span> <span data-start="120.36" data-end="123.81">Most recently, our team launched WebPShop, and open-source</span> <span data-start="123.81" data-end="127.08">Photoshop plug-in for importing and exporting WebP images</span> <span data-start="127.08" data-end="129.12">in Adobe's Creative Suite.</span> <span data-start="129.12" data-end="130.8">This is on top of existing support</span> <span data-start="130.8" data-end="134.25">in Google properties like Android Studio and Squoosh,</span> <span data-start="134.25" data-end="137.13">as well as open-source tools like Gimp and ImageMagick.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="137.13" data-end="140.535">WebP has never been easier to use on your site.</span> <span data-start="140.535" data-end="142.41">You won't be alone, since more developers are</span> <span data-start="142.41" data-end="144.65">using WebP than ever before.</span> <span data-start="144.65" data-end="146.97">Beyond success stories at Google brands like Shopping</span> <span data-start="146.97" data-end="150.45">or YouTube, companies like Shopify, Vox, and Pinterest</span> <span data-start="150.45" data-end="153.57">have detailed how WebP improved their sites' quality.</span> <span data-start="153.57" data-end="156.3">Now that we've accomplished so much with WebP, what's next?</span> <span data-start="156.3" data-end="158.97">Well, as future work, we're exploring new algorithms</span> <span data-start="158.97" data-end="162.24">that can bring an extra 25% size reduction as well</span> <span data-start="162.24" data-end="166.39">as a wider color space, hence enabling HDR display.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="166.39" data-end="168.24">Of course, we're keeping the features that</span> <span data-start="168.24" data-end="171.39">make WebP a great compression format for the web, animation</span> <span data-start="171.39" data-end="173.58">and lossless, interruptibility —  meaning</span> <span data-start="173.58" data-end="176.04">you can display something, even if your image is not fully</span> <span data-start="176.04" data-end="178.8">downloaded —  no need for dedicated hardware,</span> <span data-start="178.8" data-end="182.86">and, of course, low CPU and memory footprint.</span> <span data-start="182.86" data-end="185.74">Thanks for watching, and stay tuned for updates.</span> <span data-start="185.74" data-end="189.09">[MUSIC PLAYING]</span> </p>
