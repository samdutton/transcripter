<p><span data-start="42.21" data-end="45.78">Specifically, users love presentations</span> <span data-start="45.78" data-end="47.88">that work, number one.</span> <span data-start="47.88" data-end="51.33">They love sites that load fast consistently</span> <span data-start="51.33" data-end="54.09">and offer good runtime performance.</span> <span data-start="54.09" data-end="58.89">They love sites where they feel safe when they trust their data</span> <span data-start="58.89" data-end="61.95">or they do transactions when they decide to do so.</span> <span data-start="61.95" data-end="64.967">They like sites that feel accessible,</span> <span data-start="64.967" data-end="67.05">and they are integrated with the full capabilities</span> <span data-start="67.05" data-end="68.16">of their devices.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="68.16" data-end="72.12">And they love sites that offer great content quality.</span> <span data-start="72.12" data-end="76.5">The good news is that we can build today experiences that</span> <span data-start="76.5" data-end="79.92">have these pillars if we take advantage of the capabilities</span> <span data-start="79.92" data-end="82.21">that the modern web has to offer.</span> <span data-start="82.21" data-end="86.52">Now, doing this is what we call progressive web development.</span> <span data-start="86.52" data-end="88.68">In essence, progressive web development</span> <span data-start="88.68" data-end="93.81">is developing user-first experiences</span> <span data-start="93.81" data-end="96.6">using modern workflows and modern web APIs,</span> <span data-start="96.6" data-end="99.42">following coding best practices and performance best practices,</span> <span data-start="99.42" data-end="102.54">and taking advantage of effective incentive mechanisms</span> <span data-start="102.54" data-end="106.32">and validation structures that are available to all, to us.</span> <span data-start="106.32" data-end="109.05">Now, we can take advantage of these principles</span> <span data-start="109.05" data-end="111.09">in different ways, depending about how</span> <span data-start="111.09" data-end="113.22">we go through the creative process,</span> <span data-start="113.22" data-end="114.78">how do we create things in the web.</span> <span data-start="114.78" data-end="117.18">In general, the things that we create in the web</span> <span data-start="117.18" data-end="118.74">follow in two categories.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="118.74" data-end="121.68">On one hand, we can build websites or web apps</span> <span data-start="121.68" data-end="123.63">from scratch, in which case we have</span> <span data-start="123.63" data-end="125.97">full control of the whole creative journey,</span> <span data-start="125.97" data-end="128.789">from the build process, to the functionality of the app,</span> <span data-start="128.789" data-end="130.41">to the look and feel.</span> <span data-start="130.41" data-end="134.61">Or we can take advantage of some kind of Content Management</span> <span data-start="134.61" data-end="139.59">System, or CMS for short, that are software platforms that</span> <span data-start="139.59" data-end="142.11">add a layer of abstraction on top of the open web</span> <span data-start="142.11" data-end="145.53">to offer capabilities to create, publish, and consume</span> <span data-start="145.53" data-end="147.54">digital content on the web.</span> <span data-start="147.54" data-end="150.78">If we follow the first route, we have full control and full</span> <span data-start="150.78" data-end="151.29">flexibility.</span> <span data-start="151.29" data-end="152.13">It's very powerful.</span> <span data-start="152.13" data-end="154.95">But also, it requires a lot of expertise and resources</span> <span data-start="154.95" data-end="155.9">to follow it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="155.9" data-end="157.56">If we follow the second route, we</span> <span data-start="157.56" data-end="159.21">can take advantage of the capabilities</span> <span data-start="159.21" data-end="160.804">that the CMS has to offer to us.</span> <span data-start="160.804" data-end="162.72">But then at the end of the day, the experience</span> <span data-start="162.72" data-end="166.18">that we can offer to our users depends on the characteristic</span> <span data-start="166.18" data-end="169.11">of the CMS that we choose.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="169.11" data-end="173.07">Now, it turns out that nowadays, the majority of content</span> <span data-start="173.07" data-end="175.74">in the web is created and consumed</span> <span data-start="175.74" data-end="177.96">via some kind of content management system.</span> <span data-start="177.96" data-end="180.87">Specifically, 54% of sites today are</span> <span data-start="180.87" data-end="183.46">built on some kind of content management system.</span> <span data-start="183.46" data-end="186.81">And we saw this year 11% year over year growth.</span> <span data-start="186.81" data-end="188.78">These are staggering statistics.</span> <span data-start="188.78" data-end="190.56">And there are other systems that do not</span> <span data-start="190.56" data-end="193.38">think of themselves as CMSes but also offer</span> <span data-start="193.38" data-end="195.75">the same capabilities that make it very easy to create</span> <span data-start="195.75" data-end="197.11">and publish content.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="197.11" data-end="201.01">So in reality, these statistics are much higher.</span> <span data-start="201.01" data-end="203.4">So this basically means that the CMS space</span> <span data-start="203.4" data-end="206.53">is very large and very complex.</span> <span data-start="206.53" data-end="208.92">CMS comes in many shape and form.</span> <span data-start="208.92" data-end="212.76">And they vary according to certain dimensions.</span> <span data-start="212.76" data-end="215.79">For example, you can have static versus dynamic, open source,</span> <span data-start="215.79" data-end="218.76">closed source, special purpose, general purpose.</span> <span data-start="218.76" data-end="221.64">But although there are differences between them,</span> <span data-start="221.64" data-end="224.13">they also share a lot of commonalities.</span> <span data-start="224.13" data-end="228.15">And specifically, many of them face common challenges</span> <span data-start="228.15" data-end="231.3">when it comes to integrating progressive web technologies</span> <span data-start="231.3" data-end="233.65">into their platforms.</span> <span data-start="233.65" data-end="236.86">So many of these systems are very large and complex.</span> <span data-start="236.86" data-end="238.84">They have many interacting components.</span> <span data-start="238.84" data-end="240.58">They have large code bases.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="240.58" data-end="244.36">They have legacy code, technical depth, and so on.</span> <span data-start="244.36" data-end="246.16">There are also, some of them have</span> <span data-start="246.16" data-end="249.16">evolved on top of initial architectural choices that</span> <span data-start="249.16" data-end="253.36">make it difficult for them to evolve and become progressive.</span> <span data-start="253.36" data-end="255.49">They also suffer from fragmentation</span> <span data-start="255.49" data-end="257.649">very often in terms of things like the quality</span> <span data-start="257.649" data-end="259.42">of the components that make them,</span> <span data-start="259.42" data-end="261.724">or the expertise of the developer community,</span> <span data-start="261.724" data-end="263.89">or the type of users that are creating and consuming</span> <span data-start="263.89" data-end="265.9">content on the platform.</span> <span data-start="265.9" data-end="267.73">And often —  and this is very important — </span> <span data-start="267.73" data-end="272.35">CMSes lack the effective incentives for developers</span> <span data-start="272.35" data-end="273.73">to do the right thing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="273.73" data-end="277.75">For example, exposing coding and performance metrics</span> <span data-start="277.75" data-end="281.35">so that users of the CMS can choose solutions</span> <span data-start="281.35" data-end="284.37">based on quality and not just on popularity.</span> <span data-start="284.37" data-end="287.43">Now, we want to tackle these challenges in the CMS space.</span> <span data-start="287.43" data-end="289.21">And in order to reason about how to do</span> <span data-start="289.21" data-end="291.07">that, it is very useful to do a [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span data-start="291.07" data-end="294.16">or thinking about these systems in terms of the components that</span> <span data-start="294.16" data-end="296.23">make them, OK?</span> <span data-start="296.23" data-end="299.59">A CMS ecosystem, one way or another,</span> <span data-start="299.59" data-end="303.76">has certain components that form a unique ecosystem for each</span> <span data-start="303.76" data-end="304.48">of them.</span> <span data-start="304.48" data-end="307.72">There is usually a core, a platform core,</span> <span data-start="307.72" data-end="310.26">that makes the functionality of the system.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="310.26" data-end="312.91">There is usually some kind of extension mechanism</span> <span data-start="312.91" data-end="315.732">that allows you to extend the core functionality.</span> <span data-start="315.732" data-end="317.19">These extensions are usually called</span> <span data-start="317.19" data-end="321.01">modules in some CMSes, plugins on another, also, themes,</span> <span data-start="321.01" data-end="323.61">if they have to do with the look and feel of the system.</span> <span data-start="323.61" data-end="325.84">There is usually a developers' community</span> <span data-start="325.84" data-end="328.66">that are in charge of evolving both the core</span> <span data-start="328.66" data-end="330.92">and the extensions of that platform.</span> <span data-start="330.92" data-end="332.86">And then there is the user base of the CMS</span> <span data-start="332.86" data-end="335.35">that are either creating content or consuming</span> <span data-start="335.35" data-end="338.45">content on the platform.</span> <span data-start="338.45" data-end="341.02">So when we talk about progressive content management</span> <span data-start="341.02" data-end="342.82">systems, we are talking about bringing</span> <span data-start="342.82" data-end="345.01">the principles of progressive web development</span> <span data-start="345.01" data-end="349.66">to the components of each of these ecosystems, OK?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="349.66" data-end="352.3">For example, how do we bring coding and performance</span> <span data-start="352.3" data-end="355.15">best practices to the developer ecosystem</span> <span data-start="355.15" data-end="357.22">so that they can do the right thing?</span> <span data-start="357.22" data-end="360.88">Can we bring tooling so that it make it easy</span> <span data-start="360.88" data-end="364.24">for them to do the right thing in the first place?</span> <span data-start="364.24" data-end="366.25">Or can we bring incentive mechanisms</span> <span data-start="366.25" data-end="369.28">so that they are compelled to do the right thing?</span> <span data-start="369.28" data-end="371.59">Now, Google is working with many CMSes</span> <span data-start="371.59" data-end="373.72">to support them in their effort as they</span> <span data-start="373.72" data-end="375.55">integrate progressive technologies</span> <span data-start="375.55" data-end="376.906">into their platform.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="376.906" data-end="378.28">So in the next few slides, we are</span> <span data-start="378.28" data-end="380.74">going to show you the results of a particular effort</span> <span data-start="380.74" data-end="384.654">that my team has followed in the context of a specific CMS.</span> <span data-start="384.654" data-end="386.32">And then later on, we are going to touch</span> <span data-start="386.32" data-end="391.84">upon some of the great work done by other CMSes.</span> <span data-start="391.84" data-end="393.28">Our team has been pursuing efforts</span> <span data-start="393.28" data-end="395.65">to bring progressive web technologies to the WordPress</span> <span data-start="395.65" data-end="396.3">ecosystems.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="396.3" data-end="398.68">The little fellow here there is Wapuu.</span> <span data-start="398.68" data-end="401.15">That is the mascot of the WordPress ecosystem.</span> <span data-start="401.15" data-end="403.54">It's not a mouse, although it looks like a mouse.</span> <span data-start="406.3" data-end="410.77">So WordPress nowadays powers about a third of the web.</span> <span data-start="410.77" data-end="414.1">So there's a lot of users creating and consuming</span> <span data-start="414.1" data-end="415.39">content on this platform.</span> <span data-start="415.39" data-end="418.45">Now, given the size and complexity of the WordPress</span> <span data-start="418.45" data-end="422.21">ecosystem, if we address the challenges that they face,</span> <span data-start="422.21" data-end="424.72">we will not have only an impact on a very large swath</span> <span data-start="424.72" data-end="427.9">of the web, but also we will be able to shed light</span> <span data-start="427.9" data-end="431.03">on how to address these challenges in other CMSes.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="431.03" data-end="433.46">So our goal with these efforts are twofold.</span> <span data-start="433.46" data-end="435.79">One is to tackle the challenges that the WordPress</span> <span data-start="435.79" data-end="439.54">ecosystem faces, and also to gather our learnings</span> <span data-start="439.54" data-end="443.47">that we get along the way and bring them over to other CMSes</span> <span data-start="443.47" data-end="446.83">in the form of objective guidance, tutorials, technology</span> <span data-start="446.83" data-end="448.64">transfers, and so on.</span> <span data-start="448.64" data-end="452.38">Now, the approach that we follow to make</span> <span data-start="452.38" data-end="455.15">WordPress more progressive consists of two parts.</span> <span data-start="455.15" data-end="459.06">The first part is leveraging the capabilities of Accelerated</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="459.06" data-end="463.51">Mobile Pages, or AMP for short.</span> <span data-start="463.51" data-end="466.66">AMP provides basically a well-lit path</span> <span data-start="466.66" data-end="469.105">to modern web development in WordPress.</span> <span data-start="469.105" data-end="472.72">AMP is an open-source web component library which</span> <span data-start="472.72" data-end="477.37">provides out-of-the-box a set of capabilities and optimizations</span> <span data-start="477.37" data-end="480.31">that are essential to achieve awesome web experiences</span> <span data-start="480.31" data-end="481.382">in the web.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="481.382" data-end="482.84">For example, coding and performance</span> <span data-start="482.84" data-end="484.81">best practices so that you don't get things</span> <span data-start="484.81" data-end="487.99">like unresponsive content when you are loading it,</span> <span data-start="487.99" data-end="491.022">or good usability so you don't have this constant shifting</span> <span data-start="491.022" data-end="492.73">in front of your eyes when you are trying</span> <span data-start="492.73" data-end="494.72">to engage with the content.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="494.72" data-end="498.28">It also provides a incentive mechanism —  for example,</span> <span data-start="498.28" data-end="500.89">the capability of getting near instant loading</span> <span data-start="500.89" data-end="504.61">time when AMP content is loaded from the AMP cache.</span> <span data-start="504.61" data-end="507.7">And it also provides a validation framework</span> <span data-start="507.7" data-end="511.3">that helps developers to bring their sites</span> <span data-start="511.3" data-end="513.64">to high-performance states and to keep them</span> <span data-start="513.64" data-end="516.22">in that state as the site evolves.</span> <span data-start="516.22" data-end="520.15">So if we enable AMP content creation in WordPress,</span> <span data-start="520.15" data-end="522.039">that means that WordPress developers</span> <span data-start="522.039" data-end="524.59">can take advantage of all these capabilities</span> <span data-start="524.59" data-end="528.07">without deviating of the normal content creation workflow</span> <span data-start="528.07" data-end="530.89">that they follow in the platform normally.</span> <span data-start="530.89" data-end="532.93">We have achieved this integration</span> <span data-start="532.93" data-end="536.59">by means of an AMP plugin for WordPress.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="536.59" data-end="540.48">Right now, it is in version 1.0 release candidate 2.</span> <span data-start="540.48" data-end="542.14">And the stable version will be released</span> <span data-start="542.14" data-end="543.84">at the end of this month.</span> <span data-start="543.84" data-end="546.25">Now, this plugin has a lot of capabilities and features.</span> <span data-start="546.25" data-end="548.86">And unfortunately, we don't have time today to go over them</span> <span data-start="548.86" data-end="549.65">in detail.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="549.65" data-end="551.92">But I want to mention a specific important one — </span> <span data-start="551.92" data-end="554.59">one that assists WordPress developers as they</span> <span data-start="554.59" data-end="558.47">build themes and plugins that are fully AMP compatible.</span> <span data-start="558.47" data-end="561.19">The plugin comes with a compatibility tool</span> <span data-start="561.19" data-end="564.31">that supports the development of AMP content in WordPress.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="564.31" data-end="568.42">In a nutshell, for any URL on a site,</span> <span data-start="568.42" data-end="571.93">the plugin tells us all information</span> <span data-start="571.93" data-end="574.83">about any error that can exist in that URL</span> <span data-start="574.83" data-end="577.03">in very minute details.</span> <span data-start="577.03" data-end="578.92">It tells you even the markup that</span> <span data-start="578.92" data-end="583.78">is generating the error and also the component in the WordPress</span> <span data-start="583.78" data-end="586.76">site that generated the markup in the first place.</span> <span data-start="586.76" data-end="587.62">We'll see the theme.</span> <span data-start="587.62" data-end="589.87">We'll see the plugin with WordPress core.</span> <span data-start="589.87" data-end="590.93">What is it?</span> <span data-start="590.93" data-end="592.96">So if you are a WordPress developer,</span> <span data-start="592.96" data-end="594.88">you can take advantage of this tool and all</span> <span data-start="594.88" data-end="596.463">the other capabilities that the plugin</span> <span data-start="596.463" data-end="601.12">provides to you to create AMP content in your website.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="601.12" data-end="603.85">If you are a developer from other CMSes,</span> <span data-start="603.85" data-end="607.81">the good news is that they are also implementing AMP.</span> <span data-start="607.81" data-end="609.22">And we are going to tell you more</span> <span data-start="609.22" data-end="611.11">about this in a little bit.</span> <span data-start="611.11" data-end="613.21">Now, the second part of our approach</span> <span data-start="613.21" data-end="615.97">of bringing progressive [? net ?] to the WordPress</span> <span data-start="615.97" data-end="619.3">ecosystem consists on integrating modern web</span> <span data-start="619.3" data-end="623.17">capabilities and APIs into WordPress core.</span> <span data-start="623.17" data-end="625.51">We want things like service workers,</span> <span data-start="625.51" data-end="627.34">streaming, background sync — </span> <span data-start="627.34" data-end="629.14">all the goodies that you have seen today,</span> <span data-start="629.14" data-end="631.42">we want them to be supported natively</span> <span data-start="631.42" data-end="633.05">in the WordPress platform.</span> <span data-start="633.05" data-end="634.78">So the goal of the integration is</span> <span data-start="634.78" data-end="637.12">that there is a consistent and unified approach</span> <span data-start="637.12" data-end="640.09">so that all WordPress developers can take advantage of them</span> <span data-start="640.09" data-end="643.06">as they develop functionality for either core or themes</span> <span data-start="643.06" data-end="644.41">or plugins.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="644.41" data-end="648.73">Now, last year, our colleague Surma,</span> <span data-start="648.73" data-end="651.19">where you have heard of him, and who, by the way,</span> <span data-start="651.19" data-end="653.77">has a complete disregard for the impossible,</span> <span data-start="653.77" data-end="657.37">he decided to show that PWA with WordPress</span> <span data-start="657.37" data-end="661.3">is actually possible by building a WordPress theme that does all</span> <span data-start="661.3" data-end="662.89">the things, as he called it.</span> <span data-start="662.89" data-end="665.62">He successfully proved his case.</span> <span data-start="665.62" data-end="669.13">And he presented his work at CDS last year.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="669.13" data-end="671.38">But he also faced many challenges along the way.</span> <span data-start="671.38" data-end="672.88">And he recognized that it would have</span> <span data-start="672.88" data-end="676.42">been super great if the WordPress platform would have</span> <span data-start="676.42" data-end="678.1">provided him with the building blocks</span> <span data-start="678.1" data-end="680.68">that he needed to build his WordPress that</span> <span data-start="680.68" data-end="683.75">does all the things in a much easier way.</span> <span data-start="683.75" data-end="686.17">So in addition to our work on AMP for WordPress,</span> <span data-start="686.17" data-end="689.07">our team focused this year on devising and implementing</span> <span data-start="689.07" data-end="691.69">the integration of some of these building blocks</span> <span data-start="691.69" data-end="695.8">into the WordPress core platform, OK?</span> <span data-start="695.8" data-end="699.22">And we emphasize the requirement of doing</span> <span data-start="699.22" data-end="703.39">that in a way that is seamlessly integrated with how WordPress</span> <span data-start="703.39" data-end="705.08">worked in the first place.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="705.08" data-end="708.22">So I would like to call my teammate Weston to tell us more</span> <span data-start="708.22" data-end="710.512">where we are in this effort.</span> <span data-start="710.512" data-end="712.898">[APPLAUSE]</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="713.398" data-end="716.77"><span class="speaker">Weston Ruter</span>: Gracias, Alberto.</span> <span data-start="716.77" data-end="719.43">Yeah, Surma certainly did build a WordPress theme</span> <span data-start="719.43" data-end="721.14">that did a lot of things.</span> <span data-start="721.14" data-end="724.95">And he had a service worker that was installed by the theme.</span> <span data-start="724.95" data-end="727.53">And that service worker powered things like offline reading</span> <span data-start="727.53" data-end="729.24">and background sync.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="729.24" data-end="731.58">It facilitated smooth page transitions</span> <span data-start="731.58" data-end="732.96">as you navigate around the site.</span> <span data-start="732.96" data-end="736.22">And while his proof of concept was compelling,</span> <span data-start="736.22" data-end="737.89">he faced a lot of challenges.</span> <span data-start="737.89" data-end="743.58">And it was because WordPress didn't allow for doing things</span> <span data-start="743.58" data-end="746.55">that he wanted to do.</span> <span data-start="746.55" data-end="748.86">But these challenges are not unique to WordPress.</span> <span data-start="748.86" data-end="750.692">They are common to other CMSes as well.</span> <span data-start="750.692" data-end="752.4">So there are a few fundamental challenges</span> <span data-start="752.4" data-end="753.87">that needed to be addressed.</span> <span data-start="753.87" data-end="755.4">The first challenge is that there</span> <span data-start="755.4" data-end="760.46">needs to be a central API in the CMS</span> <span data-start="760.46" data-end="762.86">for generating a service worker.</span> <span data-start="762.86" data-end="765.35">Because there wasn't this in WordPress,</span> <span data-start="765.35" data-end="767.87">the theme itself had to generate the service worker.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="767.87" data-end="770.48">And this is a problem because as with Highlander,</span> <span data-start="770.48" data-end="773.987">there can only be one service worker at a time.</span> <span data-start="773.987" data-end="775.82">Multiple service workers could be installed,</span> <span data-start="775.82" data-end="777.29">but only one is active.</span> <span data-start="777.29" data-end="779.69">And so a CMS like WordPress needs</span> <span data-start="779.69" data-end="783.37">to be able to generate that service worker centrally.</span> <span data-start="783.37" data-end="785.83">The next challenge is that writing service worker logic</span> <span data-start="785.83" data-end="791.14">can be complex and that the CMS should provide abstractions</span> <span data-start="791.14" data-end="794.11">as a part of it that eliminate a lot of that boilerplate code</span> <span data-start="794.11" data-end="797.41">that has to be repeated over and over again.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="797.41" data-end="800.06">And the last challenge, as Alberto referred to,</span> <span data-start="800.06" data-end="805.8">is that WordPress extension system, and other CMSes</span> <span data-start="805.8" data-end="808.47">as well, don't have sandboxing.</span> <span data-start="808.47" data-end="812.58">And so a theme or [? flagging ?] can do things that make it</span> <span data-start="812.58" data-end="815.1">difficult to maintain advanced capabilities like</span> <span data-start="815.1" data-end="816.18">the [? actual ?] model.</span> <span data-start="816.18" data-end="818.04">So we implemented abstractions in WordPress</span> <span data-start="818.04" data-end="819.51">to solve these challenges.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="819.51" data-end="822.9">And what we did is applicable to more than just WordPress.</span> <span data-start="822.9" data-end="825.21">First of all, we integrated the service worker API</span> <span data-start="825.21" data-end="828.51">into WordPress so that themes and plugins can each include</span> <span data-start="828.51" data-end="832.02">their own service worker logic and to be installed</span> <span data-start="832.02" data-end="835.77">by the single service worker that is generated by the CMS.</span> <span data-start="835.77" data-end="838.704">But this is just the base requirement.</span> <span data-start="838.704" data-end="840.12">There also needs to be, as I said,</span> <span data-start="840.12" data-end="841.98">those abstractions to make it easier</span> <span data-start="841.98" data-end="844.2">to generate the complex logic that is needed</span> <span data-start="844.2" data-end="846">to power a service worker.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="846" data-end="852.39">So our integration includes Workbox out of the box so that,</span> <span data-start="852.39" data-end="854.46">as you've heard about earlier today,</span> <span data-start="854.46" data-end="857.52">you can take advantage of all the complex logic</span> <span data-start="857.52" data-end="860.64">for generating caching strategies and other advanced</span> <span data-start="860.64" data-end="863.85">functionality, like background sync, that are part of Workbox,</span> <span data-start="863.85" data-end="866.99">and so that you don't have to reinvent the wheel.</span> <span data-start="866.99" data-end="869.9">And since WordPress developers have historically</span> <span data-start="869.9" data-end="875.21">been PHP first developers, we have included PHP abstraction</span> <span data-start="875.21" data-end="880.58">that allows you to write PHP instead of JavaScript</span> <span data-start="880.58" data-end="882.47">so that you can have a PHP call that</span> <span data-start="882.47" data-end="886.2">gets translated into the equivalent in JavaScript.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="886.2" data-end="889.6">To give you a sense for how this API is used in WordPress,</span> <span data-start="889.6" data-end="893.64">in this first example, you can see a caching strategy</span> <span data-start="893.64" data-end="896.52">being leveraged —  here, staleWhileRevalidate — </span> <span data-start="896.52" data-end="902.39">to match any request that is made to the AMP project CDN</span> <span data-start="902.39" data-end="905.53">so that it will be then served from the cache while being</span> <span data-start="905.53" data-end="907.62">updated in the background.</span> <span data-start="907.62" data-end="912.25">And here, you can see a image being precached by the service</span> <span data-start="912.25" data-end="915.31">worker and then served directly from the cache</span> <span data-start="915.31" data-end="918.28">without hitting the network at all.</span> <span data-start="918.28" data-end="920.83">And if these two examples here look familiar to you,</span> <span data-start="920.83" data-end="923.51">then that is no mistake because they're essentially</span> <span data-start="923.51" data-end="925.93">PHP versions of what you would be doing otherwise</span> <span data-start="925.93" data-end="928.54">in JavaScript via Workbox.</span> <span data-start="928.54" data-end="932.24">But if there is no abstraction in PHP for you to do that,</span> <span data-start="932.24" data-end="934.48">you can also hook directly into the service worker</span> <span data-start="934.48" data-end="937.57">to add your own arbitrary JavaScript to do more advanced</span> <span data-start="937.57" data-end="940.96">functionality, if needed.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="940.96" data-end="943.02">So given these service worker capabilities,</span> <span data-start="943.02" data-end="947.72">one common application is the App Shell model.</span> <span data-start="947.72" data-end="952.04">And App Shell facilitates those seamless page transitions</span> <span data-start="952.04" data-end="955.31">and offline interactions that you often see inside</span> <span data-start="955.31" data-end="957.89">of native applications.</span> <span data-start="957.89" data-end="961.85">But making a App Shell is often very difficult and challenging</span> <span data-start="961.85" data-end="964.2">to do in WordPress because themes and plugins can</span> <span data-start="964.2" data-end="967.07">add absolutely anything to the page, like I just said.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="967.07" data-end="970.46">And so this, again, is where the AMP plugin plays a key role</span> <span data-start="970.46" data-end="972.95">because it enforces those constraints to make sure</span> <span data-start="972.95" data-end="976.14">that the content behaves in a way that doesn't break the App</span> <span data-start="976.14" data-end="977.42">Shell model.</span> <span data-start="977.42" data-end="979.22">And AMP is also specifically designed</span> <span data-start="979.22" data-end="983.966">to be embedded inside of these kinds of experiences.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="983.966" data-end="985.34">Here is the demonstration that we</span> <span data-start="985.34" data-end="988.16">built that shows the standard theme 2017,</span> <span data-start="988.16" data-end="989.82">with a nice spinning logo for fun.</span> <span data-start="989.82" data-end="991.88">Keep watching that logo.</span> <span data-start="991.88" data-end="996.83">Notice as I open the Nav menu and start clicking around,</span> <span data-start="996.83" data-end="999.08">the content is changing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="999.08" data-end="1003.25">But the logo keeps spinning and is unchanged.</span> <span data-start="1003.25" data-end="1006.76">The header Nav menu remains expanded.</span> <span data-start="1006.76" data-end="1010.431">And you don't lose that context as you navigate around</span> <span data-start="1010.431" data-end="1010.93">the site.</span> <span data-start="1013.83" data-end="1016.8">So it's a single page application built in WordPress</span> <span data-start="1016.8" data-end="1020.78">using a standard theme as the basis.</span> <span data-start="1020.78" data-end="1023.1">And we could do it just with a minimal amount of code,</span> <span data-start="1023.1" data-end="1026.49">thanks to the foundation that the AMP plugin provides,</span> <span data-start="1026.49" data-end="1028.67">and the AMP project as well.</span> <span data-start="1028.67" data-end="1031.849">You can look at the pull request on the AMP plugin repo</span> <span data-start="1031.849" data-end="1033.95">to see more specifics on how you can</span> <span data-start="1033.95" data-end="1036.23">get started on your own themes.</span> <span data-start="1036.23" data-end="1039.819">To give you a glimpse of that, here you</span> <span data-start="1039.819" data-end="1044.01">can see the theme just has to declare theme support</span> <span data-start="1044.01" data-end="1045.43">to enforce those constraints.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1045.43" data-end="1049.762">To make sure that everything is available in AMP,</span> <span data-start="1049.762" data-end="1052.22">you have to make sure that the whole theme is able to serve</span> <span data-start="1052.22" data-end="1053.38">every page in AMP.</span> <span data-start="1053.38" data-end="1054.74">So you add this to your theme.</span> <span data-start="1057.65" data-end="1061.024">Next, you indicate the region in the template that</span> <span data-start="1061.024" data-end="1063.19">contains the content that dynamically changes as you</span> <span data-start="1063.19" data-end="1066.28">navigate around the site.</span> <span data-start="1066.28" data-end="1068.34">And lastly, you tell the AMP plugin</span> <span data-start="1068.34" data-end="1070.11">that you're opting into App Shell.</span> <span data-start="1070.11" data-end="1073.77">And then that then causes the AMP plugin to generate</span> <span data-start="1073.77" data-end="1076.83">the service worker logic to precache the App Shell</span> <span data-start="1076.83" data-end="1078.997">and to add the JavaScript to the page that will then</span> <span data-start="1078.997" data-end="1081.163">intercept the clicks, and do the history management,</span> <span data-start="1081.163" data-end="1082.14">and all that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1082.14" data-end="1085.259">And the bottom line here is that the theme developer</span> <span data-start="1085.259" data-end="1087.3">doesn't have to know the complexities of building</span> <span data-start="1087.3" data-end="1087.9">App Shell.</span> <span data-start="1087.9" data-end="1092.62">They just extend what is already in the platform.</span> <span data-start="1092.62" data-end="1095.71">But a service worker is applicable to more than just</span> <span data-start="1095.71" data-end="1096.76">App Shell.</span> <span data-start="1096.76" data-end="1099.74">It also is useful for other advanced capabilities,</span> <span data-start="1099.74" data-end="1103.61">including offline access.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1103.61" data-end="1106.1">Often, if you've developed a WordPress theme,</span> <span data-start="1106.1" data-end="1108.99">you're familiar with the 404.php template,</span> <span data-start="1108.99" data-end="1112.34">which is used to serve a page to the user when WordPress</span> <span data-start="1112.34" data-end="1113.77">can't locate the site — </span> <span data-start="1113.77" data-end="1118.43">the content that you're trying to load.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1118.43" data-end="1121.46">And in the same way, we have extended WordPress's template</span> <span data-start="1121.46" data-end="1124.04">system to introduce an offline .php,</span> <span data-start="1124.04" data-end="1127.4">which will then be served to the user when the browser</span> <span data-start="1127.4" data-end="1128.93">can't access the site.</span> <span data-start="1128.93" data-end="1131.51">And so they get that nice branded experience</span> <span data-start="1131.51" data-end="1134.02">from the theme without the dinosaur.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1137.17" data-end="1144.4">And to opt into caching pages that you visited while online,</span> <span data-start="1144.4" data-end="1147.79">you can opt into that staleWhileRevalidate strategy</span> <span data-start="1147.79" data-end="1150.46">for navigation requests so that those</span> <span data-start="1150.46" data-end="1154.07">will continue to be available when you go offline.</span> <span data-start="1154.07" data-end="1159.08">And lastly, service worker is useful for commenting offline</span> <span data-start="1159.08" data-end="1159.63">as well.</span> <span data-start="1159.63" data-end="1164.56">So here, if I try to submit a comment while online — </span> <span data-start="1164.56" data-end="1166.92">or while offline —  then the service worker</span> <span data-start="1166.92" data-end="1169.23">can intercept that request and then replay it</span> <span data-start="1169.23" data-end="1172.35">when the user comes back online via background sync.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1172.35" data-end="1173.85">And here, the developer doesn't have</span> <span data-start="1173.85" data-end="1178.41">to do anything because it's just part of the integration itself.</span> <span data-start="1178.41" data-end="1184.31">So with that in mind, I'll pass it back to Alberto</span> <span data-start="1184.31" data-end="1186.59">to talk about the road ahead.</span> <span data-start="1189.04" data-end="1191.49">[APPLAUSE]</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1191.49" data-end="1192.96"><span class="speaker">Alberto Medina</span>: Thank you, Weston.</span> <span data-start="1192.96" data-end="1196.02">This is so very good to see all these things running.</span> <span data-start="1196.02" data-end="1198.33">And we certainly have made a lot of progress</span> <span data-start="1198.33" data-end="1199.71">in the context of WordPress.</span> <span data-start="1199.71" data-end="1202.54">And other CMSes have done also a lot of progress.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1202.54" data-end="1205.66">But we are still not quite where we need to be.</span> <span data-start="1205.66" data-end="1209.31">So in the context of WordPress, the unplugging</span> <span data-start="1209.31" data-end="1210.69">is available to you today.</span> <span data-start="1210.69" data-end="1212.58">You can download it from the GitHub link.</span> <span data-start="1212.58" data-end="1215.896">So please download this [INAUDIBLE] with your site.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1215.896" data-end="1217.77">We are going to continue expanding this work,</span> <span data-start="1217.77" data-end="1221.4">integrating AMP content creation into WordPress, specifically</span> <span data-start="1221.4" data-end="1222.78">in the context of Gutenberg.</span> <span data-start="1222.78" data-end="1226.41">That is the new editing experience in that platform.</span> <span data-start="1226.41" data-end="1228.87">In the area, you know, the integration of PWA, the service</span> <span data-start="1228.87" data-end="1232.02">workers, and all the PWA capabilities into WordPress</span> <span data-start="1232.02" data-end="1234.24">core, we have made a lot of progress.</span> <span data-start="1234.24" data-end="1237.21">Right now that functionality is available in the form</span> <span data-start="1237.21" data-end="1241.79">of a feature plugin that you can also download and experiment</span> <span data-start="1241.79" data-end="1243.229">if you are a WordPress developer.</span> <span data-start="1243.229" data-end="1245.52">And we are going to continue working with the WordPress</span> <span data-start="1245.52" data-end="1247.89">ecosystem to help them to integrate these technologies</span> <span data-start="1247.89" data-end="1250.71">into their work at all levels.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1250.71" data-end="1254.04">Now, one aspect that we are working that is very exciting</span> <span data-start="1254.04" data-end="1258.66">is enabling content creators to create content easily,</span> <span data-start="1258.66" data-end="1264.06">taking advantage of new powerful format, such as AMP Stories.</span> <span data-start="1264.06" data-end="1266.31">As you can see in this example, AMP Stories</span> <span data-start="1266.31" data-end="1270.33">is a mobile-focused format for delivering rich information</span> <span data-start="1270.33" data-end="1274.32">in terms of visually rich and tap-through stories.</span> <span data-start="1274.32" data-end="1275.88">We are building an AMP Stories editor</span> <span data-start="1275.88" data-end="1278.16">for WordPress, which is also integrated</span> <span data-start="1278.16" data-end="1280.58">with Gutenberg, the new editing experience of WordPress.</span> <span data-start="1280.58" data-end="1283.26">To give you a glimpse of where we are in this work,</span> <span data-start="1283.26" data-end="1286.8">these that you see here is all the Gutenberg editing</span> <span data-start="1286.8" data-end="1287.514">experience.</span> <span data-start="1287.514" data-end="1288.93">And the good thing about Gutenberg</span> <span data-start="1288.93" data-end="1292.44">is that everything corresponds to a blog.</span> <span data-start="1292.44" data-end="1295.98">And that design premise lends itself very well</span> <span data-start="1295.98" data-end="1299.41">to create AMP Stories that also form my component.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1299.41" data-end="1302.79">So the goal of the editor is to allow users to manipulate</span> <span data-start="1302.79" data-end="1304.35">all the components of an AMP Stories,</span> <span data-start="1304.35" data-end="1306.99">control the parameters, and so on.</span> <span data-start="1306.99" data-end="1309.48">We want powerful content formats like this</span> <span data-start="1309.48" data-end="1311.909">to become available across all CMSes.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1311.909" data-end="1313.95">And one interesting development that is happening</span> <span data-start="1313.95" data-end="1315.93">is that Gutenberg is being imported</span> <span data-start="1315.93" data-end="1319.882">to Drupal, which is another popular open-source CMS.</span> <span data-start="1319.882" data-end="1321.34">and this is great because then they</span> <span data-start="1321.34" data-end="1323.91">are going to be able to take advantage of this editor</span> <span data-start="1323.91" data-end="1324.45">right away.</span> <span data-start="1324.45" data-end="1327.21">So much more on this will be coming next year.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1327.21" data-end="1329.43">So stay tuned.</span> <span data-start="1329.43" data-end="1333.27">So to conclude, I can say that the CMS space is moving forward</span> <span data-start="1333.27" data-end="1335.7">steadily along the progressive web road.</span> <span data-start="1335.7" data-end="1338.58">Google is working and supporting many of CMS platforms</span> <span data-start="1338.58" data-end="1341.43">to help them advance in this path.</span> <span data-start="1341.43" data-end="1345">And we are seeing excellent results on some fronts.</span> <span data-start="1345" data-end="1346.17">Here, we have some examples.</span> <span data-start="1346.17" data-end="1349.69">Drupal, which I mentioned, is another popular open-source</span> <span data-start="1349.69" data-end="1350.69">CMS.</span> <span data-start="1350.69" data-end="1354.09">Their developer communities is working on the AMP and PWA</span> <span data-start="1354.09" data-end="1354.616">modules.</span> <span data-start="1354.616" data-end="1355.74">They are available in-site.</span> <span data-start="1355.74" data-end="1358.19">So they are working on enhancing them.</span> <span data-start="1358.19" data-end="1360.72">Magento, which is a popular e-commerce platform,</span> <span data-start="1360.72" data-end="1363.57">they are releasing Magento 2.3 this month.</span> </p>
