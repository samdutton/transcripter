<p><span data-start="44.844" data-end="46.26"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: This is actually true.</span> <span data-start="46.26" data-end="49.75">Peter Drucker —  really, really well known kind</span> <span data-start="49.75" data-end="52.722">of business management guru.</span> <span data-start="52.722" data-end="54.18">To be honest, I think he might have</span> <span data-start="54.18" data-end="56.52">been a front-end developer, as well,</span> <span data-start="56.52" data-end="58.81">but this is just absolutely true.</span> <span data-start="58.81" data-end="62.67">If you want to make something better, step one is measure it.</span> <span data-start="62.67" data-end="65.84">And let's get into that with web performance.</span> <span data-start="65.84" data-end="68.91">To measure, we need to look at some metrics.</span> <span data-start="68.91" data-end="70.92">And it's really important to make sure</span> <span data-start="70.92" data-end="74.621">that your metrics are user centric and really focused</span> <span data-start="74.621" data-end="75.12">on the user.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="75.12" data-end="79.11">We heard a little bit ago about pending wait time and some</span> <span data-start="79.11" data-end="80.88">of those custom metrics, but we'd</span> <span data-start="80.88" data-end="82.53">like to have metrics that really focus</span> <span data-start="82.53" data-end="85.037">on how the user experience is.</span> <span data-start="85.037" data-end="87.12">So let's take a page load, break it down, and look</span> <span data-start="87.12" data-end="89.34">at a few key metrics in here.</span> <span data-start="89.34" data-end="91.53">So a little film strip here.</span> <span data-start="91.53" data-end="93.61">We're loading a search result page.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="93.61" data-end="96.51">And so we just have a little progression of a few images,</span> <span data-start="96.51" data-end="100.38">getting to our final result or where the page is done loading.</span> <span data-start="100.38" data-end="103.71">Now, underneath the things that we see visually</span> <span data-start="103.71" data-end="105.23">is a few things happening.</span> <span data-start="105.23" data-end="109.15">There's the main thread and network requests,</span> <span data-start="109.15" data-end="110.65">and these are really important, too,</span> <span data-start="110.65" data-end="113.49">because it actually weighs in a lot on the actual user</span> <span data-start="113.49" data-end="114.231">experience.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="114.231" data-end="116.73">So I want to point a few things out here, the first of which</span> <span data-start="116.73" data-end="118.175">is this point right here.</span> <span data-start="118.175" data-end="120.93">This is the first time that text shows up on the page.</span> <span data-start="120.93" data-end="122.49">It's first time the content is there.</span> <span data-start="122.49" data-end="126.66">So we call this, the duration from the navigation</span> <span data-start="126.66" data-end="131.36">to the point at which text shows up, the first contentful paint.</span> <span data-start="131.36" data-end="133.54">Easy enough —  I think we know this one.</span> <span data-start="133.54" data-end="135.06">A little bit later though, you can</span> <span data-start="135.06" data-end="138.78">see right after the main thread kind of quiets down a bit,</span> <span data-start="138.78" data-end="141.9">this right here is important moment.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="141.9" data-end="143.91">All the long tasks in the main thread have done,</span> <span data-start="143.91" data-end="147.96">so the main thread has kind of quieted down and allowed</span> <span data-start="147.96" data-end="150.81">the page to now be responsive to users</span> <span data-start="150.81" data-end="152.85">once they choose to interact with it.</span> <span data-start="152.85" data-end="154.68">Also, the network is quiet, so we</span> <span data-start="154.68" data-end="159.75">know there's no one big massive script hanging out</span> <span data-start="159.75" data-end="161.91">ready to run and take up time in the main thread.</span> <span data-start="161.91" data-end="164.52">So the duration from navigation to this point,</span> <span data-start="164.52" data-end="166.7">we call this time to interactive.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="166.7" data-end="168.45">All right, and there's one more key metric</span> <span data-start="168.45" data-end="169.95">I want to cover real quick.</span> <span data-start="169.95" data-end="175.71">Now, in this page load, a user could really</span> <span data-start="175.71" data-end="177.84">touch the screen at any point.</span> <span data-start="177.84" data-end="180.09">They could interact with it here once there's</span> <span data-start="180.09" data-end="183.75">a paint on screen or a little bit later,</span> <span data-start="183.75" data-end="186.54">but let's just say for the purposes of this,</span> <span data-start="186.54" data-end="188.6">they tap the screen at this point.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="188.6" data-end="191.64">Now, the thing is, if they tap the screen at this point,</span> <span data-start="191.64" data-end="193.92">take a look at what's happening on the main thread — </span> <span data-start="193.92" data-end="194.62">a lot of things.</span> <span data-start="194.62" data-end="197.96">We're in the middle of a big long task.</span> <span data-start="197.96" data-end="199.71">And that means the page is not going to be</span> <span data-start="199.71" data-end="202.09">able to respond to the user.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="202.09" data-end="204.96">So we have to wait a little bit until the page can actually</span> <span data-start="204.96" data-end="205.95">respond.</span> <span data-start="205.95" data-end="208.98">So this duration, the time from the input</span> <span data-start="208.98" data-end="211.87">until the end of the long task that we're dealing with,</span> <span data-start="211.87" data-end="214.774">we call this the first input delay.</span> <span data-start="214.774" data-end="216.19">This is an important metric, and I</span> <span data-start="216.19" data-end="219.88">want to spend a little bit more time on it.</span> <span data-start="219.88" data-end="222.33">If this is a main thread, well, it's</span> <span data-start="222.33" data-end="224.4">a very open and available main thread.</span> <span data-start="224.4" data-end="226.15">Really, nothing happening.</span> <span data-start="226.15" data-end="230.67">So let's say if the user had some input, well, piece</span> <span data-start="230.67" data-end="233.37">of cake, we can just reply to it immediately.</span> <span data-start="233.37" data-end="236.07">Your event handler is going to run, touch, start, or click,</span> <span data-start="236.07" data-end="237.736">or you're going to do style, and layout,</span> <span data-start="237.736" data-end="239.25">and paint, and ship a frame.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="239.25" data-end="240.541">They're going to see something.</span> <span data-start="240.541" data-end="243.61">So if, let's say, they're tapping on the Menu icon</span> <span data-start="243.61" data-end="246.79">and then the menu slides out, so we're good.</span> <span data-start="246.79" data-end="251.73">But if there is one task sitting on the main thread,</span> <span data-start="251.73" data-end="253.74">well, we're just going to have to wait.</span> <span data-start="253.74" data-end="257.279">So we always, yes, we'll be doing the event handling,</span> <span data-start="257.279" data-end="260.82">but this time between when the inputs's first received</span> <span data-start="260.82" data-end="265.14">and when the events will be dispatched,</span> <span data-start="265.14" data-end="266.91">that is the input delay.</span> <span data-start="266.91" data-end="270.24">First input delay is just the first input of the page.</span> <span data-start="270.24" data-end="272.49">It's just the first time that a user touches the page.</span> <span data-start="272.49" data-end="275.52">And the important thing here is that first input delay</span> <span data-start="275.52" data-end="279">is a field metric.</span> <span data-start="279" data-end="283.3">It really only makes sense to gather in the field.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="283.3" data-end="286.41">Time to interactive is a great and really powerful metric,</span> <span data-start="286.41" data-end="289.23">but it makes sense mostly in the lab, in a lab scenario.</span> <span data-start="289.23" data-end="292.47">And we've recognized this, that basically time to interactive</span> <span data-start="292.47" data-end="295.47">out in the field where real users are tapping on the screen</span> <span data-start="295.47" data-end="298.35">as the page is loading, it really kind of messes</span> <span data-start="298.35" data-end="300.55">with this metric.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="300.55" data-end="302.4">So there's a few metrics on the screen</span> <span data-start="302.4" data-end="305.58">here basically just outlining which</span> <span data-start="305.58" data-end="307.806">makes sense to gather in the lab,</span> <span data-start="307.806" data-end="309.93">and then some that are only exclusive in the field.</span> <span data-start="309.93" data-end="314.67">So I want to point out TTI and First Input Delay or FID are</span> <span data-start="314.67" data-end="316.14">our interactivity metrics — </span> <span data-start="316.14" data-end="320.73">really key for understanding how available the main thread is</span> <span data-start="320.73" data-end="322.14">to the user.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="322.14" data-end="324.45"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: OK, so all of these metrics</span> <span data-start="324.45" data-end="326.46">are awesome, obviously, but where can</span> <span data-start="326.46" data-end="327.63">we actually find them?</span> <span data-start="327.63" data-end="329.04">So all three of these metrics are</span> <span data-start="329.04" data-end="331.35">readily available in their respective lab and field</span> <span data-start="331.35" data-end="332.34">environments.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="332.34" data-end="334.71">So as Paul was saying, because FCP</span> <span data-start="334.71" data-end="337.26">can be measured in both the lab and in the field</span> <span data-start="337.26" data-end="339.61">with real users, it's available across the board.</span> <span data-start="339.61" data-end="342.21">So that's in Lighthouse, in the Chrome User Experience</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="342.21" data-end="346.06">Report or CrUX, and there's a web perf API.</span> <span data-start="346.06" data-end="348.15">TTI is only available in the lab,</span> <span data-start="348.15" data-end="350.91">and so can only be accessed via Lighthouse and Page Speed</span> <span data-start="350.91" data-end="352.26">Insights.</span> <span data-start="352.26" data-end="355.25">Now, FID requires real user input to measure,</span> <span data-start="355.25" data-end="357.27">so it's available in CrUX.</span> <span data-start="357.27" data-end="359.49">And FID is exciting because it's actually</span> <span data-start="359.49" data-end="362.82">going to be coming to Chrome in Q4 or early Q1</span> <span data-start="362.82" data-end="364.26">as a web perf API.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="364.26" data-end="367.821">So it should be able to give you a — </span> <span data-start="367.821" data-end="369.57">you can view it in a Performance Observer,</span> <span data-start="369.57" data-end="371.852">just as you get FCP today, which is kind of cool.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="377.612" data-end="379.32"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: So for those of you who</span> <span data-start="379.32" data-end="382.32">aren't familiar with Lighthouse, and we know that it's awesome</span> <span data-start="382.32" data-end="384.3">and a lot of people know, but Lighthouse</span> <span data-start="384.3" data-end="386.91">is an open source automated tool for improving</span> <span data-start="386.91" data-end="388.32">the quality of web pages.</span> <span data-start="388.32" data-end="390.91">So you can run it against any web page,</span> <span data-start="390.91" data-end="393.9">and that's either public or requiring authentication,</span> <span data-start="393.9" data-end="396.73">and it has audits for performance, accessibility,</span> <span data-start="396.73" data-end="399.422">PWA, and more.</span> <span data-start="399.422" data-end="401.13">I'm excited to tell you about some things</span> <span data-start="401.13" data-end="402.713">that we've been doing with Lighthouse.</span> <span data-start="402.713" data-end="406.11">So one of those things is a PWA refactor.</span> <span data-start="406.11" data-end="408.51">So currently, there is a broad spectrum</span> <span data-start="408.51" data-end="411.57">of PWA definitions in the wild that</span> <span data-start="411.57" data-end="414.42">can make it difficult to identify whether or not,</span> <span data-start="414.42" data-end="416.97">definitively, you are a PWA.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="416.97" data-end="419.73">And while our PWA checklist is absolutely wonderful,</span> <span data-start="419.73" data-end="423.84">and it gives you no helpful guidance towards what a PWA is,</span> <span data-start="423.84" data-end="427.83">we want a machine verifiable way to say yes or no.</span> <span data-start="427.83" data-end="430.77">So today, we're launching the new Lighthouse UI</span> <span data-start="430.77" data-end="436.26">with a more binary badging system for the PWA category.</span> <span data-start="436.26" data-end="440.01">And the badge groupings reflect that we want everybody</span> <span data-start="440.01" data-end="442.26">to be able to achieve the fast and reliable badge.</span> <span data-start="442.26" data-end="444.57">All experiences should be that whether or not</span> <span data-start="444.57" data-end="445.89">you're installable or not.</span> <span data-start="445.89" data-end="450.18">In order to actually become a full PWA and get that badge,</span> <span data-start="450.18" data-end="455.262">you have to successfully fulfill all audits in the categories.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="455.262" data-end="455.97"><span class="speaker">Paul Irish</span>: Yeah.</span> <span data-start="455.97" data-end="458.106">There's a few more things that we've been doing.</span> <span data-start="458.106" data-end="463.2">And in the new 4.0, 4.0 alpha that's</span> <span data-start="463.2" data-end="466.239">coming out in Lighthouse, there's a few nice changes</span> <span data-start="466.239" data-end="466.78">that we made.</span> <span data-start="466.78" data-end="467.97">So one of the things that we've been working on</span> <span data-start="467.97" data-end="469.553">is reducing the amount of time that it</span> <span data-start="469.553" data-end="471.32">takes to run Lighthouse.</span> <span data-start="471.32" data-end="473.55">Nobody wants to sit around waiting for a long time.</span> <span data-start="473.55" data-end="475.71">So we're happy to report that the median runtime</span> <span data-start="475.71" data-end="478.74">of all Lighthouse runs that we're aware of has dropped down</span> <span data-start="478.74" data-end="481.17">about 50%, and up the 90th percentile,</span> <span data-start="481.17" data-end="483.294">we've also dropped this down about 66%.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="483.294" data-end="484.71">So we're really jazzed about this.</span> <span data-start="484.71" data-end="486.51">We want to make sure that it's not</span> <span data-start="486.51" data-end="490.91">a long wait for you to get the insights that are available.</span> <span data-start="490.91" data-end="493.2">A few more changes — </span> <span data-start="493.2" data-end="497.1">we've changed how scores are kind of represented.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="497.1" data-end="499.8">So if you've seen kind of at the top of a Lighthouse report</span> <span data-start="499.8" data-end="503.13">these score gauges, right beneath them</span> <span data-start="503.13" data-end="505.23">is this little scale, right?</span> <span data-start="505.23" data-end="509.04">So this is just how the numeric scale is mapped to a color.</span> <span data-start="509.04" data-end="510.444">We made a change here.</span> <span data-start="510.444" data-end="511.86">And I just want to point out, none</span> <span data-start="511.86" data-end="515.01">of the numerical scores and those calculations</span> <span data-start="515.01" data-end="516.6">have changed in this new update.</span> <span data-start="516.6" data-end="520.84">It's just deciding which color is applied.</span> <span data-start="520.84" data-end="523.62">So this is basically the change.</span> <span data-start="523.62" data-end="528.66">We've just adjusted how the various numerical scores</span> <span data-start="528.66" data-end="529.61">map to these colors.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="567.62" data-end="571.77">A good preset maps to what real users feel.</span> <span data-start="571.77" data-end="573.39">And so really, what we want to do</span> <span data-start="573.39" data-end="575.91">is we want to capture the latency and throughput</span> <span data-start="575.91" data-end="579.09">at the 80th percentile, the frustrating experiences</span> <span data-start="579.09" data-end="583.16">that you oftentimes experience.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="583.16" data-end="588.6">And we want to keep pace with this measurement</span> <span data-start="588.6" data-end="592.65">as our global telecommunications infrastructure gets upgraded.</span> <span data-start="592.65" data-end="595.32">A lot of people are moving from 3G to 4G,</span> <span data-start="595.32" data-end="597.98">and we want to make sure that we capture that.</span> <span data-start="597.98" data-end="602.91">And so we're making a change, but actually not in the latency</span> <span data-start="602.91" data-end="604.12">and throughput numbers.</span> <span data-start="604.12" data-end="606.01">This is actually just a labeling change.</span> <span data-start="606.01" data-end="609.81">So wherever you see fast 3G today,</span> <span data-start="609.81" data-end="612.12">you'll be seeing slow 4G.</span> <span data-start="612.12" data-end="615.54">And it's actually because the preset that we use actually</span> <span data-start="615.54" data-end="619.63">captures a 4G experience more than a 3G experience.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="619.63" data-end="623.1">So just FYI, same stuff — </span> <span data-start="623.1" data-end="623.78">different now.</span> <span data-start="623.78" data-end="626.34">It's all good.</span> <span data-start="626.34" data-end="627.12">What's next?</span> <span data-start="627.12" data-end="630">Oh, yeah, so there's a few other things going on</span> <span data-start="630" data-end="632.61">with Lighthouse, really nice projects making use of it.</span> <span data-start="632.61" data-end="634.86">First up, check out some of the projects</span> <span data-start="634.86" data-end="637.02">on GitHub taking advantage of Lighthouse,</span> <span data-start="637.02" data-end="638.427">some of the dependent projects.</span> <span data-start="638.427" data-end="639.51">Really cool stuff in here.</span> <span data-start="639.51" data-end="642.21">A lot happening in the recent months.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="642.21" data-end="647.07">Many projects building systems around using Lighthouse</span> <span data-start="647.07" data-end="648.93">in a continuous integration experience</span> <span data-start="648.93" data-end="651.57">so that on every commit, you run Lighthouse, store</span> <span data-start="651.57" data-end="652.89">all that data, get graphs — </span> <span data-start="652.89" data-end="656.594">some really cool stuff happening in here, so take a look.</span> <span data-start="656.594" data-end="658.26">Lighthouse is also available in a number</span> <span data-start="658.26" data-end="661.66">of different commercial products as well.</span> <span data-start="661.66" data-end="665.34">First is Calibre —  fantastic stuff here.</span> <span data-start="665.34" data-end="667.24">Treo is another one.</span> <span data-start="667.24" data-end="671.46">I think this is my site, which is doing OK.</span> <span data-start="671.46" data-end="674.58">Accessibility actually does need some work,</span> <span data-start="674.58" data-end="676.04">but there's some nice stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="676.04" data-end="677.52">And the last is SpeedCurve, which</span> <span data-start="677.52" data-end="680.4">actually just added support for Lighthouse</span> <span data-start="680.4" data-end="681.37">just a few months ago.</span> <span data-start="681.37" data-end="683.28">So we're excited to see Lighthouse</span> <span data-start="683.28" data-end="686.667">becoming part of the production monitoring kind of ecosystem.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="686.667" data-end="688.5"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: And even internally, we're</span> <span data-start="688.5" data-end="690.91">excited to see where Lighthouse is being integrated.</span> <span data-start="690.91" data-end="693.84">So one of those examples, as was announced in the keynote,</span> <span data-start="693.84" data-end="696.3">is the new site web.dev.</span> <span data-start="696.3" data-end="699.48">And it's exciting to be integrating it</span> <span data-start="699.48" data-end="702.54">with really prescriptive, actionable guidance.</span> <span data-start="702.54" data-end="705.42">And you can run Lighthouse with any URL,</span> <span data-start="705.42" data-end="708.99">and it will provide you with a prioritized to-do list</span> <span data-start="708.99" data-end="711.69">with that guidance and interactive code</span> <span data-start="711.69" data-end="715.14">labs for the specific things that you need to work on.</span> <span data-start="715.14" data-end="718.23">What's so exciting about this is that for the first time,</span> <span data-start="718.23" data-end="722.698">tooling is directly integrated with the documentation.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="724.41" data-end="726.54"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: And we wanted to also call out</span> <span data-start="726.54" data-end="729">another wonderful partner who has done</span> <span data-start="729" data-end="731.07">a good job of using Lighthouse.</span> <span data-start="731.07" data-end="736.02">So Squarespace was able to use Lighthouse as an out-of-the-box</span> <span data-start="736.02" data-end="738.09">auditing and reporting system to build on top of.</span> <span data-start="738.09" data-end="740.7">And it allowed them to improve their 50th percentile</span> <span data-start="740.7" data-end="743.82">and 95th percentile TTI by over three times,</span> <span data-start="743.82" data-end="745.68">so we were super excited by that.</span> <span data-start="745.68" data-end="748.2">They used it to generate traces and dig that deep</span> <span data-start="748.2" data-end="750.6">into specific problems as they happened,</span> <span data-start="750.6" data-end="754.92">as opposed to post progression.</span> <span data-start="754.92" data-end="758.37">So now, we are going to talk a little bit about the Chrome</span> <span data-start="758.37" data-end="760.32">User Experience Report, or as it says,</span> <span data-start="760.32" data-end="763.92">CrUX, as I've already said, I think, three times.</span> <span data-start="763.92" data-end="766.5">CrUX actually provides user experience metrics</span> <span data-start="766.5" data-end="771.03">for how real world Chrome users experience popular destinations</span> <span data-start="771.03" data-end="771.88">on the web.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="771.88" data-end="774.21">So it's a data set that is powered by real user</span> <span data-start="774.21" data-end="778.89">measurement by key user metrics across the public web,</span> <span data-start="778.89" data-end="782.842">and it's aggregated anonymously from users who have opted in.</span> <span data-start="782.842" data-end="784.8">We're excited to talk about some of the updates</span> <span data-start="784.8" data-end="786.487">that we've done here.</span> <span data-start="786.487" data-end="788.07">One of the things, and it was actually</span> <span data-start="788.07" data-end="791.35">featured in [? Aanchal's ?] talk earlier, is regional analysis.</span> <span data-start="791.35" data-end="793.89">So we heard loud and clear from developers</span> <span data-start="793.89" data-end="796.14">that we needed to be able to break down</span> <span data-start="796.14" data-end="798.45">this data set in a country specific way,</span> <span data-start="798.45" data-end="799.59">and now you can do that.</span> <span data-start="799.59" data-end="802.8">So via BigQuery, which is where you can interact and play</span> <span data-start="802.8" data-end="806.4">with this data set you can now get separate country</span> <span data-start="806.4" data-end="809.135">specific data sets to pull it apart.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="819.44" data-end="820.58"><span class="speaker">Elizabeth Sweeny</span>: Yeah.</span> <span data-start="820.58" data-end="822.48">You can get it way easier now.</span> <span data-start="822.48" data-end="825.15">So the brand new CrUX dashboard, which</span> <span data-start="825.15" data-end="826.98">was announced just a bit ago, it allows</span> <span data-start="826.98" data-end="830.07">you to understand how an origin's performance evolves</span> <span data-start="830.07" data-end="831.34">over time.</span> <span data-start="831.34" data-end="833.01">And so it's built on Data Studio.</span> <span data-start="833.01" data-end="835.44">It's much more easily accessible,</span> <span data-start="835.44" data-end="838.74">and it can be easily customized and shared</span> <span data-start="838.74" data-end="840.2">with everyone on your team.</span> <span data-start="840.2" data-end="842.37">And it doesn't require you to write your own script</span> <span data-start="842.37" data-end="844.23">on BigQuery to access it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="844.23" data-end="846.48">And it's automatically synced with all the latest data</span> <span data-start="846.48" data-end="849.43">sets, so you're good to go.</span> <span data-start="849.43" data-end="851.73">Also, to ensure consistency across all of our tooling,</span> <span data-start="851.73" data-end="854.04">as we've mentioned, that's a huge goal for us,</span> <span data-start="854.04" data-end="860.16">FID is now launched as an experimental metric in CrUX.</span> <span data-start="860.16" data-end="863.55">So when we announced last year, the data set only</span> <span data-start="863.55" data-end="868.51">had 10,000 origins, and now we are at over 4 million.</span> <span data-start="868.51" data-end="872.46">And if you are excited to see your websites — </span> </p>

<p><span data-start="905.76" data-end="907.5">Yes, of course.</span> <span data-start="907.5" data-end="909.54">Raise your hand if you've noticed</span> <span data-start="909.54" data-end="911.91">that what you're seeing in Lighthouse and Page</span> <span data-start="911.91" data-end="913.38">Speed Insights doesn't necessarily</span> <span data-start="913.38" data-end="915.93">be telling the same story.</span> <span data-start="915.93" data-end="918.1">Yeah, I'm there with you too.</span> <span data-start="918.1" data-end="920.97">Now, we saw this was a bit of an issue,</span> <span data-start="920.97" data-end="925.62">and we wanted to improve it because we don't want advice</span> <span data-start="925.62" data-end="927.81">from two different tools that Google provides</span> <span data-start="927.81" data-end="930.1">that is kind of conflicting.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="930.1" data-end="932.31">So we've been working hard and collaborating</span> <span data-start="932.31" data-end="934.87">with the Search team on this.</span> <span data-start="934.87" data-end="937.5">And so today, we're excited to announce</span> <span data-start="937.5" data-end="940.08">that there's a brand new next generation of Page Speed</span> <span data-start="940.08" data-end="944.224">Insights now powered by Lighthouse.</span> <span data-start="944.224" data-end="945.64">And this is really exciting stuff.</span> <span data-start="945.64" data-end="947.834">So now, if you use Page Speed Insights,</span> <span data-start="947.834" data-end="950.25">all of the data that you've been seeing in Lighthouse when</span> <span data-start="950.25" data-end="953.4">it comes to performance is now in the report.</span> <span data-start="953.4" data-end="956.49">All of the metrics, and [? op trees, ?] and diagnostics</span> <span data-start="956.49" data-end="957.84">all right there.</span> <span data-start="957.84" data-end="961.17">You also see the top score that you have been</span> <span data-start="961.17" data-end="962.55">seeing in Page Speed Insights.</span> <span data-start="962.55" data-end="965.77">That score is the Lighthouse performance category score,</span> <span data-start="965.77" data-end="968.74">so kind of speaking the same language.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1002.51" data-end="1004.85">But up at the top, we have field data.</span> <span data-start="1004.85" data-end="1006.77">And by default, paid speed on sites</span> <span data-start="1006.77" data-end="1011.84">runs both analysis on mobile and desktop at the same time,</span> <span data-start="1011.84" data-end="1014.62">delivers you the results simultaneously.</span> <span data-start="1014.62" data-end="1016.83">So you can check that out.</span> <span data-start="1016.83" data-end="1020.13">So this is live today, so go check it out.</span> <span data-start="1020.13" data-end="1020.99">Take a look.</span> <span data-start="1020.99" data-end="1024.927">Give us your feedback I'm excited to have this out there.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1058.65" data-end="1062.67">So we were like, well, this kind of means</span> <span data-start="1062.67" data-end="1064.17">that in order to do this, then we're</span> <span data-start="1064.17" data-end="1065.836">going to have to have all the Lighthouse</span> <span data-start="1065.836" data-end="1068.192">data available over the API.</span> <span data-start="1068.192" data-end="1069.15">So that's what we have.</span> <span data-start="1069.15" data-end="1073.77">The new Page Speed API V5, we consider it the Lighthouse API</span> <span data-start="1073.77" data-end="1075.15">V1.</span> <span data-start="1075.15" data-end="1078.66">All the same Lighthouse data, including all categories, not</span> <span data-start="1078.66" data-end="1080.94">just performance, but all of them.</span> <span data-start="1080.94" data-end="1082.315">And all the work is done for you.</span> <span data-start="1082.315" data-end="1086.26">No waiting for your own Chrome to reload and do the analysis.</span> <span data-start="1086.26" data-end="1088.66">So we'll do the work for you.</span> <span data-start="1088.66" data-end="1096.3">And the Chrome UX Report data, that summary is still in — </span> <span data-start="1096.3" data-end="1098.25">it's added into the response.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1175.53" data-end="1178.2">If you want to make changes, test, and iterate,</span> <span data-start="1178.2" data-end="1180.39">and really have that fast feedback,</span> <span data-start="1180.39" data-end="1182.82">then the Chrome extension, the audits panel,</span> <span data-start="1182.82" data-end="1185.22">or operating within the command line interface</span> <span data-start="1185.22" data-end="1187.75">is going to be a good place to go.</span> <span data-start="1187.75" data-end="1191.34">And finally, if you want to set up production monitoring or set</span> <span data-start="1191.34" data-end="1194.59">budgets, then the API is going to be fantastic.</span> <span data-start="1194.59" data-end="1197.07">But across the entire development lifecycle,</span> <span data-start="1197.07" data-end="1199.86">you now are completely powered by Lighthouse, which</span> <span data-start="1199.86" data-end="1201.94">we're super excited about.</span> </p>
