<p><span data-start="5.958" data-end="7.5"><span class="speaker">Jonathan Chen</span>: We will talk about how</span> <span data-start="7.5" data-end="9.96">you can make the most of progressive web apps</span> <span data-start="9.96" data-end="13.65">in native environments with real world examples.</span> <span data-start="13.65" data-end="15.69">When we talk about mobile developments,</span> <span data-start="15.69" data-end="17.67">we usually think of multiple platforms</span> <span data-start="17.67" data-end="22.44">like progressive web apps, native apps on Android and iOS.</span> <span data-start="22.44" data-end="25.02">These platforms rely on different technologies</span> <span data-start="25.02" data-end="28.83">like JavaScript, Java, Objective C, or Swift.</span> <span data-start="28.83" data-end="30.81">That means you may need three different teams</span> <span data-start="30.81" data-end="33.15">to create cross platform features, which</span> <span data-start="33.15" data-end="34.71">could be very expensive.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="34.71" data-end="37.62">But from the user's perspective, these platforms</span> <span data-start="37.62" data-end="39.48">may each run similar applications</span> <span data-start="39.48" data-end="42.397">that address similar use cases.</span> <span data-start="42.397" data-end="44.73">There are many ways to reduce these duplicate department</span> <span data-start="44.73" data-end="45.938">efforts.</span> <span data-start="45.938" data-end="47.73">We are going to show you how you can better</span> <span data-start="47.73" data-end="51.72">blend your progressive web apps into native environments.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="51.72" data-end="55.2">Currently, the most popular way of embedding existing web flows</span> <span data-start="55.2" data-end="58.95">is to use WebView for Android and iOS apps.</span> <span data-start="58.95" data-end="60.99">If you are already using full screen WebView</span> <span data-start="60.99" data-end="64.26">to embed your Webflows in your Android app,</span> <span data-start="64.26" data-end="67.29">we recommend using Trusted Web Activities which</span> <span data-start="67.29" data-end="69.93">runs a full browser inside your native app,</span> <span data-start="69.93" data-end="72.612">instead of the rendering engine like in WebView.</span> <span data-start="72.612" data-end="75.36">If you already have a good progressive web app,</span> <span data-start="75.36" data-end="78.21">you can bring the same user experience to Android users</span> <span data-start="78.21" data-end="81.69">with Trusted Web Activities instead of using a full Android</span> <span data-start="81.69" data-end="82.3">app.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="82.3" data-end="84.79">Let's see how these solutions work.</span> <span data-start="84.79" data-end="87.39">Imagine that you view the web application with home,</span> <span data-start="87.39" data-end="89.61">category, and product pages.</span> <span data-start="89.61" data-end="91.41">It's a great experience for web users,</span> <span data-start="91.41" data-end="94.08">but that's not enough to cover other users.</span> <span data-start="94.08" data-end="97.89">So you hire the team to build an iOS app with identical features</span> <span data-start="97.89" data-end="100.98">to the web and another team to view the Android</span> <span data-start="100.98" data-end="103.71">app for the Play Store.</span> <span data-start="103.71" data-end="105.42">At the end, there are three teams</span> <span data-start="105.42" data-end="108.6">that work with quite different tech stacks.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="108.6" data-end="110.71">What if we made some changes to the web?</span> <span data-start="110.71" data-end="113.88">For example, a new feature on the product page.</span> <span data-start="113.88" data-end="116.62">To maintain the consistency across the platforms,</span> <span data-start="116.62" data-end="118.2">the other two teams need to implement</span> <span data-start="118.2" data-end="120.12">similar functionalities.</span> <span data-start="120.12" data-end="122.85">There is now an increased maintenance cost.</span> <span data-start="122.85" data-end="124.89">So what can we do?</span> <span data-start="124.89" data-end="127.32">Since the product page would have similar functionalities</span> <span data-start="127.32" data-end="129.449">and layout in the platforms, you may</span> <span data-start="129.449" data-end="133.11">consider using WebView as a contender in the Android</span> <span data-start="133.11" data-end="136.65">and iOS apps to embed existing web content,</span> <span data-start="136.65" data-end="139.3">just like a mini browser inside the app.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="139.3" data-end="141.06">In addition to reusable web content,</span> <span data-start="141.06" data-end="144.66">there are other advantages of using WebView.</span> <span data-start="144.66" data-end="146.4">It is easy to keep the web content up</span> <span data-start="146.4" data-end="150.58">to date without going through the app deployment process.</span> <span data-start="150.58" data-end="154.53">You may also make some native controls with web content.</span> <span data-start="154.53" data-end="157.92">For example, you can embed a product page inside the app</span> <span data-start="157.92" data-end="161.8">while keeping the native controls like navigation bar.</span> <span data-start="161.8" data-end="163.59">However, you might need some extra effort</span> <span data-start="163.59" data-end="167.01">to take a part of web content out from your existing WebView</span> <span data-start="167.01" data-end="168.6">out.</span> <span data-start="168.6" data-end="171.54">If you would like to embed entire web functionalities,</span> <span data-start="171.54" data-end="174.15">including the header, footer, menu from the web</span> <span data-start="174.15" data-end="177.96">into the apps, you may consider using the full screen WebView</span> <span data-start="177.96" data-end="183.13">to wrap the entire application inside the native app shell.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="183.13" data-end="185.56">In fact, this is a common approach used</span> <span data-start="185.56" data-end="189.02">by many Cordova beta solutions.</span> <span data-start="189.02" data-end="191.62">WebView based apps may look like native apps,</span> <span data-start="191.62" data-end="194.53">but certainly there are some caveats.</span> <span data-start="194.53" data-end="196.43">Since a WebView is just rendering engine,</span> <span data-start="196.43" data-end="198.38">a user may have a different experience</span> <span data-start="198.38" data-end="200.96">than in the full browser, such as Chrome.</span> <span data-start="200.96" data-end="204.38">For example, push notification in the payment APIs</span> <span data-start="204.38" data-end="206.09">are not supported.</span> <span data-start="206.09" data-end="209.3">Form autofills is isolated from the regular browsers.</span> <span data-start="209.3" data-end="213">Most importantly, cookies are not shareable between WebView</span> <span data-start="213" data-end="214.31">and browsers.</span> <span data-start="214.31" data-end="217.55">Hence, you may need a workaround for user authentication,</span> <span data-start="217.55" data-end="221.54">like passing tokens between the WebView and the app.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="221.54" data-end="223.94">Using the full screen WebView has been a popular way</span> <span data-start="223.94" data-end="228.92">to embed web content inside the app, but with limitations.</span> <span data-start="228.92" data-end="231.32">Next, Damien will walk us through how</span> <span data-start="231.32" data-end="234.77">we can use the power of the web without losing its capabilities</span> <span data-start="234.77" data-end="236.672">in native environments.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="236.672" data-end="238.13"><span class="speaker">Demian Renzuli</span>: If you want to have</span> <span data-start="238.13" data-end="240.95">all the advantages of the web without the limitations</span> <span data-start="240.95" data-end="246.26">of WebView, you should consider using Trusted Web Activities.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="246.26" data-end="250.67">TWA is not just a rendering engine like a WebView.</span> <span data-start="250.67" data-end="253.97">It's the full browser running in full screen mode.</span> <span data-start="253.97" data-end="257.87">For that reason, it's feature complete and evergreen.</span> <span data-start="257.87" data-end="259.91">This means that it's always up to date,</span> <span data-start="259.91" data-end="263.48">and it will give you access to the latest web APIs.</span> <span data-start="263.48" data-end="267.59">Another important aspect is that unlike WebView, the TWA</span> <span data-start="267.59" data-end="271.64">can share storage and cookies with the main browser.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="271.64" data-end="274.5">At the moment, the main limitation of a TWA</span> <span data-start="274.5" data-end="277.85">is that you can't mix web content with native controls</span> <span data-start="277.85" data-end="279.65">on the same screen.</span> <span data-start="279.65" data-end="284.03">For example, having a native toolbar at the bottom of a TWA,</span> <span data-start="284.03" data-end="286.19">it's not possible.</span> <span data-start="286.19" data-end="288.26">In cases like this, what you can do</span> <span data-start="288.26" data-end="292.01">is recreate these native controls with web technology</span> <span data-start="292.01" data-end="297.35">to provide a full web experience in TWA screens.</span> <span data-start="297.35" data-end="300.06">Regarding browser support —  at this moment,</span> <span data-start="300.06" data-end="305.3">TWAs are fully available in Chrome and in beta in Firefox.</span> <span data-start="305.3" data-end="307.97">Other browser vendors have started working on it</span> <span data-start="307.97" data-end="310.43">and will provide support for Trusted Web Activities</span> <span data-start="310.43" data-end="312.32">very soon.</span> <span data-start="312.32" data-end="314.9">Here is the flow for a common use case for Trusted Web</span> <span data-start="314.9" data-end="316.37">Activities.</span> <span data-start="316.37" data-end="319.82">In this case, users can navigate from an Android screen</span> <span data-start="319.82" data-end="325.1">to a TWA, and also from the TWA to another Android screen.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="325.1" data-end="327.86">All this happens without taking users away</span> <span data-start="327.86" data-end="330.14">from the context of the application.</span> <span data-start="330.14" data-end="333.8">Going one step farther, TWA is not only</span> <span data-start="333.8" data-end="337.95">useful for certain screens and flows inside your app.</span> <span data-start="337.95" data-end="339.89">If you have a progressive web app that</span> <span data-start="339.89" data-end="344.51">is fast, reliable, and actually looks and feel like an app,</span> <span data-start="344.51" data-end="348.07">you can use Trusted Web Activities to launch your PWA</span> <span data-start="348.07" data-end="351.2">from the other launcher.</span> <span data-start="351.2" data-end="354.5">In this case, users can arrive at the full screen PWA</span> <span data-start="354.5" data-end="357.08">by clicking on a home screen icon.</span> <span data-start="357.08" data-end="358.97">As a result, they would have the feeling</span> <span data-start="358.97" data-end="361.1">that they are opening a native application instead</span> <span data-start="361.1" data-end="362.87">of a website.</span> <span data-start="362.87" data-end="366.02">A good example of usage of this TWA use case</span> <span data-start="366.02" data-end="370.49">is Terra, one of the biggest media companies from Brazil.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="370.49" data-end="375.59">Terra stopped maintaining their native Android app in 2019.</span> <span data-start="375.59" data-end="377.93">After a while, they decided to replace it</span> <span data-start="377.93" data-end="382.4">with their progressive web app through Trusted Web Activities.</span> <span data-start="382.4" data-end="384.92">This way, they could deliver the same great experience</span> <span data-start="384.92" data-end="388.34">to web and Android users with a single code</span> <span data-start="388.34" data-end="394.25">base, while reducing the app size by 70%.</span> <span data-start="394.25" data-end="398.63">As a result, users reacted very positively to the new UX.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="398.63" data-end="400.425">The ratings in the store went up 25%.</span> <span data-start="403.31" data-end="405.17">And that's not the only case.</span> <span data-start="405.17" data-end="409.36">We already see many companies using TWA with great success</span> <span data-start="409.36" data-end="411.39">across all the regions.</span> <span data-start="411.39" data-end="417.19">Oyo, QuintoAndar, Tinder, NBT, and Rakuten Pasha</span> <span data-start="417.19" data-end="420.16">are only a few examples of companies actively using</span> <span data-start="420.16" data-end="423.81">Trusted Web Activities around the world.</span> <span data-start="423.81" data-end="426.82">So wrapping up, we have seen different ways</span> <span data-start="426.82" data-end="429.26">in which you can make the most of your web</span> <span data-start="429.26" data-end="433.12">and PWA investment in native environments.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="433.12" data-end="435.94">Here are some recommended approaches.</span> <span data-start="435.94" data-end="439.02">The most common approach is having a good progressive web</span> <span data-start="439.02" data-end="441.43">app for users coming from the web,</span> <span data-start="441.43" data-end="444.97">and also native Android and iOS apps for those searching</span> <span data-start="444.97" data-end="447.29">for your app in the stores.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="447.29" data-end="449.32">You can also reuse parts of your website,</span> <span data-start="449.32" data-end="452.63">like different flows inside your app.</span> <span data-start="452.63" data-end="456.04">This approach is commonly achieved by using WebViews.</span> <span data-start="456.04" data-end="460.48">But remember, WebView is not a full browser, just</span> <span data-start="460.48" data-end="461.86">a rendering engine.</span> <span data-start="461.86" data-end="465.38">And this has some limitations.</span> <span data-start="465.38" data-end="468.54">So if you're using full screen WebViews,</span> <span data-start="468.54" data-end="472.99">the recommended approach is to use Trusted Web Activities.</span> <span data-start="472.99" data-end="478.12">TWAs give you access to all the features, latest APIs, and also</span> <span data-start="478.12" data-end="481.99">share storage and cookies with the main browser.</span> <span data-start="481.99" data-end="485.57">Finally if you have a very good progressive web app</span> <span data-start="485.57" data-end="489.04">and would like to bring the same experience to your Android app</span> <span data-start="489.04" data-end="492.07">users, you can use Trusted Web Activities</span> <span data-start="492.07" data-end="495.16">to launch your PWA in full screen mode</span> <span data-start="495.16" data-end="498.4">from the Android launcher.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="498.4" data-end="500.645">Now you have a picture of how to blend your PWAs</span> <span data-start="500.645" data-end="502.458">into a native environment.</span> </p>
