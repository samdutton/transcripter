<p><span data-start="24.17" data-end="27.29">In a study that we did with over 1,000 participants,</span> <span data-start="27.29" data-end="29.9">we showed users a browser window where the website looks</span> <span data-start="29.9" data-end="32.21">like a Google login page, but the address bar</span> <span data-start="32.21" data-end="34.28">said tinyurl.com.</span> <span data-start="34.28" data-end="37.76">When asked to identify this website, over 85%</span> <span data-start="37.76" data-end="40.55">of participants said the website was Google.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="40.55" data-end="43.64">We're approaching this problem from a few angles.</span> <span data-start="43.64" data-end="46.67">First, we're actively combating sophisticated spoofing</span> <span data-start="46.67" data-end="49.22">techniques that abuse URLs to create</span> <span data-start="49.22" data-end="51.26">unusually deceptive attacks.</span> <span data-start="51.26" data-end="53.87">Second, we're trying to draw people's attention</span> <span data-start="53.87" data-end="56.57">to the information in URLs that's most relevant for making</span> <span data-start="56.57" data-end="58.29">security decisions.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="58.29" data-end="60.53">And finally, we're building specialized tools</span> <span data-start="60.53" data-end="63.98">to support expert use cases so that we can help make URLs</span> <span data-start="63.98" data-end="66.35">better security tools without interfering</span> <span data-start="66.35" data-end="67.73">with experts' workflows.</span> </p>
