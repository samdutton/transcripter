<p><span data-start="29.215" data-end="31.59"><span class="speaker">Cheney Tsai</span>: So since we're talking about the real world,</span> <span data-start="31.59" data-end="33.12">a real-world metaphor.</span> <span data-start="33.12" data-end="36.54">Maintaining a website is a lot like maintaining a house.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="36.54" data-end="39.06">This right here is the house that I grew up in.</span> <span data-start="39.06" data-end="41.635">It's probably not like the house that you grew up in,</span> <span data-start="41.635" data-end="44.01">just like the website you work on is different from, say,</span> <span data-start="44.01" data-end="45.42">the person over there.</span> <span data-start="45.42" data-end="46.89">But some things are the same.</span> <span data-start="46.89" data-end="48.54">You have maybe a place you sleep.</span> <span data-start="48.54" data-end="50.49">Maybe there's a dining room.</span> <span data-start="50.49" data-end="52.26">Then something breaks, like the AC,</span> <span data-start="52.26" data-end="54.46">you might say, well, I can fix it.</span> <span data-start="54.46" data-end="57.18">And your friend might say, no, you should just</span> <span data-start="57.18" data-end="58.44">call somebody, all right?</span> <span data-start="58.44" data-end="60.69">Over time, when you moved in, when</span> <span data-start="60.69" data-end="62.29">you moved to that new platform, it</span> <span data-start="62.29" data-end="64.84">might look like the room over here on the left.</span> <span data-start="64.84" data-end="66.9">But technical debt, feature creep</span> <span data-start="66.9" data-end="69.57">because Black Friday and the holiday season is coming up,</span> <span data-start="69.57" data-end="73.257">you're trying to get things in, and you get kind of messy.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="73.257" data-end="75.09">And I think that a house is a great metaphor</span> <span data-start="75.09" data-end="77.38">because it's like an e-commerce site these days.</span> <span data-start="77.38" data-end="79.41">It's not just about landing in one place and you're done.</span> <span data-start="79.41" data-end="80.368">It's about the journey.</span> <span data-start="80.368" data-end="81.812">You're going from room to room.</span> <span data-start="81.812" data-end="83.52">You're going from a page to another page,</span> <span data-start="83.52" data-end="86.659">from the home page to the search page to the checkout page.</span> <span data-start="86.659" data-end="88.95">And if the room is like this, you get kind of confused.</span> <span data-start="88.95" data-end="91.59">You don't want your user to feel confused and get lost in it.</span> <span data-start="91.59" data-end="93.12">So it's time to remodel.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="93.12" data-end="96.21">Maybe you need to upgrade your foundations.</span> <span data-start="96.21" data-end="97.95">Obviously, to remodel, we've talked</span> <span data-start="97.95" data-end="100.47">about a lot of different things throughout today</span> <span data-start="100.47" data-end="102.72">and other talks, things like that,</span> <span data-start="102.72" data-end="105.48">and like all tools in the tool box,</span> <span data-start="105.48" data-end="107.85">things like Progressive Web Apps, AMP,</span> <span data-start="107.85" data-end="110.44">Google sign in, Google Page —  they're great tools.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="110.44" data-end="112.2">But just like I can't go to the store</span> <span data-start="112.2" data-end="114.75">and buy a power drill that I saw a great commercial of,</span> <span data-start="114.75" data-end="117.13">and be like, I'm going to nail this remodel.</span> <span data-start="117.13" data-end="119.28">I could very well destroy everything.</span> <span data-start="119.28" data-end="122.28">So like all tools, just because they fit — </span> <span data-start="122.28" data-end="124.71">they're kind of like puzzle pieces.</span> <span data-start="124.71" data-end="127.4">The two pieces fit, but you might not be actually making</span> <span data-start="127.4" data-end="129.449">progress towards a big picture.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="129.449" data-end="131.05">So what's the big picture?</span> <span data-start="131.05" data-end="133.34">So at Google, we like to say, focus on the user</span> <span data-start="133.34" data-end="134.79">and all else follows.</span> <span data-start="134.79" data-end="137.095">And so we really think that that full picture</span> <span data-start="137.095" data-end="138.47">you're building towards, whatever</span> <span data-start="138.47" data-end="140.57">you choose to do in the e-commerce journey,</span> <span data-start="140.57" data-end="143.39">you need to improve user friction.</span> <span data-start="143.39" data-end="146.09">Think about if you're trying to add service workers, if you're</span> <span data-start="146.09" data-end="148.97">trying to try some of the cool, new APIs, and like, WebXR</span> <span data-start="148.97" data-end="149.93">and things like that.</span> <span data-start="149.93" data-end="153.82">How is your solution actually improving the user's journey?</span> <span data-start="153.82" data-end="155.92">Because there's no silver bullet here.</span> <span data-start="155.92" data-end="157.34">To talk about this is Ramya.</span> <span data-start="157.34" data-end="158.21">You had an example?</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="158.21" data-end="159.41"><span class="speaker">Ramya Raghavan</span>: Of course.</span> <span data-start="159.41" data-end="162.71">Saatva is a company that sells luxury mattresses.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="162.71" data-end="165.44">And they wanted to ensure that their users have</span> <span data-start="165.44" data-end="168.89">a very smooth and fast online shopping experience.</span> <span data-start="168.89" data-end="173.6">They decided to use AMP as a technology to enable that.</span> <span data-start="173.6" data-end="176.03">In their first iteration of their product details</span> <span data-start="176.03" data-end="179.39">pages where they created the AMP portion of that page,</span> <span data-start="179.39" data-end="182.75">the user had actually to click from the AMP page</span> <span data-start="182.75" data-end="185.12">to the product details page and then click again</span> <span data-start="185.12" data-end="186.8">to get to the cart page.</span> <span data-start="186.8" data-end="189.72">They realized that this was not the best user experience.</span> <span data-start="189.72" data-end="193.22">So in their second iteration, they changed the design such</span> <span data-start="193.22" data-end="196.64">that the user can see the full details of the product</span> <span data-start="196.64" data-end="200.21">within the AMP page and be able to click to add to cart,</span> <span data-start="200.21" data-end="203.22">and even see the cart from the same page.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="203.22" data-end="206.39">This resulted in a reduction of friction for the user,</span> <span data-start="206.39" data-end="209.73">going from three taps to two all in the same page</span> <span data-start="209.73" data-end="211.64">instead of three pages earlier.</span> <span data-start="211.64" data-end="213.62">The results were astounding.</span> <span data-start="213.62" data-end="215.51">Between the two iterations of AMP,</span> <span data-start="215.51" data-end="218.36">they saw a 50% improvement in conversions.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="218.36" data-end="219.35"><span class="speaker">Cheney Tsai</span>: Thanks.</span> <span data-start="219.35" data-end="221.34">So it's not just AMP.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="221.34" data-end="223.65">If you're creating things like a Progressive Web App,</span> <span data-start="223.65" data-end="224.85">you might run into this too.</span> <span data-start="224.85" data-end="226.64">So here's an example from Expedia.</span> <span data-start="226.64" data-end="229.37">Expedia has been working on a brand new front-end platform.</span> <span data-start="229.37" data-end="233.631">It's four times faster on slow 3G, on lower end devices.</span> <span data-start="233.631" data-end="234.38">It's really great.</span> <span data-start="234.38" data-end="237.11">And their CEO even recently said in their earnings</span> <span data-start="237.11" data-end="240.065">call that speed benefits deliver conversion benefits.</span> <span data-start="240.065" data-end="241.94">Usually, we'll say, we're going to stop here.</span> <span data-start="241.94" data-end="243.22">Great case study.</span> <span data-start="243.22" data-end="245.72">Instead, we're going to go into an interesting learning they</span> <span data-start="245.72" data-end="247.43">had as part of this process.</span> <span data-start="247.43" data-end="250.49">So Expedia, like many of the sites that you might work on,</span> <span data-start="250.49" data-end="251.632">is a large e-commerce site.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="251.632" data-end="254.09">They're not just going to move from one old platform that's</span> <span data-start="254.09" data-end="256.394">clearly working over to a new platform overnight.</span> <span data-start="256.394" data-end="258.019">They need to do this in a piecemeal way</span> <span data-start="258.019" data-end="261.26">because maybe some teams are on a new platform.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="261.26" data-end="263.192">They have to socialize it to other teams.</span> <span data-start="263.192" data-end="264.65">And so in doing that, they actually</span> <span data-start="264.65" data-end="266.29">learned an interesting lesson.</span> <span data-start="266.29" data-end="268.49">Users value consistency.</span> <span data-start="268.49" data-end="271.16">So some users during the migration process,</span> <span data-start="271.16" data-end="273.02">they landed on the old experience.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="273.02" data-end="274.64">And then, after clicking around, you</span> <span data-start="274.64" data-end="277.19">get put into the new experience that's faster.</span> <span data-start="277.19" data-end="279.47">And they might move back and forth a couple of times.</span> <span data-start="279.47" data-end="283.61">That population, to no surprise, actually probably did poorer</span> <span data-start="283.61" data-end="286.43">than if you just stayed in one experience or another.</span> <span data-start="286.43" data-end="288.08">It's very much like, if I was up here,</span> <span data-start="288.08" data-end="290.345">and I was wearing one brown shoe and one black shoe,</span> <span data-start="290.345" data-end="292.49">you probably couldn't take me quite as seriously</span> <span data-start="292.49" data-end="293.86">as you're taking me right now.</span> <span data-start="293.86" data-end="296.21">Hopefully, it's on the serious side.</span> <span data-start="296.21" data-end="301.4">So I think users value user journeys that are consistent.</span> <span data-start="301.4" data-end="304.235">So make sure your solutions, not only in that page</span> <span data-start="304.235" data-end="306.8">you're building, but in the entire journey</span> <span data-start="306.8" data-end="310.91">and how you're measuring it is actually reducing friction.</span> <span data-start="310.91" data-end="312.53">Of course, what I'm saying, though,</span> <span data-start="312.53" data-end="315.08">means that if your journey needs to be consistent</span> <span data-start="315.08" data-end="318.59">all the way from, say, the entry point for the search results</span> <span data-start="318.59" data-end="320.6">page to checkout, you're probably</span> <span data-start="320.6" data-end="322.237">going to run into a lot of challenges.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="322.237" data-end="324.32">So when we work with a lot of e-commerce partners,</span> <span data-start="324.32" data-end="325.984">we run into three main challenges.</span> <span data-start="325.984" data-end="327.65">Number one is something that many of you</span> <span data-start="327.65" data-end="330.08">probably think about, organizational alignment.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="330.08" data-end="332.19">Then you get to technical approach,</span> <span data-start="332.19" data-end="333.46">and then finally, measurement.</span> <span data-start="333.46" data-end="334.918">And so we'll talk about that today.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="334.918" data-end="336.41"><span class="speaker">Ramya Raghavan</span>: Of course.</span> <span data-start="336.41" data-end="338.15">Let's talk about the first challenge,</span> <span data-start="338.15" data-end="340.37">organizational alignment.</span> <span data-start="340.37" data-end="342.47">When I talk to people in e-commerce companies</span> <span data-start="342.47" data-end="345.26">and ask them, do you think investing in performance</span> <span data-start="345.26" data-end="348.83">projects to improve user experience will help improve</span> <span data-start="348.83" data-end="354.08">your core business metrics, the answer is an immediate yes.</span> <span data-start="354.08" data-end="357.62">However, when it comes time to prioritizing performance</span> <span data-start="357.62" data-end="360.14">projects, there's always several hurdles — </span> <span data-start="360.14" data-end="364.04">lack of time, lack of resources, you name it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="364.04" data-end="366.41">One of the key ingredients that's missing here</span> <span data-start="366.41" data-end="369.74">is organizational alignment.</span> <span data-start="369.74" data-end="373.31">Performance is not just an engineering priority.</span> <span data-start="373.31" data-end="374.21">Why?</span> <span data-start="374.21" data-end="375.95">Consider this.</span> <span data-start="375.95" data-end="379.07">Your content creation team wants to generate great content</span> <span data-start="379.07" data-end="380.66">for the users to consume.</span> <span data-start="380.66" data-end="382.55">However, they might create images</span> <span data-start="382.55" data-end="384.376">that are too heavy or not optimized</span> <span data-start="384.376" data-end="386.75">because they are not going through the image optimization</span> <span data-start="386.75" data-end="388.1">layer.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="388.1" data-end="390.2">The marketing team spends several dollars</span> <span data-start="390.2" data-end="392.6">to bring traffic to the site and care deeply</span> <span data-start="392.6" data-end="394.26">about the user experience.</span> <span data-start="394.26" data-end="396.74">However, they might also have tags</span> <span data-start="396.74" data-end="400.19">that are either old or redundant or obsolete.</span> <span data-start="400.19" data-end="403.67">The design team cares very much about that end-to-end</span> <span data-start="403.67" data-end="407.66">experience, but they might have some really cool new features</span> <span data-start="407.66" data-end="410.21">that do not use shared competence.</span> <span data-start="410.21" data-end="412.61">In each of these scenarios, one thing</span> <span data-start="412.61" data-end="414.89">is clear, which is that performance</span> <span data-start="414.89" data-end="418.31">needs to be a priority among every team that</span> <span data-start="418.31" data-end="423.16">affects the website and cares about user experience.</span> <span data-start="423.16" data-end="425.49">Let's look at two approaches, a top-down</span> <span data-start="425.49" data-end="427.2">and a bottom-up approach, in order</span> <span data-start="427.2" data-end="429.54">to create organizational alignment.</span> <span data-start="429.54" data-end="432.36">And we'll do this using two examples of partners,</span> <span data-start="432.36" data-end="435.81">1-800-Flowers, which is a global flower brand, and then</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="604.66" data-end="608.26">One big pattern is that we see success</span> <span data-start="608.26" data-end="610.42">in having a long-term vision and then</span> <span data-start="610.42" data-end="613.42">having achievable goals towards that vision.</span> <span data-start="613.42" data-end="614.42">To give an example — </span> <span data-start="614.42" data-end="616.12">so I was recently in Spain with my wife,</span> <span data-start="616.12" data-end="618.884">and we visited la Sagrada Familia over in Barcelona.</span> <span data-start="618.884" data-end="620.425">I think it's a great example of this.</span> <span data-start="620.425" data-end="623.5">This has been under construction for five generations.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="623.5" data-end="626.53">And yet, it still adheres to the original architect,</span> <span data-start="626.53" data-end="628.3">Gaudi's, original vision.</span> <span data-start="628.3" data-end="630.19">Despite that, even though it's still</span> <span data-start="630.19" data-end="632.68">under construction to this day, it opens its doors</span> <span data-start="632.68" data-end="634.206">to 2.5 million tourists a year.</span> <span data-start="634.206" data-end="636.58">It's actually very much like some of the e-commerce sites</span> <span data-start="636.58" data-end="637.99">that you have.</span> <span data-start="637.99" data-end="640.96">On Black Friday, not only are people going to check out,</span> <span data-start="640.96" data-end="644.95">you probably are running like 2.5 million A/B tests</span> <span data-start="644.95" data-end="646.594">through some platform.</span> <span data-start="646.594" data-end="648.01">So I think it's really interesting</span> <span data-start="648.01" data-end="649.19">to think about that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="649.19" data-end="651.91">And a lot of teams have that long-term vision,</span> <span data-start="651.91" data-end="653.59">and they often tell me that, yeah, we</span> <span data-start="653.59" data-end="655.57">want to get that time-to-interactive</span> <span data-start="655.57" data-end="657.1">to under five seconds.</span> <span data-start="657.1" data-end="659.17">But oftentimes, you find yourself,</span> <span data-start="659.17" data-end="661.54">we ran Lighthouse and we're really far away from it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="661.54" data-end="665.57">And what happens is, well, we'll get there someday.</span> <span data-start="665.57" data-end="667.84">And then there's nothing achievable to get there.</span> <span data-start="667.84" data-end="670.66">It's just something you see off in the distance in the horizon.</span> <span data-start="670.66" data-end="672.4">Oftentimes, they come back and say, well, we're just</span> <span data-start="672.4" data-end="673.87">going to have short-term goals.</span> <span data-start="673.87" data-end="674.81">And this is great.</span> <span data-start="674.81" data-end="677.11">They have sprints or everything to get quick wins.</span> <span data-start="677.11" data-end="679.18">And not to say quick wins aren't bad,</span> <span data-start="679.18" data-end="682.4">but oftentimes, you kind of get into this internal cycle of,</span> <span data-start="682.4" data-end="683.66">well, there's a deadline here.</span> <span data-start="683.66" data-end="686.245">It's something we can achieve before the holiday season.</span> <span data-start="686.245" data-end="687.37">And then that's all you do.</span> <span data-start="687.37" data-end="691.07">You go in the circles or you regress after it a little bit.</span> <span data-start="691.07" data-end="694.24">It's really important that you have both a long-term vision</span> <span data-start="694.24" data-end="696.25">and a short-term goal and you make</span> <span data-start="696.25" data-end="697.94">sure that they are actually related,</span> <span data-start="697.94" data-end="700.9">that the short-term goals is making meaningful progress</span> <span data-start="700.9" data-end="702.799">towards a long-term vision.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="702.799" data-end="704.59">Let's make this a little bit more concrete.</span> <span data-start="704.59" data-end="707.131">We all like to say it up on the stage with the other speakers</span> <span data-start="707.131" data-end="710.03">that one of the visions is to improve speed.</span> <span data-start="710.03" data-end="712.04">Obviously, what does that mean?</span> <span data-start="712.04" data-end="713.72">There's a lot different ways to measure.</span> <span data-start="713.72" data-end="716.23">So let's go back to what I was saying earlier from a user</span> <span data-start="716.23" data-end="717.07">perspective.</span> <span data-start="717.07" data-end="720.94">Improving speed might be to focus on user navigations.</span> <span data-start="720.94" data-end="724">So when we say you want to optimize your cold page load,</span> <span data-start="724" data-end="728.26">or maybe your return page load to see if you're using caching,</span> <span data-start="728.26" data-end="730.15">or if you're comparing single-page app</span> <span data-start="730.15" data-end="732.07">to multi-page app, a lot of things</span> <span data-start="732.07" data-end="735.07">we're talking about that ease, that latency between me</span> <span data-start="735.07" data-end="737.44">clicking on the user interface and the response</span> <span data-start="737.44" data-end="739.21">in your UI of something showing up.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="739.21" data-end="741.56">So let's talk about speed in that regard.</span> <span data-start="741.56" data-end="744.25">So to go back to the house really quickly,</span> <span data-start="744.25" data-end="746.8">I think doors are a great kind of example</span> <span data-start="746.8" data-end="748.11">of what navigation is.</span> <span data-start="748.11" data-end="749.8">An e-commerce site —  it's like a house.</span> <span data-start="749.8" data-end="751.247">You move from room to room.</span> <span data-start="751.247" data-end="753.58">You might come in through the back door, the front door,</span> <span data-start="753.58" data-end="754.72">or something like that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="754.72" data-end="756.58">And throughout the process, to complete</span> <span data-start="756.58" data-end="758.83">the journey in the house, like to complete the journey</span> <span data-start="758.83" data-end="761.02">on your website, you move from room to room.</span> <span data-start="761.02" data-end="764.59">On Thanksgiving, you're holding the hot turkey in the kitchen.</span> <span data-start="764.59" data-end="767.59">Do you want to mess around with the door on the left</span> <span data-start="767.59" data-end="769.3">here where you have to find one key</span> <span data-start="769.3" data-end="771.883">and then grab another key to get through the door in the back?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="771.883" data-end="773.59">It's probably not the door you want.</span> <span data-start="773.59" data-end="775.42">Likewise, there are probably experiences</span> <span data-start="775.42" data-end="777.753">in your e-commerce journey where you don't want the user</span> <span data-start="777.753" data-end="779.8">during sorting, filtering, or searching</span> <span data-start="779.8" data-end="783.16">to have to kind of pay the cost of that locked door.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="783.16" data-end="785.89">There might be a good place for you to have a door on the right</span> <span data-start="785.89" data-end="786.46">here.</span> <span data-start="786.46" data-end="788.56">I'm not saying that it's always client-side routing or anything</span> <span data-start="788.56" data-end="790.851">like that, but there are different techniques of making</span> <span data-start="790.851" data-end="792.7">that as seamless as possible.</span> <span data-start="792.7" data-end="795.6">So let's jump into three examples from Walmart, eBay,</span> <span data-start="795.6" data-end="798.03">and Airbnb, who are in different parts of this modern web</span> <span data-start="798.03" data-end="800.76">journey, and kind of dive into how they're breaking down</span> <span data-start="800.76" data-end="801.93">this process.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="801.93" data-end="803.79">Walmart's a great example — </span> <span data-start="803.79" data-end="806.04">extremely leading e-commerce site,</span> <span data-start="806.04" data-end="809.55">and it recently made a North Star Goal to reduce time</span> <span data-start="809.55" data-end="812.34">to interactive by 70% on low-end devices,</span> <span data-start="812.34" data-end="815.311">such as the iPhone 6s and Moto G4.</span> <span data-start="815.311" data-end="817.56">And this is an extremely aggressive goal to going back</span> <span data-start="817.56" data-end="818.89">to what I was saying earlier.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="818.89" data-end="821.59">But I liked that they were able to kind of make that goal.</span> <span data-start="821.59" data-end="824.222">So they organized a bunch of product and engineering teams</span> <span data-start="824.222" data-end="825.93">to make meaningful progress towards that.</span> <span data-start="825.93" data-end="829.2">And then in the last couple of months, they got 25% of the way</span> <span data-start="829.2" data-end="831.48">there with improvement on some pages.</span> <span data-start="831.48" data-end="834.69">But just because you make good progress from 0% to 25%</span> <span data-start="834.69" data-end="837.94">doesn't mean just making quick wins or the same process</span> <span data-start="837.94" data-end="840.6">is going to take you from 25% to 70%.</span> <span data-start="840.6" data-end="843.45">But that work is important because in that work they did,</span> <span data-start="843.45" data-end="845.7">they were able to show significant business</span> <span data-start="845.7" data-end="847.86">improvement and use that to socialize it</span> <span data-start="847.86" data-end="849.12">across their teams.</span> <span data-start="849.12" data-end="852.15">But what do I mean by going from 25% to 75%</span> <span data-start="852.15" data-end="854.49">might not be quite as simple?</span> <span data-start="854.49" data-end="855.73">Take this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="855.73" data-end="858.06">It's not really my kind of room, but let's say it is.</span> <span data-start="858.06" data-end="860.82">I could organize this room by just taking some books out,</span> <span data-start="860.82" data-end="863.684">and reshuffling, and making sure they're all in the same order.</span> <span data-start="863.684" data-end="865.35">But if I was going to take that strategy</span> <span data-start="865.35" data-end="867.1">and do that for everything in this room,</span> <span data-start="867.1" data-end="868.974">I don't know if I'll make meaningful progress</span> <span data-start="868.974" data-end="869.97">and finish in time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="869.97" data-end="871.02">If I'm going to clean up this room,</span> <span data-start="871.02" data-end="872.13">I might actually say, well, look,</span> <span data-start="872.13" data-end="874.32">this is kind of how I would like one shelf to look like,</span> <span data-start="874.32" data-end="876.11">but let's kind of take all the books away,</span> <span data-start="876.11" data-end="877.734">move the shelves around to actually get</span> <span data-start="877.734" data-end="879.635">a nice looking place.</span> <span data-start="879.635" data-end="881.76">Likewise, what Walmart's doing is that because they</span> <span data-start="881.76" data-end="884.392">had a North Star Goal and they made short-term progress,</span> <span data-start="884.392" data-end="886.35">they're now able to start thinking about, well,</span> <span data-start="886.35" data-end="888.45">what other larger shifts can we take to get</span> <span data-start="888.45" data-end="889.83">to the goal we want to do?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="889.83" data-end="891.48">Is it building a Progressive Web App?</span> <span data-start="891.48" data-end="893.647">Is it adding service workers in some meaningful way?</span> <span data-start="893.647" data-end="895.229">I think we're really interested to see</span> <span data-start="895.229" data-end="897.84">kind of what they're going to work on in the next year.</span> <span data-start="897.84" data-end="900.45">Speaking of service workers, eBay</span> <span data-start="900.45" data-end="902.85">is actually using one of the service worker techniques</span> <span data-start="902.85" data-end="905.67">to improve user navigation on their site.</span> <span data-start="905.67" data-end="907.71">So in one of the earlier talks, we</span> <span data-start="907.71" data-end="909.72">talked about how you can use service workers</span> <span data-start="909.72" data-end="911.25">to improve user navigations.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="927.7" data-end="930.84">So right now, if I see a camera in the search results,</span> <span data-start="930.84" data-end="933.75">I have to wait until I click on the listing,</span> <span data-start="933.75" data-end="936.36">and then the browser makes another HTML request,</span> <span data-start="936.36" data-end="938.1">and I'm waiting for that as a user.</span> <span data-start="938.1" data-end="939.96">And depending on what connection I'm in,</span> <span data-start="939.96" data-end="941.76">that could take a long time.</span> <span data-start="941.76" data-end="945.809">Well, eBay's like, if we could predict with high accuracy what</span> <span data-start="945.809" data-end="947.85">you're likely to click on —  you're going to click</span> <span data-start="947.85" data-end="949.44">on this camera right here.</span> <span data-start="949.44" data-end="951.72">What if we post message to this service worker</span> <span data-start="951.72" data-end="953.047">that particular file you need.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1019.272" data-end="1021.23">And so let's say they start diverting more user</span> <span data-start="1021.23" data-end="1023.93">traffic to take advantage of client-side routing</span> <span data-start="1023.93" data-end="1027.23">so that now 88% of search results loads</span> <span data-start="1027.23" data-end="1029.655">are leveraging the seven to eight times speed improvement.</span> <span data-start="1029.655" data-end="1031.113">Because at the end of the day, it's</span> <span data-start="1031.113" data-end="1033.53">the user's journey that matters.</span> <span data-start="1033.53" data-end="1035.369">Hopefully this is a quick example</span> <span data-start="1035.369" data-end="1037.91">of how you can keep an eye on long-term vision, wherever that</span> <span data-start="1037.91" data-end="1040.609">may be, set short-term goals, and realize that there are</span> <span data-start="1040.609" data-end="1042.109">a lot of different ways when you hit</span> <span data-start="1042.109" data-end="1044.81">different walls in those short-term goals of getting</span> <span data-start="1044.81" data-end="1047.072">to that long-term vision.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1069.53" data-end="1073.13">Even if you have a great organizational alignment</span> <span data-start="1073.13" data-end="1076.47">and a good technical approach to your project,</span> <span data-start="1076.47" data-end="1078.72">if you don't have the right measurement strategy,</span> <span data-start="1078.72" data-end="1080.697">it could still fail.</span> <span data-start="1080.697" data-end="1083.03">Because of this, even though this is the third challenge</span> <span data-start="1083.03" data-end="1086.12">we are covering here today, this is one of the first things</span> <span data-start="1086.12" data-end="1088.52">that I've seen successful companies do</span> <span data-start="1088.52" data-end="1092.81">in terms of thinking about their performance project.</span> <span data-start="1092.81" data-end="1097.01">A good measurement strategy is one that is shared, automated,</span> <span data-start="1097.01" data-end="1098.51">and actionable.</span> <span data-start="1098.51" data-end="1100.65">What do I mean by that?</span> <span data-start="1100.65" data-end="1102.63">It needs to have shared metrics.</span> <span data-start="1102.63" data-end="1106.95">To Cheney's earlier point, when you have the North Star Goal,</span> <span data-start="1106.95" data-end="1110.96">you need to have specific metrics that</span> <span data-start="1110.96" data-end="1114.32">are mapped to that North Star Goal that are also</span> <span data-start="1114.32" data-end="1118.79">shared amongst people that care about that user experience.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1118.79" data-end="1122.72">Having these shared metrics is really crucial,</span> <span data-start="1122.72" data-end="1124.31">and you have to define it in a way</span> <span data-start="1124.31" data-end="1127.13">that people understand exactly what those metrics are</span> <span data-start="1127.13" data-end="1129.41">and how they are calculated.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1129.41" data-end="1132.24">The second piece here is automated tools.</span> <span data-start="1132.24" data-end="1135.48">These tools are necessary, not just to measure these metrics,</span> <span data-start="1135.48" data-end="1139.19">but also monitor them over time so that you can gain</span> <span data-start="1139.19" data-end="1141.72">real good insights from them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1141.72" data-end="1143.27">And once you have those tools, it's</span> <span data-start="1143.27" data-end="1146.87">important to understand, what are the actionable next steps?</span> <span data-start="1146.87" data-end="1149.27">Now that I have this insight, what changes</span> <span data-start="1149.27" data-end="1152.766">can I make in order to meet that North Star Goal?</span> <span data-start="1152.766" data-end="1155.39">Let's dive into shared metrics a little bit deeper because it's</span> <span data-start="1155.39" data-end="1158.63">often not as well understood.</span> <span data-start="1158.63" data-end="1162.11">When I talk about mapping goals to specific metrics,</span> <span data-start="1162.11" data-end="1164.24">we have these four big milestones</span> <span data-start="1164.24" data-end="1167.18">when we talk about a user journey in terms</span> <span data-start="1167.18" data-end="1170.48">of acquisition, engagement, conversion, and re-engagement.</span> <span data-start="1170.48" data-end="1173.24">Let's focus more on the conversion piece.</span> <span data-start="1173.24" data-end="1176.27">Let's say you really wanted a seamless checkout experience</span> <span data-start="1176.27" data-end="1177.65">for your users.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1177.65" data-end="1182.33">One way to measure that is to think about the average time</span> <span data-start="1182.33" data-end="1186.17">that it takes for, let's say, 90% of your users</span> <span data-start="1186.17" data-end="1191.48">to go from that cart page to the order completion page.</span> <span data-start="1191.48" data-end="1193.49">Understanding from a user perspective</span> <span data-start="1193.49" data-end="1195.5">how easy or difficult it is for them</span> <span data-start="1195.5" data-end="1197.96">to convert when that intent is clear</span> <span data-start="1197.96" data-end="1202.46">is a good way, potentially, for measuring whether you're having</span> <span data-start="1202.46" data-end="1205.32">a seamless checkout flow.</span> <span data-start="1205.32" data-end="1208.74">Another important point to consider is third parties.</span> <span data-start="1208.74" data-end="1211.95">Third parties are an integral part of that user experience</span> <span data-start="1211.95" data-end="1212.766">on your site.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1212.766" data-end="1214.14">And therefore, they should not be</span> <span data-start="1214.14" data-end="1217.14">ignored when it comes to measurement strategy either.</span> <span data-start="1217.14" data-end="1219.75">So one way you can hold your third party accountable</span> <span data-start="1219.75" data-end="1221.4">is to say that the server response</span> <span data-start="1221.4" data-end="1225.56">time should be under a certain budget that you set for them.</span> <span data-start="1225.56" data-end="1227.81">All in all, talking about budgets,</span> <span data-start="1227.81" data-end="1231.05">you've been hearing this term of performance budgets</span> <span data-start="1231.05" data-end="1233.81">throughout various sessions today.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1233.81" data-end="1235.67">A performance budget is a framework</span> <span data-start="1235.67" data-end="1239.18">that allows you to understand what changes represent progress</span> <span data-start="1239.18" data-end="1243.08">and what changes represent regressions.</span> <span data-start="1243.08" data-end="1247.04">And it does take into account the set of shared metrics,</span> <span data-start="1247.04" data-end="1250.04">and you have budgets for each of those metrics, which</span> <span data-start="1250.04" data-end="1255.35">are shown in this automated tool and made actionable.</span> <span data-start="1255.35" data-end="1256.73">Let's actually take a look at how</span> <span data-start="1256.73" data-end="1258.41">three different e-commerce companies</span> <span data-start="1258.41" data-end="1261.2">took this idea of a performance budget</span> <span data-start="1261.2" data-end="1263.33">and implemented it so well that they</span> <span data-start="1263.33" data-end="1265.47">have seen some amazing results.</span> <span data-start="1265.47" data-end="1267.72">Are you ready?</span> <span data-start="1267.72" data-end="1272.81">OK, Cdiscount is a French leader in e-commerce</span> <span data-start="1272.81" data-end="1276.98">that had a problem that is not very unlike many of us</span> <span data-start="1276.98" data-end="1278.39">in e-commerce.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1278.39" data-end="1282.74">They saw a big chunk of their traffic on mobile,</span> <span data-start="1282.74" data-end="1285.83">but they didn't see that the mobile sales were</span> <span data-start="1285.83" data-end="1288.11">at a similar ratio.</span> <span data-start="1288.11" data-end="1290.82">They realized that this is not an easy problem to solve,</span> <span data-start="1290.82" data-end="1291.71">right?</span> <span data-start="1291.71" data-end="1294.08">So they broke organizational silos,</span> <span data-start="1294.08" data-end="1296.15">and they empowered their marketing team</span> <span data-start="1296.15" data-end="1298.73">to run deep analysis and come up with a set</span> <span data-start="1298.73" data-end="1300.95">of shared best practices.</span> <span data-start="1300.95" data-end="1304.52">They then implemented these best practices as budgets</span> <span data-start="1304.52" data-end="1305.81">within their tool.</span> <span data-start="1305.81" data-end="1310.73">And using the integration between SpeedCurve and Slack,</span> <span data-start="1310.73" data-end="1313.46">they ensured that when the budgets were not met,</span> <span data-start="1313.46" data-end="1316.55">automatic alerts would be sent into the Slack channel which</span> <span data-start="1316.55" data-end="1319.79">was shared amongst all the cross-functional teams.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1319.79" data-end="1323.19">By collaborating in making all of these different changes,</span> <span data-start="1323.19" data-end="1326.49">they saw some really, really good results.</span> <span data-start="1326.49" data-end="1329.09">Their mobile website conversion rate</span> <span data-start="1329.09" data-end="1333.09">was 50% higher than their native app, which has a 4,</span> <span data-start="1333.09" data-end="1336.78">4 and 1/2 star in different app stores.</span> <span data-start="1336.78" data-end="1340.68">This is something that all of us really can relate to, right?</span> <span data-start="1340.68" data-end="1343.96">It's not easy to get there.</span> <span data-start="1343.96" data-end="1345.93">Let's take another example.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1345.93" data-end="1351.39">Carousell, which is a Singapore-based online</span> <span data-start="1351.39" data-end="1356.7">marketplace, used this idea of a performance budget because they</span> <span data-start="1356.7" data-end="1360.72">really wanted their users in southeast Asian countries where</span> <span data-start="1360.72" data-end="1364.29">the predominant network speed is 3G — </span> <span data-start="1364.29" data-end="1368.22">they wanted all of those users to have a great experience</span> <span data-start="1368.22" data-end="1370.02">on their site.</span> <span data-start="1370.02" data-end="1371.79">And so they started off with this kind</span> <span data-start="1371.79" data-end="1373.23">of performance budget.</span> <span data-start="1373.23" data-end="1377.28">Note that the first line here is about the critical rendering</span> <span data-start="1377.28" data-end="1383.01">path resources bundle to be under 120 KB.</span> <span data-start="1383.01" data-end="1385.77">This is irrespective of whether that bundle includes</span> <span data-start="1385.77" data-end="1387.54">first party or third party because they</span> <span data-start="1387.54" data-end="1390.15">had this commitment that that bundle needs</span> <span data-start="1390.15" data-end="1393.37">to be really small.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1393.37" data-end="1396.45">They were so intent upon following this performance</span> <span data-start="1396.45" data-end="1398.55">budget that they included this as part</span> <span data-start="1398.55" data-end="1401.01">of their continuous integration process, such</span> <span data-start="1401.01" data-end="1402.93">that the code could not be merged</span> <span data-start="1402.93" data-end="1407.82">until this bundle or this budget was met.</span> <span data-start="1407.82" data-end="1410.66">In order to do that, it was not an easy thing at all,</span> <span data-start="1410.66" data-end="1413.04">so they really had to collaborate very, very</span> <span data-start="1413.04" data-end="1416.91">closely with their design, and marketing, and analytics teams,</span> <span data-start="1416.91" data-end="1419.55">and that really paid off very well, as you</span> <span data-start="1419.55" data-end="1421.5">can see in this next slide.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1421.5" data-end="1423.45">Not only are these metrics really good,</span> <span data-start="1423.45" data-end="1426.03">but there's something here for every team that</span> <span data-start="1426.03" data-end="1427.86">was part of this project.</span> <span data-start="1427.86" data-end="1430.92">The product team cares about the page load time.</span> <span data-start="1430.92" data-end="1434.58">The marketing team cared about organic traffic.</span> <span data-start="1434.58" data-end="1437.16">The ads team cared about the click-through rates.</span> <span data-start="1437.16" data-end="1439.29">And the transactions team cared about how many</span> <span data-start="1439.29" data-end="1441.96">buyers and sellers were able to chat with each other</span> <span data-start="1441.96" data-end="1443.8">to complete their transaction.</span> <span data-start="1443.8" data-end="1447.33">So these were great results all in all.</span> <span data-start="1447.33" data-end="1449.12">Let's look at a third example.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1449.12" data-end="1452.6">As you heard earlier today about Wayfair, the home goods company</span> <span data-start="1452.6" data-end="1455.42">here in the US, that really wanted</span> <span data-start="1455.42" data-end="1458.9">to improve user experience and make sure that they</span> <span data-start="1458.9" data-end="1462.51">sustained that improvement.</span> <span data-start="1462.51" data-end="1465.3">When they first started off with the performance budget, which</span> <span data-start="1465.3" data-end="1468.06">they said was one of the most crucial parts</span> <span data-start="1468.06" data-end="1470.97">of the measurement that they did,</span> <span data-start="1470.97" data-end="1474.54">it did not take off that much because these budgets were</span> <span data-start="1474.54" data-end="1478.41">understood, but it was not very clear for everybody.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1478.41" data-end="1481.47">Well, they made so many changes towards optimizing</span> <span data-start="1481.47" data-end="1483.18">their [? inside, ?] they said that one</span> <span data-start="1483.18" data-end="1485.28">of the most important things they did</span> <span data-start="1485.28" data-end="1488.23">was to socialize their budget.</span> <span data-start="1488.23" data-end="1490.9">And the way they did that was to make it clear</span> <span data-start="1490.9" data-end="1494.72">using performance indicators, as you see here in colors.</span> <span data-start="1494.72" data-end="1496.4">So this is how it worked.</span> <span data-start="1496.4" data-end="1499.33">They had a budget, and they had an acceptable variance of plus</span> <span data-start="1499.33" data-end="1500.72">or minus 10%.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1500.72" data-end="1504.59">So if you were within that range, you're in orange.</span> <span data-start="1504.59" data-end="1507.31">If you exceed that budget by more than 10%,</span> <span data-start="1507.31" data-end="1509.8">then you enter the red area.</span> <span data-start="1509.8" data-end="1512.297">And if you're better than the budget by more than 10%,</span> <span data-start="1512.297" data-end="1513.38">then you've hit your goal.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1513.38" data-end="1515.65">Congratulations, you're a green.</span> <span data-start="1515.65" data-end="1520.72">They also had a competitor line, just to make things fun.</span> <span data-start="1520.72" data-end="1523.27">This is how it looked for all internal users</span> <span data-start="1523.27" data-end="1525.76">when they looked at their specific pages</span> <span data-start="1525.76" data-end="1529.12">since the budgets were set at a page-type level</span> <span data-start="1529.12" data-end="1531.76">for every route in the site.</span> <span data-start="1531.76" data-end="1535.51">So the moment you look at your mobile site within the company,</span> <span data-start="1535.51" data-end="1538.33">you were able to see these indicators that</span> <span data-start="1538.33" data-end="1542.97">told you whether you are in the red, green, or orange.</span> <span data-start="1542.97" data-end="1544.66">As you can see here, the way they</span> <span data-start="1544.66" data-end="1548.97">set these budgets was the moment you hit the goal reliably,</span> <span data-start="1548.97" data-end="1550.68">your budget, and therefore, goal,</span> <span data-start="1550.68" data-end="1553.92">which was always 10% better than the budget,</span> <span data-start="1553.92" data-end="1555.24">tightened up a little bit.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1555.24" data-end="1558.27">You can see that over here, where once you hit the goal,</span> <span data-start="1558.27" data-end="1562.08">the bar was raised, so to speak, and it actually</span> <span data-start="1562.08" data-end="1563.76">tightened up over there.</span> <span data-start="1563.76" data-end="1565.65">By the way, isn't this the kind of graph</span> <span data-start="1565.65" data-end="1570">we all want to see, going from 2.3 seconds to 0.9 seconds?</span> <span data-start="1570" data-end="1572.95">That's really awesome.</span> <span data-start="1572.95" data-end="1576.24">This is a performance portal.</span> <span data-start="1576.24" data-end="1577.83">As you can see, in this portal, they</span> <span data-start="1577.83" data-end="1581.1">had a clear set of shared metrics.</span> <span data-start="1581.1" data-end="1584.82">Not just the metrics, but also the page level indicator,</span> <span data-start="1584.82" data-end="1588.15">and they have a call to action at the bottom for users</span> <span data-start="1588.15" data-end="1591.2">to basically reach out to a Slack channel</span> <span data-start="1591.2" data-end="1592.95">if they had questions about these metrics.</span> <span data-start="1595.83" data-end="1599.36">Whether you're trying to use a performance budget idea</span> <span data-start="1599.36" data-end="1602.78">or trying to use the general idea of a shared metrics</span> <span data-start="1602.78" data-end="1606.27">automated tool and actionable next steps,</span> <span data-start="1606.27" data-end="1608.03">thinking about your measurement strategy</span> <span data-start="1608.03" data-end="1609.95">at the beginning of your project is</span> <span data-start="1609.95" data-end="1613.06">crucial to the success of the project.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1613.06" data-end="1615.77">Another thing to remember about performance budgets</span> <span data-start="1615.77" data-end="1618.02">is that it needs governance to think</span> <span data-start="1618.02" data-end="1620.48">about the metrics at a page or route level,</span> <span data-start="1620.48" data-end="1623.54">and also to maintain those budgets and metrics as moving</span> <span data-start="1623.54" data-end="1626.62">targets as you go forward.</span> <span data-start="1626.62" data-end="1628.8">It also needs to be enforced in a way</span> <span data-start="1628.8" data-end="1633.63">that everybody can come together to meet or beat those budgets.</span> <span data-start="1633.63" data-end="1637.976">And that makes it very, very successful.</span> </p>
