<section><span data-start="35.47" data-end="38.92"><span class="speaker">Rudy Galfi</span>: All right, so here's a slide showing a slide.</span> <span data-start="38.92" data-end="41.62">To be more precise, this is one of those old school</span> <span data-start="41.62" data-end="44.169">projector slides.</span> <span data-start="44.169" data-end="46.21">In their day, slides like these were a useful way</span> <span data-start="46.21" data-end="49.77">to communicate, or held important memories for people.</span> <span data-start="49.77" data-end="51.52">To view the slide's content, the projector</span> <span data-start="51.52" data-end="53.29">needed to mechanically position it</span> <span data-start="53.29" data-end="56.629">into place, so that the light source would shine through it.</span> <span data-start="56.629" data-end="58.42">And for those of you who might have watched</span> <span data-start="58.42" data-end="59.92">one of these old school slide shows,</span> <span data-start="59.92" data-end="61.56">you probably remember how tedious</span> <span data-start="61.56" data-end="64.16">it was to progress through each slide.</span> <span data-start="64.16" data-end="67.15">This kind of makes me feel, you know,</span> <span data-start="67.15" data-end="71.31">like how we think about the web today, the same feeling.</span> <span data-start="71.31" data-end="73.59">Just like progressing through cylinder slides, when</span> <span data-start="73.59" data-end="84.26">you browse the web today you can feel all the navigations.</span> <span data-start="84.26" data-end="86.69">Today the web is used a lot on the go,</span> <span data-start="86.69" data-end="89.62">say in between meetings, in an elevator,</span> <span data-start="89.62" data-end="91.85">or maybe you're on a poor connection.</span> <span data-start="91.85" data-end="93.95">When I've got limited time, focused on my phone</span> <span data-start="93.95" data-end="96.11">before the next distraction comes along,</span> <span data-start="96.11" data-end="99.54">spending five seconds or longer staring at a white screen,</span> <span data-start="99.54" data-end="101.33">waiting for the content to come in,</span> <span data-start="101.33" data-end="105.799">for the page to be interactive, that's incredibly noticeable.</span> <span data-start="105.799" data-end="107.34">Many of you may have observed we used</span> <span data-start="107.34" data-end="109.76">some exaggerated long transitions on our own</span> <span data-start="109.76" data-end="111.26">slides so far in this talk.</span> <span data-start="111.26" data-end="112.22">Don't worry.</span> <span data-start="112.22" data-end="114.05">We're going to put an end to that soon.</span> <span data-start="114.05" data-end="116.12">Those were just one second fades.</span> <span data-start="116.12" data-end="118.65">Think of how used to the cycle of reading</span> <span data-start="118.65" data-end="121.16">and then waiting, reading and then waiting,</span> <span data-start="121.16" data-end="123.76">that we've kind of grown used to.</span> <span data-start="123.76" data-end="125.446">We think it's time to do better.</span> <span data-start="125.446" data-end="127.57">And we have some ideas to help you create seamless,</span> <span data-start="127.57" data-end="129.53">zero friction user experiences.</span> <span data-start="129.53" data-end="131.92">And that's what this talk is all about.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="131.92" data-end="133.46"><span class="speaker">Kinuko Yasuda</span>: So our desire to see</span> <span data-start="133.46" data-end="136.6">seamless user experience on the web, it's not new.</span> <span data-start="136.6" data-end="139.66">In Chrome 13 back in 2011, we launched</span> <span data-start="139.66" data-end="142.86">a feature called Instant Search, which provides the search</span> <span data-start="142.86" data-end="145.03">abilities for user experience.</span> <span data-start="145.03" data-end="148.48">It did so by pairing the [INAUDIBLE] user would</span> <span data-start="148.48" data-end="150.16">most likely click on.</span> <span data-start="150.16" data-end="153.31">However, the feature only worked in limited scenarios</span> <span data-start="153.31" data-end="154.57">for various reasons.</span> <span data-start="154.57" data-end="157.09">In particular, for privacy reason</span> <span data-start="157.09" data-end="159.31">it only worked for the search results</span> <span data-start="159.31" data-end="161.68">the user had already visited and for which</span> <span data-start="161.68" data-end="165.24">we had a high confidence of user interest.</span> <span data-start="165.24" data-end="169.21">Then in 2015, another example with [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span data-start="169.21" data-end="171.1">user experience was launched.</span> <span data-start="171.1" data-end="173.04">I'm talking about AMP.</span> <span data-start="173.04" data-end="175.36">Rudy is going to walk us through what it took,</span> <span data-start="175.36" data-end="177.354">and where things are headed.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="177.354" data-end="179.02"><span class="speaker">Rudy Galfi</span>: So as Kinuko said, advancing</span> <span data-start="179.02" data-end="180.52">the state of the art in page loading</span> <span data-start="180.52" data-end="183.31">has always been of intense interest to us at Google,</span> <span data-start="183.31" data-end="184.48">and for Google Search.</span> <span data-start="184.48" data-end="187.06">We point users to a whole lot of web pages.</span> <span data-start="187.06" data-end="189.46">And thinking about the totality of the experience</span> <span data-start="189.46" data-end="191.14">that the user gets, we really want</span> <span data-start="191.14" data-end="193.72">it to feel as fast and as seamless as possible,</span> <span data-start="193.72" data-end="196.03">even as the user goes off of Search</span> <span data-start="196.03" data-end="197.95">and into the whole great world of content</span> <span data-start="197.95" data-end="199.927">that they're looking to explore.</span> <span data-start="199.927" data-end="201.76">When we started AMP, we were intent on using</span> <span data-start="201.76" data-end="204.4">the full power of the web platform that was available.</span> <span data-start="204.4" data-end="206.65">But where we wanted to get was here.</span> <span data-start="206.65" data-end="208.27">And we felt that what we could achieve</span> <span data-start="208.27" data-end="213.336">in a scalable way on the web kind of just got us up to here.</span> <span data-start="213.336" data-end="214.71">So we gave it a bunch of thought,</span> <span data-start="214.71" data-end="217.32">and came up with an architecture for instant loading</span> <span data-start="217.32" data-end="219.03">that could work on today's web.</span> <span data-start="219.03" data-end="220.74">It's still what we use today.</span> <span data-start="220.74" data-end="223.14">First, there's the AMP JavaScript library.</span> <span data-start="223.14" data-end="226.59">It helps to ensure that the experience is fast by default.</span> <span data-start="226.59" data-end="228.87">And this is enforced by a validation step, which</span> <span data-start="228.87" data-end="230.46">helps keep the experience fast, even</span> <span data-start="230.46" data-end="232.71">as the site is getting updated.</span> <span data-start="232.71" data-end="236.07">The next layer was thinking about how server response</span> <span data-start="236.07" data-end="237.93">times can vary a lot globally.</span> <span data-start="237.93" data-end="241.29">And not every site is situated on great infrastructure.</span> <span data-start="241.29" data-end="243.9">Also, as we've seen earlier, sticking huge images</span> <span data-start="243.9" data-end="246.977">into pages intended for mobile viewing is still pretty common.</span> <span data-start="246.977" data-end="249.06">And so for these reasons we added the second layer</span> <span data-start="249.06" data-end="252.15">of caching, where we can ensure that the content is</span> <span data-start="252.15" data-end="255">pushed to the edges of the network for faster delivery.</span> <span data-start="255" data-end="257.73">And we can do common sense optimizations.</span> <span data-start="257.73" data-end="259.879">And last, truly the best thing we</span> <span data-start="259.879" data-end="261.42">can do to get load times down to zero</span> <span data-start="261.42" data-end="264.05">milliseconds is to prerender the content,</span> <span data-start="264.05" data-end="266.01">use our psychic powers.</span> <span data-start="266.01" data-end="269.34">As we just discussed, this was attempted in Search before</span> <span data-start="269.34" data-end="270.19">with Instant Search.</span> <span data-start="270.19" data-end="272.37">However, you need to think really</span> <span data-start="272.37" data-end="275.52">carefully about the privacy implications of such a design.</span> <span data-start="275.52" data-end="277.98">And we had trouble scaling it.</span> <span data-start="277.98" data-end="280.77">The cache will actually help us complement this prerendering</span> <span data-start="280.77" data-end="281.67">very well.</span> <span data-start="281.67" data-end="285.65">And Kinuko will explain more about that in a moment.</span> <span data-start="285.65" data-end="286.99">So we got all of this stood up.</span> <span data-start="286.99" data-end="289.312">And this is where we ended up.</span> <span data-start="289.312" data-end="290.77">Most of what you're looking at here</span> <span data-start="290.77" data-end="292.21">is what we call the AMP viewer.</span> <span data-start="292.21" data-end="294.47">That's the page you're visiting.</span> <span data-start="294.47" data-end="296.85">It's responsible for displaying the content served</span> <span data-start="296.85" data-end="299.764">through the AMP cache for speed and privacy reasons.</span> <span data-start="299.764" data-end="301.93">However, you'll notice by looking at the address bar</span> <span data-start="301.93" data-end="305.11">that the URL is still saying google.com in it.</span> <span data-start="305.11" data-end="307.06">To help the user understand where</span> <span data-start="307.06" data-end="308.83">the content they're viewing came from,</span> <span data-start="308.83" data-end="310.65">we had to add an extra piece of UX</span> <span data-start="310.65" data-end="313.48">to the top of the content area of the page.</span> <span data-start="313.48" data-end="315.49">The idea of the instant loading was achieved.</span> <span data-start="315.49" data-end="317.53">But the design constraints that we faced</span> <span data-start="317.53" data-end="320.5">and the work arounds that we had to build for them ended up</span> <span data-start="320.5" data-end="323.53">being put on full display in the product experience,</span> <span data-start="323.53" data-end="325.39">and that wasn't great.</span> <span data-start="325.39" data-end="327.94">So we hear a bunch of feedback on this, maybe even</span> <span data-start="327.94" data-end="329.32">from some of you.</span> <span data-start="329.32" data-end="330.82">So earlier this year we started down</span> <span data-start="330.82" data-end="334.58">this path to make the URLs for AMP pages better.</span> <span data-start="334.58" data-end="337.18">And after having AMP in the wild for two years,</span> <span data-start="337.18" data-end="339.767">we decided it was time to take all that we had learned</span> <span data-start="339.767" data-end="342.1">and develop the necessary primitives in the web platform</span> <span data-start="342.1" data-end="343.04">directly.</span> <span data-start="343.04" data-end="345.67">So we could make all the content across the web</span> <span data-start="345.67" data-end="348.947">be able to benefit from this kind of technology.</span> <span data-start="348.947" data-end="350.53">So this means that for the cases where</span> <span data-start="350.53" data-end="352.72">you click on a link in Search and it's just</span> <span data-start="352.72" data-end="355.414">a simple navigation, then we want the publisher's URL</span> <span data-start="355.414" data-end="357.58">to be the one that shows up in the browser's address</span> <span data-start="357.58" data-end="360.58">bar, while still having the instant, or nearly instant,</span> <span data-start="360.58" data-end="361.56">loading experience.</span> </section>

<section><span data-start="364.315" data-end="366.19"><span class="speaker">Kinuko Yasuda</span>: So Rudy talked a lot about the</span> <span data-start="366.19" data-end="368.83">how AMP has been pushing with the goal of highly</span> <span data-start="368.83" data-end="371.47">optimized user experience.</span> <span data-start="371.47" data-end="374.13">There was a lot of special handling required because</span> <span data-start="374.13" data-end="376.72">of a gap in the web platform.</span> <span data-start="376.72" data-end="379.42">We are now taking inspiration from past efforts,</span> <span data-start="379.42" data-end="381.79">like AMP and the Instant Search, and trying</span> <span data-start="381.79" data-end="386.33">to eliminate this gap by extending the web platform.</span> <span data-start="386.33" data-end="390.1">And by doing so, we also want to enable this zero friction user</span> <span data-start="390.1" data-end="395.05">experience across all content on the web.</span> <span data-start="395.05" data-end="398.38">We are working on multiple proposals to achieve this goal.</span> <span data-start="398.38" data-end="401.37">But in this talk, we'll introduce two new [INAUDIBLE],,</span> <span data-start="401.37" data-end="403.88">web packaging and portals.</span> <span data-start="403.88" data-end="406.56">So let me start with web packaging.</span> <span data-start="406.56" data-end="409.57">As the name implies, it's meant for packaging</span> <span data-start="409.57" data-end="411.22">a piece of web content.</span> <span data-start="411.22" data-end="414.28">We think it will enable various interesting use cases.</span> <span data-start="414.28" data-end="417.25">But let me start first explaining</span> <span data-start="417.25" data-end="420.31">how it can help instant navigation both for AMP</span> <span data-start="420.31" data-end="423.13">and non-AMP content.</span> <span data-start="423.13" data-end="427.44">So stepping back, [INAUDIBLE] wanted to make web content</span> <span data-start="427.44" data-end="430.5">load instantly and reliably.</span> <span data-start="430.5" data-end="432.24">Here's why it's hard.</span> <span data-start="432.24" data-end="434.97">When you publish something on the web,</span> <span data-start="434.97" data-end="437.76">in the simplest setting, you'd have a server.</span> <span data-start="437.76" data-end="440.28">And your content would be a project there.</span> <span data-start="440.28" data-end="442.68">Then someone browses your content.</span> <span data-start="442.68" data-end="445.31">But the server might be overloaded.</span> <span data-start="445.31" data-end="448.52">And your content will load slowly.</span> <span data-start="448.52" data-end="450.73">Then the experience not good.</span> <span data-start="450.73" data-end="452.88">So what could we do to improve this?</span> <span data-start="452.88" data-end="455.88">One way would be to prefetch your content.</span> <span data-start="455.88" data-end="458.88">Suppose that your content's linked from a popular traffic</span> <span data-start="458.88" data-end="460.08">source site.</span> <span data-start="460.08" data-end="463.09">When a user visits the site, it can trigger a prefetch</span> <span data-start="463.09" data-end="467.12">when it thinks that the user is about to visit your content.</span> <span data-start="467.12" data-end="470.79">Then because the content is already in the user's cache,</span> <span data-start="470.79" data-end="474.53">the navigations happen very fast.</span> <span data-start="474.53" data-end="476.61">Unfortunately, the prefetched websites</span> <span data-start="476.61" data-end="479.7">can learn about the user's interest,</span> <span data-start="479.7" data-end="484.26">even if they don't visit the website.</span> <span data-start="484.26" data-end="487.68">One way to fix this would be for the referral site</span> <span data-start="487.68" data-end="490.16">to add a cache here.</span> <span data-start="490.16" data-end="493.17">Then the referral site could bootstrap the [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span data-start="493.17" data-end="496.1">in a privacy-preserving manner, because it</span> <span data-start="496.1" data-end="500.64">could let the browser prefetch your content from this cache.</span> <span data-start="500.64" data-end="503.84">This fixed the privacy concern and the content loads</span> <span data-start="503.84" data-end="504.75">instantly.</span> <span data-start="504.75" data-end="509.19">So is this the holy grail?</span> <span data-start="509.19" data-end="510.39">No, not yet.</span> <span data-start="510.39" data-end="512.309">As already explained, this design</span> <span data-start="512.309" data-end="515.73">ends up in full display in the product.</span> <span data-start="515.73" data-end="517.62">The browser's address bar shows the URL</span> <span data-start="517.62" data-end="521.669">of the referral site instead of the UI's because this</span> <span data-start="521.669" data-end="525.04">is where the browser thinks the content is coming from.</span> <span data-start="525.04" data-end="528.45">This is confusing to the users.</span> <span data-start="528.45" data-end="530.46">The issue is that the web platform</span> <span data-start="530.46" data-end="534.48">doesn't provide a proper way to let others bootstrap your page</span> <span data-start="534.48" data-end="535.47">loads.</span> <span data-start="535.47" data-end="538.02">But what if your render critical resources</span> <span data-start="538.02" data-end="541.53">could be shared with popular traffic sources,</span> <span data-start="541.53" data-end="544.39">and [INAUDIBLE] on your behalf.</span> <span data-start="544.39" data-end="546.99">This would let traffic source bootstrap [INAUDIBLE]..</span> <span data-start="546.99" data-end="548.77">And when the user navigates, it's</span> <span data-start="548.77" data-end="554.29">just a regular page load from your servers, only much faster.</span> <span data-start="554.29" data-end="556.44">So how can we achieve this?</span> <span data-start="556.44" data-end="559.08">The browser needs a way to verify</span> <span data-start="559.08" data-end="560.9">the true origin of resources that</span> <span data-start="560.9" data-end="563.13">are served by a fast cache.</span> <span data-start="563.13" data-end="566.61">This can be done by adding a proof of origin</span> <span data-start="566.61" data-end="569.1">on these resources, which is exactly</span> <span data-start="569.1" data-end="571.12">what web packaging provides.</span> <span data-start="571.12" data-end="574.38">So let's see the actual standard proposals.</span> <span data-start="574.38" data-end="577.71">Web packaging is not the name of a single proposal,</span> <span data-start="577.71" data-end="581.37">but an umbrella concept for multiple spec proposals.</span> <span data-start="581.37" data-end="583.86">The most important one is Signed Exchange.</span> <span data-start="583.86" data-end="587.04">It's basically a format that represents a single HTTP</span> <span data-start="587.04" data-end="590.76">exchange, or a pair with HTTP request/response.</span> <span data-start="590.76" data-end="593.43">Very simple, except that it's digitally</span> <span data-start="593.43" data-end="598.14">signed so that the browser can verify the origin of resource.</span> <span data-start="598.14" data-end="599.76">There's another proposal building</span> <span data-start="599.76" data-end="602.91">on top of Signed Exchange called the Bundled Exchange.</span> <span data-start="602.91" data-end="604.86">This is a bundle of exchanges.</span> <span data-start="604.86" data-end="607.47">Therefore it can represent multiple resources</span> <span data-start="607.47" data-end="610.38">in one package, like a whole web page.</span> <span data-start="610.38" data-end="612.03">We think that the Bundled Exchange</span> <span data-start="612.03" data-end="614.93">will enable other interesting use cases,</span> <span data-start="614.93" data-end="617.07">while we start to do the Signed Exchange,</span> <span data-start="617.07" data-end="619.44">since that's the key building block.</span> <span data-start="619.44" data-end="623.49">And after a year of work, we are pleased to announce</span> <span data-start="623.49" data-end="625.48">that we are starting an on-prem experiment</span> <span data-start="625.48" data-end="629.73">of the feature on Chrome 71, which is in beta now.</span> <span data-start="629.73" data-end="632.82">You can play locally with it by enabling a flag,</span> <span data-start="632.82" data-end="636.63">or can join the experiment to enable it on your site.</span> <span data-start="636.63" data-end="643.11">Please visit bit.ly/try-sxg to find out how.</span> <span data-start="643.11" data-end="645.3">We'd love to get your feedback on this.</span> <span data-start="645.3" data-end="650.07">That will help us improve this feature more quickly.</span> <span data-start="650.07" data-end="653.38">So in order to create published Signed Exchanges</span> <span data-start="653.38" data-end="656.2">for your resources, you need to first acquire</span> <span data-start="656.2" data-end="660.46">a certificate that can sign exchanges and host it</span> <span data-start="660.46" data-end="661.78">at a public URL.</span> <span data-start="661.78" data-end="665.44">Such a certificate can be created at DigiCert today.</span> <span data-start="665.44" data-end="667.06">Once you do that, you can generate</span> <span data-start="667.06" data-end="669.37">Signed Exchanges for your resources</span> <span data-start="669.37" data-end="671.47">by using an open-source tool.</span> <span data-start="671.47" data-end="673.6">This process is very manual.</span> <span data-start="673.6" data-end="677.189">But we'll talk about the options later in this talk.</span> </section>

much the same as an iframe,</span> <span data-start="1167.39" data-end="1172.19">and then navigate to an element by calling an activate API.</span> <span data-start="1172.19" data-end="1174.62">When that API is called, the element</span> <span data-start="1174.62" data-end="1179">is detached from the page and becomes the new top-level page.</span> <span data-start="1179" data-end="1184.67">You can also add an animation to smooth out the transition.</span> <span data-start="1184.67" data-end="1187.57">So what are the differences between portals and iframes?</span> <span data-start="1187.57" data-end="1192.83">The biggest difference is that portals can be navigated into.</span> <span data-start="1192.83" data-end="1194.62">And as I understand the differences,</span> <span data-start="1194.62" data-end="1198.224">the portals are always created as top-level browsing context,</span> <span data-start="1198.224" data-end="1199.682">whereas as it can still be embedded</span> <span data-start="1199.682" data-end="1202.3">in a page like iframes.</span> <span data-start="1202.3" data-end="1203.62">Let's recap the benefits.</span> <span data-start="1203.62" data-end="1206.53">Portals enable seamless page transitions,</span> <span data-start="1206.53" data-end="1208.93">like what you get with single page apps,</span> <span data-start="1208.93" data-end="1211.63">but without having to re-architect your site,</span> <span data-start="1211.63" data-end="1214.64">and even across different origins.</span> <span data-start="1214.64" data-end="1217.42">So you can just build you website using multiple pages,</span> <span data-start="1217.42" data-end="1220.86">and can connect them with portals.</span> <span data-start="1220.86" data-end="1223.81">So here's the example of code snippet of portals.</span> <span data-start="1223.81" data-end="1227.08">You can create a portal as an HTML element,</span> <span data-start="1227.08" data-end="1230.5">and then can append it to the page to help it embed.</span> <span data-start="1230.5" data-end="1233.32">Then when the user touches the embedded portal,</span> <span data-start="1233.32" data-end="1235.48">you can show a nice animation.</span> <span data-start="1235.48" data-end="1239.73">And the calls activate the API to make the actual transition.</span> <span data-start="1239.73" data-end="1242.29">That's it.</span> <span data-start="1242.29" data-end="1243.49">Exciting, isn't it?</span> <span data-start="1246.5" data-end="1248.96">And you probably want to know the current status.</span> <span data-start="1248.96" data-end="1250.77">We have an explainer on GitHub.</span> <span data-start="1250.77" data-end="1255.31">Visit bit.ly/portals-spec to learn more.</span> <span data-start="1255.31" data-end="1257.59">Chrome implementation is in progress.</span> <span data-start="1257.59" data-end="1259.93">We are aiming for an origin trial next year,</span> <span data-start="1259.93" data-end="1262.9">and are eagerly awaiting your feedback that will</span> <span data-start="1262.9" data-end="1265.96">help us refine this proposal.</span> <span data-start="1265.96" data-end="1268.54">So that's basically all from us about low friction</span> <span data-start="1268.54" data-end="1269.38">to zero friction.</span> <span data-start="1269.38" data-end="1272.94">But I have one more topic, Bundled Exchanges.</span> <span data-start="1272.94" data-end="1277.02">So remember that we hinted at Bundled Exchanges earlier?</span> <span data-start="1277.02" data-end="1280.87">They allow multiple resources to be bundled in one package.</span> <span data-start="1280.87" data-end="1284.05">And you might be wondering about the kind</span> <span data-start="1284.05" data-end="1286.26">of status of the development.</span> <span data-start="1286.26" data-end="1290.08">So while the Chrome team has started building a prototype</span> <span data-start="1290.08" data-end="1292.88">to explore the possibilities, we think</span> <span data-start="1292.88" data-end="1295.48">this could enable interesting use case</span> <span data-start="1295.48" data-end="1299.53">scenarios, like offering PWA installation, and much more.</span> <span data-start="1299.53" data-end="1302.74">Here's an example up at News-Reader PWA.</span> <span data-start="1302.74" data-end="1305.05">This is based on [INAUDIBLE] read up</span> <span data-start="1305.05" data-end="1308.18">built by one of our awesome [INAUDIBLE] folks,</span> <span data-start="1308.18" data-end="1311.87">and now runs on a custom Chrome build to use Bundled Exchanges.</span> <span data-start="1311.87" data-end="1316.79">The app allows the user to read a news site in a reliable way</span> <span data-start="1316.79" data-end="1318.72">by letting [INAUDIBLE] circle download</span> <span data-start="1318.72" data-end="1321.49">and save the articles as bundles,</span> <span data-start="1321.49" data-end="1324.82">if the news site provides them, so that the user can later</span> <span data-start="1324.82" data-end="1327.73">read the saved articles from multiple sites,</span> <span data-start="1327.73" data-end="1329.62">even while offline.</span> <span data-start="1329.62" data-end="1331.12">Notice that the articles are still</span> <span data-start="1331.12" data-end="1333.58">shown as coming from the original news sites.</span> <span data-start="1333.58" data-end="1337.28">And the sites keep maintaining the control over them.</span> <span data-start="1337.28" data-end="1339.13">Here's another example.</span> <span data-start="1339.13" data-end="1343.09">As you may know, loading a large number of resources is costly.</span> <span data-start="1343.09" data-end="1345.71">In the bundling of them, in one big JavaScript file</span> <span data-start="1345.71" data-end="1349.93">using bundles like webpack is a very popular technique.</span> <span data-start="1349.93" data-end="1353.05">We did an experiment to see if Bundled Exchanges can</span> <span data-start="1353.05" data-end="1356.08">be used there, which could allow the browser</span> <span data-start="1356.08" data-end="1359.17">to process in the cache individual resources</span> <span data-start="1359.17" data-end="1362.83">in the bundle, without executing the JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="1362.83" data-end="1365.29">And one of our results looked like this.</span> <span data-start="1365.29" data-end="1368.88">While still preliminary, it looks promising, we think.</span> <span data-start="1368.88" data-end="1370.782">So we think there's some potential</span> <span data-start="1370.782" data-end="1372.115">and want to know what you think.</span> </section>
