<p><span data-start="49.75" data-end="52.63"><span class="speaker">Adam Argyle</span>: And notice that we have a little bar chart there.</span> <span data-start="52.63" data-end="55.25">Under there, tells you the amount of support that we have.</span> <span data-start="55.25" data-end="57.22">And we're going to start with things that have great support</span> <span data-start="57.22" data-end="58.637">and by the end we're going to find</span> <span data-start="58.637" data-end="60.22">things that have no support.</span> <span data-start="60.22" data-end="61.09">So, aw scroll-snap.</span> <span data-start="61.09" data-end="64.01">One of my favorite things here is that the support is great.</span> <span data-start="64.01" data-end="66.79">It's touch-enabled, 60 frames per second, native scrolling</span> <span data-start="66.79" data-end="68.14">for every platform.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="68.14" data-end="71.17">There's no synthetic scrolling with scroll snap points.</span> <span data-start="71.17" data-end="72.802">And it's all organic.</span> <span data-start="72.802" data-end="73.51">It's not organic.</span> <span data-start="73.51" data-end="75.91">Anyway, whatever, it's mobile and desktop for free.</span> <span data-start="75.91" data-end="77.62">And my pro tip with aw scroll-snap</span> <span data-start="77.62" data-end="79.62">is make sure that you try to keep it horizontal,</span> <span data-start="79.62" data-end="80.995">because when you do it vertically</span> <span data-start="80.995" data-end="82.78">it kind of feels like scroll hijacking.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="82.78" data-end="84.31">So let's look at a little diagram.</span> <span data-start="84.31" data-end="86.23">We've got —  our viewport is in the center.</span> <span data-start="86.23" data-end="88.51">Each dot represents a snap point item.</span> <span data-start="88.51" data-end="90.95">And this is basically a carousel where the items</span> <span data-start="90.95" data-end="92.21">snap to the inline start.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="92.21" data-end="92.98">And let's see.</span> <span data-start="92.98" data-end="95.59">Let's a demo because we love animations.</span> <span data-start="95.59" data-end="98.33">So we have a horizontal snap point demo here.</span> <span data-start="98.33" data-end="99.52">This feels like a carousel.</span> <span data-start="99.52" data-end="102.82">We're looking at shirts by Ten Hun, a rad Seattle artist.</span> <span data-start="102.82" data-end="105.16">And we have a scroll x, so we have overflow container</span> <span data-start="105.16" data-end="106.33">on the section.</span> <span data-start="106.33" data-end="108.13">We're snap starting, we're throwing,</span> <span data-start="108.13" data-end="109.455">and we're allowing skipping.</span> <span data-start="109.455" data-end="110.83">So scroll snap stop, you can tell</span> <span data-start="110.83" data-end="112.45">it to stop at one at a time, in case</span> <span data-start="112.45" data-end="113.95">you don't want to let them throw.</span> <span data-start="113.95" data-end="116.02">And it always settles perfectly.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="116.02" data-end="116.86">So got to love that.</span> <span data-start="116.86" data-end="118.15">And did you know — </span> <span data-start="118.15" data-end="119.75">well, I'm sure you did 'cause I mentioned it earlier — </span> <span data-start="119.75" data-end="120.68">you can do it vertically.</span> <span data-start="120.68" data-end="121.888">So here I'm doing vertically.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="121.888" data-end="125.02">Same CSS, I've pretty much just flipped the x for a y.</span> <span data-start="125.02" data-end="127.33">And I've told it to align center because that just</span> <span data-start="127.33" data-end="128.18">looks so good.</span> <span data-start="128.18" data-end="128.94">Mm.</span> <span data-start="128.94" data-end="129.44">I like it.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="177.19" data-end="179.06">We see this pattern a lot.</span> <span data-start="179.06" data-end="183.185">And if we want that submenu here to appear, or be displayed,</span> <span data-start="183.185" data-end="184.81">when you hover over its parent element,</span> <span data-start="184.81" data-end="187.24">we can apply some CSS to style it.</span> <span data-start="187.24" data-end="189.895">So it could look like this, where on hover or on focus</span> <span data-start="189.895" data-end="192.27">to that element —  because you always want to have a focus</span> <span data-start="192.27" data-end="194.38">style when you are creating hover styles — </span> <span data-start="194.38" data-end="197.2">we want to make sure that inside list becomes visible</span> <span data-start="197.2" data-end="199.69">and it has a display.</span> <span data-start="199.69" data-end="201.28">In theory, we could then write code</span> <span data-start="201.28" data-end="202.72">like this, where we say visability</span> <span data-start="202.72" data-end="205.31">visible, with opacity one, display block.</span> <span data-start="205.31" data-end="207.26">But as we're tabbing through here,</span> <span data-start="207.26" data-end="210.037">we're actually not able to see the elements</span> <span data-start="210.037" data-end="211.87">inside of that second list item, which we've</span> <span data-start="211.87" data-end="214.48">applied to that sublist within.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="214.48" data-end="216.31">And that's because we're using focus.</span> <span data-start="216.31" data-end="217.893">When you style with focus, when you're</span> <span data-start="217.893" data-end="220.72">tabbing into the parent using that focus style,</span> <span data-start="220.72" data-end="223.24">you will have those children visibly appear.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="223.24" data-end="226">But when you tab to the next tabbable element,</span> <span data-start="226" data-end="229.6">they disappear because we're no longer focusing on the parent.</span> <span data-start="229.6" data-end="232.01">So you lose that style.</span> <span data-start="232.01" data-end="234.558">Now if you use focus-within, it solves those problems</span> <span data-start="234.558" data-end="236.35">because you're actually telling the browser</span> <span data-start="236.35" data-end="238.93">to apply that style when you're focusing within a parent</span> <span data-start="238.93" data-end="240.05">element.</span> <span data-start="240.05" data-end="241.48">So that could look like this.</span> <span data-start="241.48" data-end="244.15">All we have to do is swap focus to focus-within,</span> <span data-start="244.15" data-end="245.89">and when we tab through these — </span> <span data-start="245.89" data-end="248.11">over here you see that sub-navigation appear</span> <span data-start="248.11" data-end="251.46">and we've solved that accessibility problem.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="303.75" data-end="305.67">Support's killer and have a fun demo that I</span> <span data-start="305.67" data-end="306.9">want to show you real quick.</span> <span data-start="306.9" data-end="309.81">So we have an animation that's pretty wobbly.</span> <span data-start="309.81" data-end="311.5">We have mixing of colors happening.</span> <span data-start="311.5" data-end="314.43">But if the user prefers reduced, instead of removing</span> <span data-start="314.43" data-end="315.692">the animation, I cross-fade.</span> <span data-start="315.692" data-end="318.15">This is an important thing I want to share with y'all, that</span> <span data-start="318.15" data-end="320.99">reduced motion does not mean no motion.</span> <span data-start="320.99" data-end="324.17">Anyway, just I thought that was a cool demo.</span> <span data-start="324.17" data-end="325.835">I got really worked up there.</span> <span data-start="325.835" data-end="328.21">DevTools has got your back in case you wanted to test it.</span> <span data-start="328.21" data-end="330.07">So just pop it open, go to the rendering tab — </span> <span data-start="330.07" data-end="331.05">which you can get there from the, like,</span> <span data-start="331.05" data-end="333.09">snowman that's on the left of console there — </span> <span data-start="333.09" data-end="335.46">and you can change the properties and test your work.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="335.46" data-end="336.443">It's super cool.</span> <span data-start="336.443" data-end="337.86">Another one that's pretty popular,</span> <span data-start="337.86" data-end="340.318">which you might have noticed on the Chrome Dev Summit site,</span> <span data-start="340.318" data-end="342.57">is prefers-color-scheme light or dark.</span> <span data-start="342.57" data-end="345.51">So you can adapt your UI for your user's preference</span> <span data-start="345.51" data-end="346.32">on their eyes.</span> <span data-start="346.32" data-end="347.55">It's really hot right now.</span> <span data-start="347.55" data-end="348.96">My mom is on dark mode.</span> <span data-start="348.96" data-end="350.13">Hi, mom.</span> <span data-start="350.13" data-end="351.845">You're in my talk now.</span> <span data-start="351.845" data-end="352.47">And here it is.</span> <span data-start="352.47" data-end="354.4">Again, we have a little bit of code here.</span> <span data-start="354.4" data-end="355.96">We have a little demo.</span> <span data-start="355.96" data-end="358.23">CSS —  our CDS site is a good example of this.</span> <span data-start="358.23" data-end="360.78">And I have a hot tip, which is to follow</span> <span data-start="360.78" data-end="363.475">some of the HSL patterns that we've seen with Una's demos.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="363.475" data-end="365.85">So we'll have a CodePen demo in that link that we shared.</span> <span data-start="365.85" data-end="368.78">And there you can just sort of flip a couple custom properties</span> <span data-start="368.78" data-end="370.8">and watch the whole site pretty much invert.</span> <span data-start="370.8" data-end="371.67">Super rad.</span> <span data-start="371.67" data-end="373.775">And again, DevTools has got your back.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="526.85" data-end="529.19">Without logical properties, as you change the direction</span> <span data-start="529.19" data-end="532.09">and writing mode, the layout integrity falls apart.</span> <span data-start="532.09" data-end="533.45">Our boxes collapse.</span> <span data-start="533.45" data-end="535.91">That border top becomes misplaced.</span> <span data-start="535.91" data-end="537.53">The text is overlapping.</span> <span data-start="537.53" data-end="539.93">And it starts to look a little bit like a mess.</span> <span data-start="539.93" data-end="542.51">But with logical properties, we can have the browser</span> <span data-start="542.51" data-end="544.315">do that work for us.</span> <span data-start="544.315" data-end="546.44">When we're using logical properties in this layout,</span> <span data-start="546.44" data-end="548.63">instead of using height we've used block-size,</span> <span data-start="548.63" data-end="551.12">and instead of using width, we've used inline-size.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="551.12" data-end="553.76">And this allows for the boxes to not collapse when we're</span> <span data-start="553.76" data-end="557.125">creating a vertical layout.</span> <span data-start="557.125" data-end="558.5">Instead of the margin-left, we're</span> <span data-start="558.5" data-end="561.17">using a margin-inline-start here on those headers</span> <span data-start="561.17" data-end="561.95">and paragraphs.</span> <span data-start="561.95" data-end="564.2">So as we swap directions, we still</span> <span data-start="564.2" data-end="568.31">have the style of that layout maintained.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="568.31" data-end="571.92">And finally, in this main section here, for the border,</span> <span data-start="571.92" data-end="574.7">we are using border-block-start and margin-block-start instead</span> <span data-start="574.7" data-end="576.74">of a border-top and margin-top.</span> <span data-start="576.74" data-end="582.055">And that's what's making that border retain its spacing.</span> <span data-start="582.055" data-end="586.61">So you can write code like this or you can write code</span> <span data-start="586.61" data-end="588.26">like this.</span> <span data-start="588.26" data-end="590.63">And it's the same amount of code, same number of lines.</span> <span data-start="590.63" data-end="593.035">It's just changing the mental model of how you write it.</span> <span data-start="593.035" data-end="595.16">And the browser does all of that great work for you</span> <span data-start="595.16" data-end="599.7">to make that website more internationalized.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1046.569" data-end="1048.486">Whether you're trying to animate that gradient</span> <span data-start="1048.486" data-end="1051.28">inside the gradient itself or using this custom property here</span> <span data-start="1051.28" data-end="1055.51">to try to do it, the browser can't comprehend what</span> <span data-start="1055.51" data-end="1057.7">you're trying to tell it to do.</span> <span data-start="1057.7" data-end="1059.59">In this example I'm trying to animate</span> <span data-start="1059.59" data-end="1062.83">from a red to pink, to a blue to pink gradient on hover,</span> <span data-start="1062.83" data-end="1064.6">with a one second smooth transition.</span> <span data-start="1064.6" data-end="1066.85">But the browser has trouble interpolating these values</span> <span data-start="1066.85" data-end="1068.69">in this context.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1068.69" data-end="1070.78">Now, if we register a custom property</span> <span data-start="1070.78" data-end="1073.225">and call it gradientStart, we can set a syntax</span> <span data-start="1073.225" data-end="1076.1">to that property so that the browser knows what to expect.</span> <span data-start="1076.1" data-end="1078.92">So here we're setting a syntax of color.</span> <span data-start="1078.92" data-end="1081.97">And there is the exact same code that we saw before,</span> <span data-start="1081.97" data-end="1084.55">but we are seeing that smooth one second transition</span> <span data-start="1084.55" data-end="1086.98">because we've now told the browser that gradientStart</span> <span data-start="1086.98" data-end="1088.66">is a color and to look out for that.</span> <span data-start="1088.66" data-end="1093.06">And it knows how to interpolate now between those color values.</span> <span data-start="1093.06" data-end="1095.43">Custom properties are great for design systems.</span> <span data-start="1095.43" data-end="1097.83">They're great for type checking your CSS.</span> <span data-start="1097.83" data-end="1100.32">In this example, we have a custom property</span> <span data-start="1100.32" data-end="1102.09">called colorPrimary that we've given</span> <span data-start="1102.09" data-end="1104.63">an initial value of deep pink.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1104.63" data-end="1106.8">When we have some code here, I don't necessarily</span> <span data-start="1106.8" data-end="1109.26">have to say what colorPrimary is.</span> <span data-start="1109.26" data-end="1111.96">I don't have to specify it in either the global</span> <span data-start="1111.96" data-end="1113.52">or in the element level.</span> <span data-start="1113.52" data-end="1115.02">It just knows to read from deep pink</span> <span data-start="1115.02" data-end="1118.41">because we've registered it on the CSS interface.</span> <span data-start="1118.41" data-end="1121.155">We can still override that value very easily using the cascades.</span> <span data-start="1121.155" data-end="1123.91">So here I'm overriding colorPrimary as blue.</span> <span data-start="1123.91" data-end="1127.42">But if we have something that's invalid like a number here,</span> <span data-start="1127.42" data-end="1129.45">this will fall back to deep pink.</span> <span data-start="1129.45" data-end="1131.4">Without a registered custom property,</span> <span data-start="1131.4" data-end="1133.41">the CSS would just ignore that line</span> <span data-start="1133.41" data-end="1135.34">and it would appear like a blank box.</span> <span data-start="1135.34" data-end="1137.22">We would just see white background.</span> <span data-start="1137.22" data-end="1139.8">So having this really allows for type checking in CSS which</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1139.8" data-end="1142.26">I think is really cool.</span> <span data-start="1142.26" data-end="1144.3">Also, I think this is even more exciting.</span> <span data-start="1144.3" data-end="1147.427">The future syntax for this is all going to be in CSS.</span> <span data-start="1147.427" data-end="1149.76">So just like you can write custom properties in the root</span> <span data-start="1149.76" data-end="1152.52">now, you can write all of your property declarations</span> <span data-start="1152.52" data-end="1154.83">in your CSS, and keep them all in the same file,</span> <span data-start="1154.83" data-end="1156.082">and it's going to be great.</span> <span data-start="1156.082" data-end="1158.04">It's just this vision of the future that I see.</span> <span data-start="1158.04" data-end="1159.53">[SNIFFS]</span> <span data-start="1159.53" data-end="1160.16">Tear.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1280.4" data-end="1283.46">They're similar to Web Workers like Service Workers.</span> <span data-start="1283.46" data-end="1285.35">They're registered to your page and they</span> <span data-start="1285.35" data-end="1286.91">contain all the instructions that</span> <span data-start="1286.91" data-end="1291.8">live outside the main thread and can be acted upon when called.</span> <span data-start="1291.8" data-end="1294.65">So Houdini worklets work in very much the same way.</span> <span data-start="1294.65" data-end="1297.09">To get a Houdini worklet into your codebase,</span> <span data-start="1297.09" data-end="1298.092">you do the following.</span> <span data-start="1298.092" data-end="1300.05">You first would write and register your worklet</span> <span data-start="1300.05" data-end="1301.61">definition in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="1301.61" data-end="1303.89">So here, because I'm showcasing a paint worklet,</span> <span data-start="1303.89" data-end="1306.05">I would say register paint, give it a name,</span> <span data-start="1306.05" data-end="1309.68">and then have all the paint code being pulled inside there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1309.68" data-end="1311.72">Then we want to invoke that worklet file</span> <span data-start="1311.72" data-end="1314.51">by using Add Module on the CSS interface inside</span> <span data-start="1314.51" data-end="1315.74">of, say, the HTML here.</span> <span data-start="1315.74" data-end="1318.8">So we have script, CSS dot paintWorklet dot addModule,</span> <span data-start="1318.8" data-end="1320.09">and the name that we gave it.</span> <span data-start="1320.09" data-end="1322.6">And then finally we can use that worklet by that name — </span> <span data-start="1322.6" data-end="1324.85">so I call it "fun" here —  we can say background paint,</span> <span data-start="1324.85" data-end="1326.96">the type of worklet that we're pulling in here,</span> <span data-start="1326.96" data-end="1328.82">and then the name.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1468.02" data-end="1470.68">So I used a mix of custom properties and input arguments</span> <span data-start="1470.68" data-end="1472.41">for this.</span> <span data-start="1472.41" data-end="1473.59">Here is that worklet itself.</span> <span data-start="1473.59" data-end="1475.59">So I'm registering the paint, giving it a name — </span> <span data-start="1475.59" data-end="1477.31">angled-corners —  and then I'm pulling</span> <span data-start="1477.31" data-end="1479.512">in these input properties, these custom properties.</span> <span data-start="1479.512" data-end="1480.97">I'm telling the worklet to look out</span> <span data-start="1480.97" data-end="1483.43">for values that I'm going to then use inside the worklet</span> <span data-start="1483.43" data-end="1484.64">itself.</span> <span data-start="1484.64" data-end="1487.61">You can also pass custom input arguments.</span> <span data-start="1487.61" data-end="1489.67">So here I'm doing static get inputArguments</span> <span data-start="1489.67" data-end="1492.28">and I'm setting the syntax for these inputArguments.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1492.28" data-end="1495.23">In this case, the syntax is a custom identifier.</span> <span data-start="1495.23" data-end="1497.53">And so here I'm looking for that custom identifier</span> <span data-start="1497.53" data-end="1498.52">to be a string.</span> <span data-start="1498.52" data-end="1500.98">Fields are outlined to show two different modes</span> <span data-start="1500.98" data-end="1503.53">of using this worklet.</span> <span data-start="1503.53" data-end="1506.56">Then I can use the context, the size, the properties,</span> <span data-start="1506.56" data-end="1509.15">and arguments to build out this worklet.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1509.15" data-end="1512.02">And so what I'm doing here is I'm building this canvas angled</span> <span data-start="1512.02" data-end="1512.89">shape.</span> <span data-start="1512.89" data-end="1514.72">And I'm getting the properties, the size,</span> <span data-start="1514.72" data-end="1516.22">and using that to actually determine</span> <span data-start="1516.22" data-end="1517.97">where I'm placing those points.</span> <span data-start="1517.97" data-end="1521.38">And finally, here I'm calling for the argument of outlined.</span> <span data-start="1521.38" data-end="1523.15">I'm checking for that string.</span> <span data-start="1523.15" data-end="1524.86">If it's an outlined mode, then I'm</span> <span data-start="1524.86" data-end="1527.5">going to use a stroke to apply the style.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1544.72" data-end="1547.39">There's other types of buttons material and one of those</span> <span data-start="1547.39" data-end="1548.89">is the outlined button.</span> <span data-start="1548.89" data-end="1551.44">So here I'm using the outlined argument.</span> <span data-start="1551.44" data-end="1553.18">I'm setting a couple of more properties</span> <span data-start="1553.18" data-end="1555.19">here, the paint-color and the stroke-weight,</span> <span data-start="1555.19" data-end="1557.11">and I'm using the exact same worklet</span> <span data-start="1557.11" data-end="1561.17">to apply a border image that's then painting this on top.</span> <span data-start="1561.17" data-end="1563.92">So for the outlined button, I'm using a mask and a border image</span> <span data-start="1563.92" data-end="1566.1">with the same worklet.</span> <span data-start="1566.1" data-end="1568.38">So all together it looks like this.</span> <span data-start="1568.38" data-end="1571.29">You can also use these as CDNs.</span> <span data-start="1571.29" data-end="1574.56">So you could include this as a CDN in your file,</span> <span data-start="1574.56" data-end="1576.573">and then set your custom properties</span> <span data-start="1576.573" data-end="1577.99">and include that line of code that</span> <span data-start="1577.99" data-end="1579.39">says I want angled corners.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1655.93" data-end="1657.73">So, really quick, just like a paint worklet</span> <span data-start="1657.73" data-end="1659.49">we create a class which implements the Houdini</span> <span data-start="1659.49" data-end="1661.615">animation interface, which really just means it has</span> <span data-start="1661.615" data-end="1662.89">a function called animation.</span> <span data-start="1662.89" data-end="1666.383">Then we add the module to the CSS Object Model.</span> <span data-start="1666.383" data-end="1667.8">And since ours is an animation, we</span> <span data-start="1667.8" data-end="1670.393">don't really do much in the CSS after that point.</span> <span data-start="1670.393" data-end="1673.06">So let's see a demo just to show kind of what I'm talking about.</span> <span data-start="1673.06" data-end="1675.57">I built a tabs component, which might not be that exciting,</span> <span data-start="1675.57" data-end="1678">but notice our little indicator on the bottom.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1678" data-end="1680.16">It's always in sync with the scroll zone.</span> <span data-start="1680.16" data-end="1682.15">I can click to go to my different tabs.</span> <span data-start="1682.15" data-end="1685.38">I can use tab and space bar to navigate with accessibility.</span> <span data-start="1685.38" data-end="1687.84">And whether it's on a responsive desktop or on mobile,</span> <span data-start="1687.84" data-end="1688.5">I have touch.</span> <span data-start="1688.5" data-end="1689.61">I have everything.</span> <span data-start="1689.61" data-end="1692.14">And this is really exciting to me.</span> <span data-start="1692.14" data-end="1693.585">So how did I get there?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1693.585" data-end="1695.97">What this is, this is, Houdini plus a scroll timeline.</span> <span data-start="1695.97" data-end="1699.703">And so we can pass a new tick to Houdini.</span> <span data-start="1699.703" data-end="1701.37">And what that means is usually your tick</span> <span data-start="1701.37" data-end="1702.85">is usually the screen refresh rate,</span> <span data-start="1702.85" data-end="1705.4">but now we can send it to scroll position if something else.</span> <span data-start="1705.4" data-end="1708.48">So since I created a CSS grid layout</span> <span data-start="1708.48" data-end="1711.54">that had scrolling snap points, I create a keyframe effect.</span> <span data-start="1711.54" data-end="1714.495">I create a scroll timeline that points to that scrolling space,</span> <span data-start="1714.495" data-end="1716.37">and I pass in some options for initial state,</span> <span data-start="1716.37" data-end="1718.828">like how many tabs there are and what's the maximum scroll.</span> <span data-start="1718.828" data-end="1720.63">And I give that to the Animation Worklet</span> <span data-start="1720.63" data-end="1723.9">and then we get a gorgeous 60 frames per second scrolling</span> <span data-start="1723.9" data-end="1726.147">and in sync tab component.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1726.147" data-end="1727.98">So here's what a keyframe effect looks like.</span> <span data-start="1727.98" data-end="1729.36">The keyframe effect is kind of like</span> <span data-start="1729.36" data-end="1730.89">if you make the at keyframes animation</span> <span data-start="1730.89" data-end="1732.72">but you only take one little piece out of it.</span> <span data-start="1732.72" data-end="1734.345">You can kind of make many little pieces</span> <span data-start="1734.345" data-end="1735.57">and then assemble them later.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1735.57" data-end="1736.69">It's really cool.</span> <span data-start="1736.69" data-end="1738.9">If you haven't heard of a keyframe effect.</span> <span data-start="1738.9" data-end="1740.4">The scroll timeline is also cool.</span> <span data-start="1740.4" data-end="1741.18">So this is new.</span> <span data-start="1741.18" data-end="1743.07">This is where I'm creating a scroll timeline,</span> <span data-start="1743.07" data-end="1744.41">and notice with scroll there's going</span> <span data-start="1744.41" data-end="1746.05">to be other timelines in the future.</span> <span data-start="1746.05" data-end="1746.88">So what we're going to be able to do</span> <span data-start="1746.88" data-end="1748.62">is not just rely on one type of tick.</span> <span data-start="1748.62" data-end="1751.2">We can specify many and create our animations</span> <span data-start="1751.2" data-end="1753.038">that are like reactive to different things.</span> <span data-start="1753.038" data-end="1755.58">So this one is reactive to the scroll source, which is called</span> <span data-start="1755.58" data-end="1758.23">section, and I give it a width.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1758.23" data-end="1760.59">I clamp the length there.</span> <span data-start="1760.59" data-end="1762.75">And I created a worklet called "tabs."</span> <span data-start="1762.75" data-end="1765.273">The constructor takes in some initial props and set state.</span> <span data-start="1765.273" data-end="1766.69">I have the animate function that's</span> <span data-start="1766.69" data-end="1767.91">going to get called on tick.</span> <span data-start="1767.91" data-end="1769.77">And it does the math which is going</span> <span data-start="1769.77" data-end="1771.72">to calculate the position.</span> <span data-start="1771.72" data-end="1774.61">All together now, this is my tab dot controller.</span> <span data-start="1774.61" data-end="1776.88">So I'm going to create a new animation that's</span> <span data-start="1776.88" data-end="1778.11">spinning up my worklet.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1778.11" data-end="1779.143">I'm going to name it — </span> <span data-start="1779.143" data-end="1780.81">well, I'm going to reference it by name.</span> <span data-start="1780.81" data-end="1782.173">My pass and my keyframe effect.</span> <span data-start="1782.173" data-end="1783.84">I'm going to pass on my scroll timeline.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1783.84" data-end="1786.34">There's my initial state that we were talking about earlier.</span> <span data-start="1786.34" data-end="1789.28">And then I say animation dot play, and nothing happens.</span> <span data-start="1789.28" data-end="1790.26">Why?</span> <span data-start="1790.26" data-end="1792.78">Because the tick is not the screen refresh rate,</span> <span data-start="1792.78" data-end="1794.19">it's my scroll position.</span> <span data-start="1794.19" data-end="1796.208">You have to scroll to make it go!</span> <span data-start="1796.208" data-end="1797.5">And I think that's really cool.</span> <span data-start="1797.5" data-end="1798.708">So we got everything in here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1798.708" data-end="1801.338">We have touch, we have mouse, we have keyboard.</span> <span data-start="1801.338" data-end="1802.38">Everything's ready to go.</span> <span data-start="1802.38" data-end="1803.49">This is on a [INAUDIBLE].</span> <span data-start="1803.49" data-end="1804.91">Fork it and check it out.</span> <span data-start="1804.91" data-end="1806.423">It's super rad.</span> <span data-start="1806.423" data-end="1808.59">And this is something that I got really inspired by.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1808.59" data-end="1810.825">Once I made that demo, my brain started going nuts</span> <span data-start="1810.825" data-end="1812.7">about the reactive animations I could create,</span> <span data-start="1812.7" data-end="1813.79">and I saw this GIF and I was like,</span> <span data-start="1813.79" data-end="1815.832">I could do that with Houdini and scroll timeline.</span> <span data-start="1815.832" data-end="1818.685">We've got a vertical scroll snap and a horizontal scroll snap.</span> <span data-start="1818.685" data-end="1821.31">And all we're doing is reacting to the position of those things</span> <span data-start="1821.31" data-end="1822.24">and we're letting them snap.</span> <span data-start="1822.24" data-end="1823.8">And we want people to be able to touch and push</span> <span data-start="1823.8" data-end="1825.28">those things any way that they want.</span> <span data-start="1825.28" data-end="1827.27">I'm starting to talk fast and that's because it's time for — </span> </p>
