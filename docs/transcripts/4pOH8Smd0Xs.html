<p><span data-start="4.885" data-end="6.76"><span class="speaker">Martin Splitt</span>: Good to be back on this stage.</span> <span data-start="6.76" data-end="9.25">And I hope that you all have some energy left</span> <span data-start="9.25" data-end="11.86">from two fantastic days of lots of content.</span> <span data-start="11.86" data-end="15.97">And content is what we're mostly going to be talking about as</span> <span data-start="15.97" data-end="19.18">well, because I would like to talk to you about what we have</span> <span data-start="19.18" data-end="22.99">done to bring your content out more in Google Search</span> <span data-start="22.99" data-end="25">and make it shine.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="25" data-end="25.69">Cool!</span> <span data-start="25.69" data-end="26.23">All right.</span> <span data-start="26.23" data-end="30.4">So I think one of the things that I</span> <span data-start="30.4" data-end="34.3">have learned over the last one and a half years-ish of talking</span> <span data-start="34.3" data-end="36.79">with you all and also bringing my perspective as a web</span> <span data-start="36.79" data-end="38.98">developer to the Google Search team</span> <span data-start="38.98" data-end="41.95">is that sometimes we underestimate</span> <span data-start="41.95" data-end="44.95">the power of Google Search and what it does to our website.</span> <span data-start="44.95" data-end="48.22">Because, fundamentally, why do we build websites?</span> <span data-start="48.22" data-end="51.133">I mean, sure, OK, we also build websites</span> <span data-start="51.133" data-end="53.05">because we are kind of excited about the stuff</span> <span data-start="53.05" data-end="55.72">that we can build, like any new capabilities and all that stuff</span> <span data-start="55.72" data-end="57.22">that we brought to the web platform.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="57.22" data-end="58.9">They're exciting.</span> <span data-start="58.9" data-end="61.84">But, fundamentally, we build our websites for users.</span> <span data-start="61.84" data-end="64.989">And all our work towards performance, and user</span> <span data-start="64.989" data-end="68.59">experience, and safety, and privacy, and all that</span> <span data-start="68.59" data-end="70.34">are basically mirroring that as well.</span> <span data-start="70.34" data-end="73.63">But, fundamentally, we want users to find our content</span> <span data-start="73.63" data-end="75.13">because the web apps that we create,</span> <span data-start="75.13" data-end="76.69">the content that we put on the web,</span> <span data-start="76.69" data-end="78.94">we think is very, very valuable.</span> <span data-start="78.94" data-end="81.89">Hopefully you think that your content is valuable.</span> <span data-start="81.89" data-end="84.67">If not, we should have a chat, I believe.</span> <span data-start="84.67" data-end="87.07">But, OK, let's assume that you think that your content is</span> <span data-start="87.07" data-end="89.65">really good, and you have done the necessary steps</span> <span data-start="89.65" data-end="91.09">to make it good.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="91.09" data-end="92.74">How much does Google Search give you?</span> <span data-start="92.74" data-end="93.94">How much does it help you?</span> <span data-start="93.94" data-end="96.19">Well, it turns out, by a recent study</span> <span data-start="96.19" data-end="101.2">that was done, that approximately 53%</span> <span data-start="101.2" data-end="105.22">of the traffic that websites are seeing</span> <span data-start="105.22" data-end="108.042">are actually coming through organic search.</span> <span data-start="108.042" data-end="109">What is organic search?</span> <span data-start="109" data-end="111.61">That's your day-to-day search engine</span> <span data-start="111.61" data-end="113.413">of choice, whatever it is.</span> <span data-start="113.413" data-end="115.08">That can be Google Search, for instance.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="115.08" data-end="117.19">So what we are doing is we are trying</span> <span data-start="117.19" data-end="121.69">to bring free traffic to you, to bring your content to the users</span> <span data-start="121.69" data-end="124.63">to make sure that your content can actually shine and prosper</span> <span data-start="124.63" data-end="127">on the web and that you, your company, your business</span> <span data-start="127" data-end="129.74">can actually be successful as well.</span> <span data-start="129.74" data-end="132.1">So that's one way to look at Search.</span> <span data-start="132.1" data-end="135.16">And I think, for us developers, it's an important venue</span> <span data-start="135.16" data-end="138.765">to understand where are the users coming from who we hope</span> <span data-start="138.765" data-end="140.14">to be on the site, and how can we</span> <span data-start="140.14" data-end="142.307">make sure that they are seeing the content that they</span> <span data-start="142.307" data-end="144.89">need to see, because it's our content after all.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="144.89" data-end="146.8">And today, I'd like to look back at what</span> <span data-start="146.8" data-end="151.32">we have done this year to make Google Search better for you.</span> <span data-start="151.32" data-end="153.07">So we are making things better without you</span> <span data-start="153.07" data-end="153.987">having to do the work.</span> <span data-start="153.987" data-end="154.8">Isn't that amazing?</span> <span data-start="154.8" data-end="156.58">It's like free, good stuff.</span> <span data-start="156.58" data-end="158.168">It's like a free cookie.</span> <span data-start="158.168" data-end="158.71">I don't know.</span> <span data-start="158.71" data-end="161.2">It's not as good as a cookie, though.</span> <span data-start="161.2" data-end="163.66">I still think, though, cookies, the entire thing</span> <span data-start="163.66" data-end="165.73">with baking cookies is a weird one anyway.</span> <span data-start="165.73" data-end="167.745">I think you have good cookie dough,</span> <span data-start="167.745" data-end="170.12">and then you put it in the oven and it comes out as good?</span> <span data-start="170.12" data-end="171.58">But no, anyway.</span> <span data-start="171.58" data-end="172.69">Might just be me.</span> <span data-start="172.69" data-end="176.62">So one of the biggest things that has happened in this year</span> <span data-start="176.62" data-end="179.02">is probably our announcement at Google I/O</span> <span data-start="179.02" data-end="181.28">that Googlebot is now evergreen.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="181.28" data-end="181.78">Right?</span> <span data-start="181.78" data-end="182.92">That's a quantum leap.</span> <span data-start="182.92" data-end="186.64">We have been using a crawler or a rendering engine that</span> <span data-start="186.64" data-end="189.37">was a little behind, and we have jumped forward</span> <span data-start="189.37" data-end="192.4">to making that evergreen, to keep up with Google Chrome</span> <span data-start="192.4" data-end="194.8">and actually give you all the features that Google brings</span> <span data-start="194.8" data-end="198.16">to the web platform, also in rendering so that we can index</span> <span data-start="198.16" data-end="200.77">the content that relies on these new technologies,</span> <span data-start="200.77" data-end="203.2">and possibilities, and capabilities of the web</span> <span data-start="203.2" data-end="204.08">platform.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="204.08" data-end="205.88">But what does that really mean?</span> <span data-start="205.88" data-end="207.91">Well, first things first.</span> <span data-start="207.91" data-end="210.67">This is a huge leap, and has been basically worked</span> <span data-start="210.67" data-end="212.77">on by many teams, many people.</span> <span data-start="212.77" data-end="215.44">A lot of the work is now also visible in other venues.</span> <span data-start="215.44" data-end="217.87">Puppeteer, for instance, is a side effect</span> <span data-start="217.87" data-end="220.24">from what we have done in Google Search as well.</span> <span data-start="220.24" data-end="222.91">And it brings over a thousand new features.</span> <span data-start="222.91" data-end="226.87">ES6, we have proper Web Component version 1 support.</span> <span data-start="226.87" data-end="228.88">We have —  well, no we don't have — </span> <span data-start="228.88" data-end="231.74">we have a bunch of new stuff that we didn't have before.</span> <span data-start="231.74" data-end="235.42">You can now rely on that to not be an SEO problem, to not</span> <span data-start="235.42" data-end="237.19">get in the way of your content actually</span> <span data-start="237.19" data-end="238.84">being accessible to Google Search</span> <span data-start="238.84" data-end="241.03">and actually being visible in Google Search.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="241.03" data-end="243.73">We have also made sure that we are not just</span> <span data-start="243.73" data-end="246.23">doing one update one time.</span> <span data-start="246.23" data-end="248.8">But within a relatively short timeframe</span> <span data-start="248.8" data-end="251.92">of every new stable release that comes to Chrome,</span> <span data-start="251.92" data-end="254.65">we are actually updating our Googlebot rendering engine</span> <span data-start="254.65" data-end="257.44">as well, so that what you see in your Chrome</span> <span data-start="257.44" data-end="260.22">is also what you see in Google Search.</span> <span data-start="260.22" data-end="261.333">And not just that.</span> <span data-start="261.333" data-end="262.75">We also made sure that the testing</span> <span data-start="262.75" data-end="263.95">tools we have out there — </span> <span data-start="263.95" data-end="265.9">the rich results test, the M-test,</span> <span data-start="265.9" data-end="268.75">the mobile-friendly test, the URL inspection tool within</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="268.75" data-end="269.68">Search Console — </span> <span data-start="269.68" data-end="272.95">all these tools, they are also up-to-date with whatever</span> <span data-start="272.95" data-end="274.54">version of Chrome we are using when</span> <span data-start="274.54" data-end="276.28">Googlebot renders your pages.</span> <span data-start="276.28" data-end="278.65">So you can actually verify that things</span> <span data-start="278.65" data-end="280.495">are working in Google Search.</span> <span data-start="283.31" data-end="285.47">The nice thing is that, with this new change,</span> <span data-start="285.47" data-end="290.69">we are all still catching up to what this means when Microsoft</span> <span data-start="290.69" data-end="293.33">announced that Edge is now using Chromium as well</span> <span data-start="293.33" data-end="294.9">as the rendering engine.</span> <span data-start="294.9" data-end="297.86">We were really, really excited to see that Bing has also went</span> <span data-start="297.86" data-end="299.63">forward and went like, OK, yes.</span> <span data-start="299.63" data-end="303.11">We are also running with an evergreen Bingbot,</span> <span data-start="303.11" data-end="306.56">and we want to render JavaScript using state-of-the-art</span> <span data-start="306.56" data-end="307.86">rendering as well.</span> <span data-start="307.86" data-end="311.09">So this means that now, across the industry in search engines,</span> <span data-start="311.09" data-end="312.95">we are seeing signals of actually getting up</span> <span data-start="312.95" data-end="316.43">to speed with the modern web in search engine indexing,</span> <span data-start="316.43" data-end="319.5">and that's really, really exciting to me.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="319.5" data-end="323.41">Also, basically, Google Search got a lot more powerful</span> <span data-start="323.41" data-end="326.26">because we are using the browser that you are probably</span> <span data-start="326.26" data-end="328.78">using as well when we are rendering your pages,</span> <span data-start="328.78" data-end="331.09">and making sure that we work and continue</span> <span data-start="331.09" data-end="334.06">to work on making sure that what we see when we index</span> <span data-start="334.06" data-end="336.31">your content to show it to users on Search</span> <span data-start="336.31" data-end="339.07">later, that we are seeing what you're seeing as well.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="339.07" data-end="340.3">Right?</span> <span data-start="340.3" data-end="345.95">But there is one thing where we still have some work to do.</span> <span data-start="345.95" data-end="347.66">This is the user agent that you see</span> <span data-start="347.66" data-end="350.99">in your server logs if we are accessing</span> <span data-start="350.99" data-end="353.93">your content with Googlebot.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="353.93" data-end="358.25">And the keen eye might spot that something's off here.</span> <span data-start="358.25" data-end="359.24">Right?</span> <span data-start="359.24" data-end="361.04">And I get asked this question, but you said</span> <span data-start="361.04" data-end="362.46">it's an evergreen Googlebot.</span> <span data-start="362.46" data-end="366.42">But then I look at my server logs and I see this.</span> <span data-start="366.42" data-end="367.62">What's happening here?</span> <span data-start="367.62" data-end="369.87">The simple answer to that is that we</span> <span data-start="369.87" data-end="374.7">are working to maximize the compatibility between Google</span> <span data-start="374.7" data-end="377.19">Search and websites, and we can't just</span> <span data-start="377.19" data-end="378.45">make changes like this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="378.45" data-end="380.55">We have to test things very carefully.</span> <span data-start="380.55" data-end="384">And we make sure that we are supporting everyone's content</span> <span data-start="384" data-end="385.08">in Google Search.</span> <span data-start="385.08" data-end="387.63">So we had to basically be very, very careful</span> <span data-start="387.63" data-end="389.91">moving forward with the user agent.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="389.91" data-end="392.07">But we have announced multiple times now</span> <span data-start="392.07" data-end="393.64">that this is about to change.</span> <span data-start="393.64" data-end="399.49">We are about to update the user agent in Google rendering.</span> <span data-start="399.49" data-end="400.95">So please, please, please, if you</span> <span data-start="400.95" data-end="403.29">are having some sort of code that</span> <span data-start="403.29" data-end="406.05">is doing UA sniffing for Googlebot,</span> <span data-start="406.05" data-end="409.38">do not match to the exact string that you saw earlier.</span> <span data-start="409.38" data-end="412.59">Match, basically, very roughly about Googlebot.</span> <span data-start="412.59" data-end="415.11">If you want to know if it's a real Googlebot or not,</span> <span data-start="415.11" data-end="416.39">that is perfectly possible.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="416.39" data-end="418.08">We have documentation on that.</span> <span data-start="418.08" data-end="420.25">You can do a reverse DNS lookup from the IP</span> <span data-start="420.25" data-end="421.75">that we tell you we are coming from.</span> <span data-start="421.75" data-end="424.02">If that resolves towards Google IP addresses,</span> <span data-start="424.02" data-end="425.655">then you know it's an actual Googlebot.</span> <span data-start="425.655" data-end="427.53">Because the user agent string does not really</span> <span data-start="427.53" data-end="429.01">give you that benefit.</span> <span data-start="429.01" data-end="432.66">So please make sure that, if you have workarounds for Googlebot</span> <span data-start="432.66" data-end="436.11">and others, that you are not too strictly matching the user</span> <span data-start="436.11" data-end="437.94">agent in the future going forward,</span> <span data-start="437.94" data-end="441.04">because this change is hopefully happening in December.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="441.04" data-end="442.62">That's what we are aiming for.</span> <span data-start="442.62" data-end="444.037">If you want to learn more, you can</span> <span data-start="444.037" data-end="446.49">go to webmasters.googleblog.com and learn</span> <span data-start="446.49" data-end="448.81">more about this change as well.</span> <span data-start="448.81" data-end="449.64">Cool.</span> <span data-start="449.64" data-end="452.31">Another thing that I oftentimes get asked — </span> <span data-start="452.31" data-end="454.29">and it's a very, very fair question — </span> <span data-start="454.29" data-end="457.65">is what about JavaScript being so much slower in indexing</span> <span data-start="457.65" data-end="461.16">and rendering in Google Search than non-JavaScript websites.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="461.16" data-end="463.63">Is that still a problem?</span> <span data-start="463.63" data-end="467.53">Well, last year, Tom and I were on this stage</span> <span data-start="467.53" data-end="470.72">and telling you well, you know, it can take up to a week.</span> <span data-start="470.72" data-end="472.51">We are very sorry for this.</span> <span data-start="472.51" data-end="474.76">Forget this, OK?</span> <span data-start="474.76" data-end="477.86">Because the new numbers look a lot better.</span> <span data-start="477.86" data-end="479.41">So we actually went over the numbers</span> <span data-start="479.41" data-end="484.33">and found that it turns out that at median, the time we spend</span> <span data-start="484.33" data-end="488.38">between crawling and actually having the rendered results,</span> <span data-start="488.38" data-end="491.494">on-median, it's five seconds.</span> <span data-start="491.494" data-end="494.43">[APPLAUSE]</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="494.43" data-end="496.23">Right?</span> <span data-start="496.23" data-end="498.42">A few keen eyes here might be like, oh,</span> <span data-start="498.42" data-end="500.838">but what's the 90th percentile?</span> <span data-start="500.838" data-end="502.63">To which I can say, don't worry about that.</span> <span data-start="502.63" data-end="504.13">That's within minutes.</span> <span data-start="504.13" data-end="506.85">So you don't have to worry about week-long delays or something,</span> <span data-start="506.85" data-end="507.88">or anything like that.</span> </p>
