<p><span data-start="20.91" data-end="22.62">How do you install a website?</span> <span data-start="22.62" data-end="25.5">What happens if you don't install it right away?</span> <span data-start="25.5" data-end="27.87">What happens when you're offline?</span> <span data-start="27.87" data-end="31.42">How does it manage local resources?</span> <span data-start="31.42" data-end="34.83">These are the lessons I learned from answering their questions.</span> <span data-start="34.83" data-end="36.87">Hopefully, they'll help you build an experience</span> <span data-start="36.87" data-end="38.82">your users will love.</span> <span data-start="38.82" data-end="41.19">Here we go.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="41.19" data-end="44.97">Number one, dare to be offline.</span> <span data-start="44.97" data-end="46.77">When a user is offline, they don't</span> <span data-start="46.77" data-end="49.8">expect to be able to get to a website,</span> <span data-start="49.8" data-end="53.52">let alone enjoy any of its features.</span> <span data-start="53.52" data-end="57.24">As a developer, you might even be convinced that your app just</span> <span data-start="57.24" data-end="60.24">doesn't make sense offline.</span> <span data-start="60.24" data-end="63.96">And because a PWA requires an offline experience,</span> <span data-start="63.96" data-end="66.36">you can create a custom page that</span> <span data-start="66.36" data-end="70.59">asks users to come back later when there is a connection.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="70.59" data-end="74.37">Instead, how about creating different features?</span> <span data-start="74.37" data-end="77.34">You can't give users full functionality,</span> <span data-start="77.34" data-end="79.95">but some parts could still work.</span> <span data-start="79.95" data-end="82.77">With the use of device storage and caching,</span> <span data-start="82.77" data-end="86.67">for example, users can't get to the latest posts,</span> <span data-start="86.67" data-end="90.54">but they could interact with previously retrieved posts.</span> <span data-start="90.54" data-end="92.94">They could comment and add reactions.</span> <span data-start="92.94" data-end="96.54">You can save those interactions locally and see them later</span> <span data-start="96.54" data-end="98.31">when they are back online.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="98.31" data-end="100.45">Random searches are impossible.</span> <span data-start="100.45" data-end="102.21">But if you have cached recent results,</span> <span data-start="102.21" data-end="105.57">they answer they are looking for may be there.</span> <span data-start="105.57" data-end="106.41">The result?</span> <span data-start="106.41" data-end="107.61">Happy user.</span> <span data-start="107.61" data-end="110.28">And you didn't even need the internet!</span> <span data-start="110.28" data-end="112.32">By the way, since you don't know when</span> <span data-start="112.32" data-end="114.63">a user is going to be offline or when</span> <span data-start="114.63" data-end="116.48">the phone is going to be turned off,</span> <span data-start="116.48" data-end="120.12">it's a good practice to save snapshots in workflows</span> <span data-start="120.12" data-end="122.49">so that the users don't lose a lot of work</span> <span data-start="122.49" data-end="125.1">in case of an interruption.</span> <span data-start="125.1" data-end="128.669">Number two, use device storage wisely.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="128.669" data-end="132.21">On the web, our apps seem to have unlimited storage.</span> <span data-start="132.21" data-end="134.58">But in a device, it's a different story.</span> <span data-start="134.58" data-end="136.5">There are hard limits.</span> <span data-start="136.5" data-end="139.38">Keep tabs on how much space is available.</span> <span data-start="139.38" data-end="141.21">You don't want your app to just stop</span> <span data-start="141.21" data-end="144.27">working in the middle of recording a video.</span> <span data-start="144.27" data-end="148.17">You can use Storage Manager to calculate available space,</span> <span data-start="148.17" data-end="152.37">and then show the user warnings so they can take action.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="152.37" data-end="156.3">Also, choose wisely which method is more appropriate to save</span> <span data-start="156.3" data-end="157.53">the local data.</span> <span data-start="157.53" data-end="160.47">Some options are cached API — </span> <span data-start="160.47" data-end="162.75">which, by the way, can be accessed directly</span> <span data-start="162.75" data-end="164.52">from the window object.</span> <span data-start="164.52" data-end="166.92">It doesn't need to go through a service worker.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="166.92" data-end="168.18">IndexedDB.</span> <span data-start="168.18" data-end="170.13">A good use case here are operations</span> <span data-start="170.13" data-end="174.42">that need a transaction or the native file system API.</span> <span data-start="174.42" data-end="178.11">It is not fully available yet, but you can start to experiment</span> <span data-start="178.11" data-end="179.23">with it.</span> <span data-start="179.23" data-end="181.92">Check out the link in the description for more info.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="181.92" data-end="185.83">Also, don't keep local data longer than necessary.</span> <span data-start="185.83" data-end="187.86">Once you can sync the data to the cloud,</span> <span data-start="187.86" data-end="190.2">free up space in the device.</span> <span data-start="190.2" data-end="193.69">And clear all local data when appropriate —  for example,</span> <span data-start="193.69" data-end="196.36">when the user signs out.</span> <span data-start="196.36" data-end="201.19">Number three, embrace multi-device journeys.</span> <span data-start="201.19" data-end="203.56">Users have multiple devices.</span> <span data-start="203.56" data-end="207.25">They jump from one another and pick up where they left.</span> <span data-start="207.25" data-end="210.58">At least, that is their expectation.</span> <span data-start="210.58" data-end="213.64">As users, we want to start a task on our computer</span> <span data-start="213.64" data-end="218.54">and send it to our phone to be continued, and vice versa.</span> <span data-start="218.54" data-end="221.39">It is pretty convenient to take a picture with our phone.</span> <span data-start="221.39" data-end="223.97">But also, a big screen and a keyboard</span> <span data-start="223.97" data-end="227.1">are nice to edit photos and type captions.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="227.1" data-end="230.32">Another example is content consumption.</span> <span data-start="230.32" data-end="233.2">We consume content on our phone in a different way</span> <span data-start="233.2" data-end="235.82">than we do on a larger screen.</span> <span data-start="235.82" data-end="237.73">Users want to be able to take advantage</span> <span data-start="237.73" data-end="239.65">of the real estate that is available</span> <span data-start="239.65" data-end="242.86">and consume content in the most efficient and enjoyable way</span> <span data-start="242.86" data-end="244.22">for them.</span> <span data-start="244.22" data-end="246.25">Building different layouts also helps</span> <span data-start="246.25" data-end="249.44">with making your app more accessible and inclusive.</span> <span data-start="249.44" data-end="252.82">Your users know that no matter what device they're using,</span> <span data-start="252.82" data-end="255.46">your app will provide the appropriate experience</span> <span data-start="255.46" data-end="259.06">for their journey across different form factors.</span> <span data-start="259.06" data-end="263.05">Number four, bring your users with you.</span> <span data-start="263.05" data-end="265.84">Progressive web apps are still new for users.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="265.84" data-end="267.79">They might not realize they have landed</span> <span data-start="267.79" data-end="270.67">on a website with special capabilities.</span> <span data-start="270.67" data-end="273.18">Help them along the way.</span> <span data-start="273.18" data-end="277.24">Prompt your users to install your app when it is convenient.</span> <span data-start="277.24" data-end="280.48">For a while, we used the browser's default prompt.</span> <span data-start="280.48" data-end="283.45">Unfortunately, it would interrupt our users</span> <span data-start="283.45" data-end="286.08">in the middle of our getting started flow.</span> <span data-start="286.08" data-end="289.69">The prompt would go away, and users would</span> <span data-start="289.69" data-end="291.91">forget to install our app.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="291.91" data-end="295">Now, you can capture the before install prompt event</span> <span data-start="295" data-end="298.36">and prompt the users at a later time.</span> <span data-start="298.36" data-end="303.06">You can use headers, banners, menus, and others.</span> <span data-start="303.06" data-end="306.04">I added a link to an article in the description that walks you</span> <span data-start="306.04" data-end="308.15">through different patterns.</span> <span data-start="308.15" data-end="311.27">You can also help your users by adding tips in your UI</span> <span data-start="311.27" data-end="314.03">the first time they go through a workflow.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="314.03" data-end="317.32">You can highlight things like what data will be available</span> <span data-start="317.32" data-end="319.54">offline or what parts of your app</span> <span data-start="319.54" data-end="321.34">will work in the background.</span> <span data-start="321.34" data-end="323.59">Finally, don't ask for permissions</span> <span data-start="323.59" data-end="326.74">until the user is trying a specific feature.</span> <span data-start="326.74" data-end="329.11">Don't ask for camera access until the user</span> <span data-start="329.11" data-end="331">is going to take a picture.</span> <span data-start="331" data-end="334.39">This makes the user understand why you need permissions,</span> <span data-start="334.39" data-end="337.06">and they will be more willing to grant them.</span> <span data-start="337.06" data-end="340.72">Number five, beware of service workers.</span> <span data-start="340.72" data-end="343.12">Service workers are powerful and are</span> <span data-start="343.12" data-end="346">central in implementing several of my tips.</span> <span data-start="346" data-end="348.25">For example, you can use background sync</span> <span data-start="348.25" data-end="351.02">to upload large amounts of data.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="351.02" data-end="353.02">Even when the app is closed, they also</span> <span data-start="353.02" data-end="355.63">make possible to make good use of notifications</span> <span data-start="355.63" data-end="357.82">and re-engage your users.</span> <span data-start="357.82" data-end="360.49">Maybe to remind your users of unfinished task</span> <span data-start="360.49" data-end="362.41">or of new content.</span> <span data-start="362.41" data-end="365.93">However, service workers can be tricky.</span> <span data-start="365.93" data-end="368.58">The best approach is to generate it.</span> <span data-start="368.58" data-end="370.72">There are tools like Workbox that</span> <span data-start="370.72" data-end="374.38">can help you generate a service worker with the strategies</span> <span data-start="374.38" data-end="376.01">your app needs.</span> <span data-start="376.01" data-end="379.72">Finally, keeping your service worker code to a minimum</span> <span data-start="379.72" data-end="382.24">will also make your app easier to test.</span> <span data-start="382.24" data-end="384.51">This way, you'll implement behaviors</span> <span data-start="384.51" data-end="388">in helper classes that can be better unit tested.</span> <span data-start="388" data-end="389.45">Thank you for watching.</span> <span data-start="389.45" data-end="393.07">I hope you got some new ideas to make your PWA give users</span> <span data-start="393.07" data-end="396.34">the best of the web and native experiences.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="396.34" data-end="398.08">I included links in the description</span> <span data-start="398.08" data-end="400.72">to help you implement these tips.</span> <span data-start="400.72" data-end="403.09">Don't forget to subscribe and share with your friends.</span> <span data-start="403.09" data-end="406.14">[MUSIC PLAYING]</span> </p>
