<p><span data-start="48.27" data-end="51.57">Spotify globally and Ghana in India</span> <span data-start="51.57" data-end="53.58">are both in great success.</span> <span data-start="53.58" data-end="56.81">And it's just the beginning.</span> <span data-start="56.81" data-end="59.06">In the next 20 minutes or so, Angie and I</span> <span data-start="59.06" data-end="60.59">will watch you [INAUDIBLE].</span> <span data-start="60.59" data-end="63.47">We think will help you build great and modern media</span> <span data-start="63.47" data-end="64.8">experiences.</span> <span data-start="64.8" data-end="68.51">We'll cover multitasking with picture-in-picture, bandwidth</span> <span data-start="68.51" data-end="72.86">saving with the 81 video codec, a brand new way of switching</span> <span data-start="72.86" data-end="77.69">codec seamlessly, and finally, playback quality predictability</span> <span data-start="77.69" data-end="79.34">with the media capabilities API.</span> <span data-start="82.29" data-end="84.39">Let me tell you a little bit about myself first</span> <span data-start="84.39" data-end="86.25">and how I work.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="86.25" data-end="88.56">I love to multitask on my computers</span> <span data-start="88.56" data-end="90.63">doing many thing at the same time — </span> <span data-start="90.63" data-end="93.6">browsing, obviously, writing some code,</span> <span data-start="93.6" data-end="96.12">sharing news on social media platforms,</span> <span data-start="96.12" data-end="98.62">watching educational videos, and so on.</span> <span data-start="98.62" data-end="100.77">This is what I do on a daily basis.</span> <span data-start="100.77" data-end="103.5">And I'm quite sure I'm not the only one to do that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="103.5" data-end="106.62">But you may wonder, Francois, this looks cool,</span> <span data-start="106.62" data-end="108.51">but are you good at it?</span> <span data-start="108.51" data-end="111.42">Does that make you more productive?</span> <span data-start="111.42" data-end="113.86">This does not matter.</span> <span data-start="113.86" data-end="116.44">I love to do that, and I want to be efficient at it.</span> <span data-start="116.44" data-end="118.59">But it is not always easy.</span> <span data-start="118.59" data-end="122.77">For instance, watching a video while I'm coding,</span> <span data-start="122.77" data-end="124.12">how's that work?</span> <span data-start="124.12" data-end="127.11">First, I have to open a separate YouTube window,</span> <span data-start="127.11" data-end="129.1">move it to a corner of my screen,</span> <span data-start="129.1" data-end="131.44">and making sure other windows are not covering it.</span> <span data-start="131.44" data-end="134.24">And only then I can start to enjoy.</span> <span data-start="134.24" data-end="136.09">But can you imagine my frustration</span> <span data-start="136.09" data-end="138.58">when window position are not remembered,</span> <span data-start="138.58" data-end="143.6">or when some new window open in the middle of my little video?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="143.6" data-end="144.82">But that's OK.</span> <span data-start="144.82" data-end="147.04">That's OK, because today, a brand new web API</span> <span data-start="147.04" data-end="151.68">called picture-in-picture solved that very specific use case.</span> <span data-start="151.68" data-end="153.96">Picture-in-picture, also known as PIP,</span> <span data-start="153.96" data-end="156.21">is a common feature in television</span> <span data-start="156.21" data-end="159.93">that allows users to watch video in a floating window</span> <span data-start="159.93" data-end="162.554">always on top of other window, so that they</span> <span data-start="162.554" data-end="164.97">can keep an eye on what they're watching while interacting</span> <span data-start="164.97" data-end="167.58">with other sites' obligations.</span> <span data-start="167.58" data-end="170.79">The BBC website actually picture-in-picture a month ago.</span> <span data-start="170.79" data-end="173.99">And they're quite happy with the early result they got.</span> <span data-start="173.99" data-end="176.11">Now, like I said earlier, I like to write code.</span> <span data-start="176.11" data-end="179.019">So let me show some code.</span> <span data-start="179.019" data-end="181.06">To enter picture-in-picture on the video element,</span> <span data-start="181.06" data-end="183.7">you simply have to call request picture-in-picture</span> <span data-start="183.7" data-end="185.11">on a video element.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="185.11" data-end="187.18">And because this call is asynchronous,</span> <span data-start="187.18" data-end="190.64">it will return a promise that can either resolve or reject.</span> <span data-start="190.64" data-end="193.15">And I'll explain why it can reject in a bit.</span> <span data-start="193.15" data-end="194.8">The important thing to notice here</span> <span data-start="194.8" data-end="197.47">is that the user has to interact with the page first</span> <span data-start="197.47" data-end="200.02">to be able to enter picture-in-picture.</span> <span data-start="200.02" data-end="201.61">In this example, I use the button.</span> <span data-start="204.62" data-end="207.96">Making this button a toggle button</span> <span data-start="207.96" data-end="209.93">is quite straightforward.</span> <span data-start="209.93" data-end="211.85">By checking if the video element is not</span> <span data-start="211.85" data-end="214.19">the document that picture-in-picture element,</span> <span data-start="214.19" data-end="216.32">in other words, already in picture-in-picture,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="216.32" data-end="218.12">I'll proceed as before.</span> <span data-start="218.12" data-end="222.49">If it is, let's call document dot exit picture-in-picture.</span> <span data-start="222.49" data-end="226.82">Requesting picture-in-picture may reject for several reasons.</span> <span data-start="226.82" data-end="229.33">The most common ones being the video metadata not</span> <span data-start="229.33" data-end="233.26">loaded yet, picture-in-picture not supported by the platform,</span> <span data-start="233.26" data-end="235.82">or simply not allowed by the user.</span> <span data-start="235.82" data-end="240.48">The full list of reasons is available in the documentation.</span> <span data-start="240.48" data-end="242.79">Updating your website when the video</span> <span data-start="242.79" data-end="246.07">is playing in [INAUDIBLE] picture-in-picture is crucial.</span> <span data-start="246.07" data-end="248.04">And you may think that waiting for the request</span> <span data-start="248.04" data-end="250.44">picture-in-picture promise to wait is good enough,</span> <span data-start="250.44" data-end="252.75">but it is not.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="252.75" data-end="255.06">What if the video enters picture-in-picture from</span> <span data-start="255.06" data-end="256.839">another path, for instance?</span> <span data-start="256.839" data-end="259.17">What if the user clicked the browser context menu,</span> <span data-start="259.17" data-end="262.2">for instance, or the browser triggered picture-in-picture</span> <span data-start="262.2" data-end="264.99">automatically, like Chrome does on full-screen video</span> <span data-start="264.99" data-end="266.46">on Android?</span> <span data-start="266.46" data-end="270">This is why I strongly recommend you update your layout</span> <span data-start="270" data-end="272.07">and enter and leave picture-in-picture event</span> <span data-start="272.07" data-end="274.9">listeners.</span> <span data-start="274.9" data-end="278.74">Now, having a 4K video playing in a small window</span> <span data-start="278.74" data-end="279.93">may not be what you want.</span> <span data-start="279.93" data-end="284.47">So to adjust the quality of the video</span> <span data-start="284.47" data-end="286.39">based on the picture-in-picture window size,</span> <span data-start="286.39" data-end="288.16">you can simply check the width and height</span> <span data-start="288.16" data-end="290.35">attribute of the picture-in-picture window</span> <span data-start="290.35" data-end="293.5">available in the enter picture-in-picture event.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="293.5" data-end="295">Too many picture-in-picture, I know.</span> <span data-start="297.63" data-end="299.479">Adding a resize amount to this object</span> <span data-start="299.479" data-end="301.27">would also let you know when to user resize</span> <span data-start="301.27" data-end="303.52">the picture-in-picture window so that you</span> <span data-start="303.52" data-end="305.11">can update the video quality.</span> <span data-start="305.11" data-end="307.87">By the way, Angie will work you later</span> <span data-start="307.87" data-end="310.18">on how to change seamlessly the video quality</span> <span data-start="310.18" data-end="314.62">and the codec container to help with that.</span> <span data-start="314.62" data-end="317.55">And finally, defining the availability of your custom</span> <span data-start="317.55" data-end="319.29">picture-in-picture button should be</span> <span data-start="319.29" data-end="322.35">as easy as taking the Boolean value of document dot</span> <span data-start="322.35" data-end="324.81">picture-in-picture enable, but it is not.</span> <span data-start="324.81" data-end="327.64">Because you want your website to be perfect.</span> <span data-start="327.64" data-end="330.73">So you also have to check if the HTML video attribute</span> <span data-start="330.73" data-end="333.73">desirable picture-in-picture is present.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="333.73" data-end="335.7">And finally, for real this time, you</span> <span data-start="335.7" data-end="338.45">have to check if the video is actually ready to play.</span> <span data-start="338.45" data-end="341.01">And only then, you'll get a perfect implementation</span> <span data-start="341.01" data-end="343.2">for your custom picture-in-picture button</span> <span data-start="343.2" data-end="345.97">in your media player.</span> <span data-start="345.97" data-end="348.55">I'm glad to say that we have shaped picture-in-picture API</span> <span data-start="348.55" data-end="352.48">last month Chrome 70 in Linux, Mac and Windows.</span> <span data-start="352.48" data-end="354.437">Chrome OS and Android are coming soon.</span> <span data-start="354.437" data-end="356.77">And we're looking forward to see all the browser vendors</span> <span data-start="356.77" data-end="359.53">implement this API as well.</span> <span data-start="359.53" data-end="364.92">You'll find all documentation and sample units at this URL.</span> <span data-start="364.92" data-end="369.21">Now, what if I tell you this is just the tip of the iceberg?</span> <span data-start="369.21" data-end="374.07">In Chrome 71, currently, beta will support media stream video</span> <span data-start="374.07" data-end="377.93">in picture-in-picture.</span> <span data-start="377.93" data-end="379.91">These two little lines up java script</span> <span data-start="379.91" data-end="381.89">do what you think it does.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="400.57" data-end="402.37">But wait, there's more.</span> <span data-start="402.37" data-end="404.89">Soon, a brand new web API, called screen capture,</span> <span data-start="404.89" data-end="408.28">will allow a website in Chrome to capture a screen to a media</span> <span data-start="408.28" data-end="411.73">stream for recording or sharing over the network.</span> <span data-start="411.73" data-end="414.35">This API will enable a number of web applications,</span> <span data-start="414.35" data-end="416.62">including screen sharing.</span> <span data-start="416.62" data-end="420.43">Imagine now if you combine these APIs with picture-in-picture.</span> <span data-start="420.43" data-end="422.38">Let's have a look at this code.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="422.38" data-end="425.71">After getting the screen, we display media.</span> <span data-start="425.71" data-end="428.92">And the voice audio stream will get user media.</span> <span data-start="428.92" data-end="431.86">I create from scratch a new media stream,</span> <span data-start="431.86" data-end="434.5">but contains the screen video stream,</span> <span data-start="434.5" data-end="437.92">including my picture-in-picture window and my voice</span> <span data-start="437.92" data-end="439.95">as the audio stream.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="439.95" data-end="442.64">This code is simply gorgeous, in my opinion.</span> <span data-start="442.64" data-end="444.02">This is it.</span> <span data-start="444.02" data-end="446.77">There's nothing more.</span> <span data-start="446.77" data-end="449.25">So let me show what this code does with short demo I've</span> <span data-start="449.25" data-end="451.44">created just for you.</span> <span data-start="451.44" data-end="453.182">And can we switch to demo, please?</span> <span data-start="456.35" data-end="461.63">So on the left is me, Francois, the hardcore gamer.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="461.63" data-end="465.43">On the right, it's still me, but this time, as a casual viewer.</span> <span data-start="465.43" data-end="467.42">And what you're going to see on the left</span> <span data-start="467.42" data-end="471.02">is me sharing my screen, including</span> <span data-start="471.02" data-end="472.912">the picture-in-picture window, while I'm</span> <span data-start="472.912" data-end="473.87">playing the diner game.</span> <span data-start="477.22" data-end="480.57">So this is me.</span> <span data-start="480.57" data-end="481.12">Hi, mom.</span> <span data-start="485.9" data-end="489.62">And let's say [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="489.62" data-end="492.25">So like I said, I'm a hardcore game — </span> <span data-start="492.25" data-end="493.28">OK, sorry, I lied.</span> <span data-start="493.28" data-end="494.744">[LAUGHTER]</span> <span data-start="496.602" data-end="498.31">So keep in mind that the code you've just</span> <span data-start="498.31" data-end="500.51">seen with 10 more lines of java script</span> <span data-start="500.51" data-end="504.14">involving the media we called API and some web sockets</span> <span data-start="504.14" data-end="508.16">are pretty much the entire code for this demo.</span> <span data-start="508.16" data-end="511.77">Can we switch back to the slides, please?</span> <span data-start="511.77" data-end="513.6">The demo is available for you on Glitch</span> <span data-start="513.6" data-end="517.2">if you want to play with it later on.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="606.724" data-end="607.724"><span class="speaker">Angie Chiang</span>: Thank you.</span> <span data-start="611.55" data-end="613.32">Thank you, Francois.</span> <span data-start="613.32" data-end="614.47">Hi, everyone.</span> <span data-start="614.47" data-end="617.13">I'm Angie from Google's web engine.</span> <span data-start="617.13" data-end="620.07">Today, I'm going to share with you</span> <span data-start="620.07" data-end="624.165">a new generation video codec, AV1, was launched recently.</span> <span data-start="627.16" data-end="630.04">So we have three main goals for AV1.</span> <span data-start="630.04" data-end="635.55">First off, we want AV1 to provide state-of-the-art</span> <span data-start="635.55" data-end="639.42">compression efficiency among other codecs.</span> <span data-start="639.42" data-end="643.66">Secondly, we want AV1 to be accessible by everyone,</span> <span data-start="643.66" data-end="647.79">so we made it an open source project, and it's royalty-free.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="647.79" data-end="653.85">Finally, we want to deploy AV1 right away and quickly.</span> <span data-start="653.85" data-end="657.39">So before I jump into how we did or will</span> <span data-start="657.39" data-end="661.05">do to achieve these goals, let me explain a little bit</span> <span data-start="661.05" data-end="663.765">why video compression is important for users.</span> <span data-start="668.18" data-end="675.03">To visualize the importance of compression for video service,</span> <span data-start="675.03" data-end="677.06">let me give you an example.</span> <span data-start="677.06" data-end="682.48">Using Edge 264, a five minute HD-compressed video</span> <span data-start="682.48" data-end="685.38">will take about 300 megabytes.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="685.38" data-end="688.7">On the other hand, the uncompressed version</span> <span data-start="688.7" data-end="693.59">will take about 25 gigabytes, 80 times larger</span> <span data-start="693.59" data-end="696.05">than the compressed version.</span> <span data-start="696.05" data-end="698.78">This means, without video compression,</span> <span data-start="698.78" data-end="701.57">watching video online will eat up all your internet</span> <span data-start="701.57" data-end="707.78">bandwidth, not to mention the sky-rocket costs of storage</span> <span data-start="707.78" data-end="708.34">on the cloud.</span> <span data-start="711.5" data-end="715.73">So more compression gives the user better user experience.</span> <span data-start="715.73" data-end="718.94">We have seen the proof of this with VP9,</span> <span data-start="718.94" data-end="721.54">the predecessor of AV1.</span> <span data-start="721.54" data-end="728.06">YouTube did a comprehensive AV experiment when launching VP9.</span> <span data-start="728.06" data-end="733.65">Compared to H.264, performance improved in a number of ways,</span> <span data-start="733.65" data-end="736.82">ultimately result in higher watch time.</span> <span data-start="736.82" data-end="739.4">This is due to VP9's outperforming coding</span> <span data-start="739.4" data-end="740.09">efficiency.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="742.97" data-end="745.93">With AV1, we have done it again.</span> <span data-start="745.93" data-end="749.88">A new generate codec provides 30% [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span data-start="749.88" data-end="756.08">reduction over VP9 across a variety of video qualities.</span> <span data-start="756.08" data-end="761">This means, given the [INAUDIBLE] quality,</span> <span data-start="761" data-end="765.8">AV1's video size will be 30% smaller than VP9.</span> <span data-start="765.8" data-end="770.61">This project integrated over 100 algorithm tools,</span> <span data-start="770.61" data-end="773.84">including the technologies from open source projects,</span> <span data-start="773.84" data-end="775.7">like Mozilla's [INAUDIBLE] project</span> <span data-start="775.7" data-end="779.63">and Cisco's SOAR project.</span> <span data-start="779.63" data-end="785.39">And again, AV1 is an open source project, and it's royalty-free.</span> <span data-start="785.39" data-end="791.45">So its development community alliance for open media</span> <span data-start="791.45" data-end="796.19">has attracted 40 companies to join and to contribute</span> <span data-start="796.19" data-end="799.33">their technologies into AV1.</span> <span data-start="799.33" data-end="803.45">There are content providers, streaming service providers,</span> <span data-start="803.45" data-end="807.05">and power companies which cover a wide spectrum</span> <span data-start="807.05" data-end="810.35">of the ecosystem for video on the web.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="810.35" data-end="814.94">Having Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla</span> <span data-start="814.94" data-end="818.33">means we can have AV1 to work everywhere on the web platform.</span> <span data-start="822.1" data-end="825.03">So we have been working hard toward this goal.</span> <span data-start="825.03" data-end="831.09">In this quarter, AV1 decoder is supported by Chrome browser.</span> <span data-start="831.09" data-end="835.44">And we started sorting video content from YouTube.</span> <span data-start="835.44" data-end="840.45">Firefox and Edge are also launched in the beta platform</span> <span data-start="840.45" data-end="842.01">last month.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="842.01" data-end="846.02">And we plan to integrate the AV1 with web RTC</span> <span data-start="846.02" data-end="848.55">and to deploy AV1 into Android platform</span> <span data-start="848.55" data-end="850.99">in the following years.</span> <span data-start="850.99" data-end="854.29">[INAUDIBLE] support is also under development,</span> <span data-start="854.29" data-end="858.45">first arriving in 2020 for TVs and mobile handsets.</span> <span data-start="861.78" data-end="864.97">For web developers, using AV1 is easy.</span> <span data-start="864.97" data-end="868.65">You simply need to code its type supported function to make sure</span> <span data-start="868.65" data-end="870.904">the browser support AV1.</span> <span data-start="870.904" data-end="872.32">Then you can start play the video.</span> <span data-start="875.94" data-end="877.98">So AV1 is very exciting.</span> <span data-start="877.98" data-end="881.04">But rolling out AV1 is not easy.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="881.04" data-end="885.78">To ease the process of the codec transition.</span> <span data-start="885.78" data-end="887.94">a new change type function is supported</span> <span data-start="887.94" data-end="892.8">on Chrome browser, which allow the browser to switch one</span> <span data-start="892.8" data-end="895.9">codec to the other seamlessly.</span> <span data-start="895.9" data-end="898.6">So for example, when AV1 is not performing</span> <span data-start="898.6" data-end="902.4">on some low-end devices, the string service</span> <span data-start="902.4" data-end="905.78">can always fall back to VP9, which is less complex</span> <span data-start="905.78" data-end="907.17">and may have [INAUDIBLE] support.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="911.46" data-end="914.17">Here is a simple call for using change type.</span> <span data-start="914.17" data-end="918.52">So initially, we add a source buffer using VP9.</span> <span data-start="918.52" data-end="921.22">And later on, we can call a change type function</span> <span data-start="921.22" data-end="922.13">to switch to AV1.</span> <span data-start="925.08" data-end="927.81">Let me give you some demo about change type.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="946.52" data-end="951.08">So we start playing video using Edge 264.</span> <span data-start="951.08" data-end="958.3">You can see that from the top left corner,</span> <span data-start="958.3" data-end="961.96">by clicking the button, we can switch to AV1.</span> <span data-start="961.96" data-end="962.99">Now, we are using AV1.</span> <span data-start="973.54" data-end="978.76">By clicking the button again, now, we</span> <span data-start="978.76" data-end="982.48">switch back to Edge 264.</span> <span data-start="982.48" data-end="984.85">You can't tell there's a transition, right?</span> <span data-start="984.85" data-end="988.07">I think this is really cool.</span> <span data-start="988.07" data-end="991.7">Let's go back to the slide.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="991.7" data-end="994.64">This is a support slide, where you can find information</span> <span data-start="994.64" data-end="997.52">about AV1 decoder and change type.</span> <span data-start="1001.01" data-end="1003.72">Please, welcome back on stage Francois,</span> <span data-start="1003.72" data-end="1006.36">who's going to talk about playback predictability</span> <span data-start="1006.36" data-end="1008.594">with media capabilities API.</span> <span data-start="1008.594" data-end="1010.45">[APPLAUSE]</span> <span data-start="1010.45" data-end="1011.378">Francois.</span> <span data-start="1011.378" data-end="1012.77">[MUSIC PLAYING]</span> <span data-start="1012.77" data-end="1013.7">Thank you.</span> </p>
