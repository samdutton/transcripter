<p><span data-start="6.395" data-end="9.12">And we'll look at an example of a major health care solution</span> <span data-start="9.12" data-end="12.03">provider that is building a progressive web app to overcome</span> <span data-start="12.03" data-end="14.16">the challenges of moving to the cloud</span> <span data-start="14.16" data-end="17.11">while meeting the needs of mobile workers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="17.11" data-end="18.69">So I spend a lot of my time working</span> <span data-start="18.69" data-end="21.33">with health care solution providers and their customers.</span> <span data-start="21.33" data-end="23.07">Based on what we're seeing in the market,</span> <span data-start="23.07" data-end="25.62">the benefits for health care systems to move to the cloud</span> <span data-start="25.62" data-end="26.43">is clear.</span> <span data-start="26.43" data-end="28.53">First, let's look at the patients.</span> <span data-start="28.53" data-end="30.87">Based on a study by Accenture, the opportunity</span> <span data-start="30.87" data-end="34.08">to improve the experience for digitally-savvy patients</span> <span data-start="34.08" data-end="36.93">can boost margins by 50%.</span> <span data-start="36.93" data-end="40.35">For clinicians, the shift to cloud apps and mobile devices</span> <span data-start="40.35" data-end="43.71">can reduce paperwork by 60% and increase patient face time</span> <span data-start="43.71" data-end="47.73">by 29%, helping to mitigate the risk of physician burnout</span> <span data-start="47.73" data-end="49.99">while improving the quality of care.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="49.99" data-end="52.65">But moving to the cloud from traditional desktop apps</span> <span data-start="52.65" data-end="54.7">has not been easy in health care.</span> <span data-start="54.7" data-end="57.21">So for example, let's think about the day in the life</span> <span data-start="57.21" data-end="59.13">of an emergency medical technician,</span> <span data-start="59.13" data-end="62.76">or EMT, moving from helicopter to ambulance</span> <span data-start="62.76" data-end="66.99">to hospital while updating vital patient information.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="66.99" data-end="69.72">To address the needs of mobile health workers while shifting</span> <span data-start="69.72" data-end="72.06">mission-critical applications to the cloud,</span> <span data-start="72.06" data-end="75.24">health care solution providers and IT leaders need a way</span> <span data-start="75.24" data-end="77.74">to deal with a variety of issues â€” </span> <span data-start="77.74" data-end="81.15">flaky networks, lots of mobile workers,</span> <span data-start="81.15" data-end="83.88">clinicians using multiple form factors,</span> <span data-start="83.88" data-end="86.73">ensuring the security and privacy of patient data</span> <span data-start="86.73" data-end="90.69">while making it accessible anywhere and on any device,</span> <span data-start="90.69" data-end="93.84">and making it feel like a native app experience.</span> <span data-start="93.84" data-end="95.46">We're now seeing health care solution</span> <span data-start="95.46" data-end="98.1">providers shift to progressive web apps</span> <span data-start="98.1" data-end="99.69">to address these issues.</span> <span data-start="99.69" data-end="101.82">But what do we mean by progressive web apps,</span> <span data-start="101.82" data-end="103.08">and how can they help?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="103.08" data-end="106.14">Progressive web apps are just like any other web app.</span> <span data-start="106.14" data-end="108.45">The key difference is that they have adopted</span> <span data-start="108.45" data-end="111.15">progressive features, such as service workers</span> <span data-start="111.15" data-end="114.88">to enable background processes and offline access,</span> <span data-start="114.88" data-end="117.87">and a web app manifest to allow for the web app</span> <span data-start="117.87" data-end="119.82">to be installed alongside other apps</span> <span data-start="119.82" data-end="123.56">on a computer with the look and feel of a desktop app.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="123.56" data-end="127.25">Service workers ensure that PWAs are always up to date</span> <span data-start="127.25" data-end="130.58">and can be accessed offline, mitigating flaky network</span> <span data-start="130.58" data-end="131.63">issues.</span> <span data-start="131.63" data-end="134.33">This feature increases reliability and speed</span> <span data-start="134.33" data-end="135.71">for workers on the go.</span> <span data-start="135.71" data-end="138.89">And with web app manifest, you can enable your web app</span> <span data-start="138.89" data-end="142">to be installed just like any other desktop app.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="142" data-end="145.07">So with a few changes to your existing web app,</span> <span data-start="145.07" data-end="147.17">you can bring the progressive web app experience</span> <span data-start="147.17" data-end="152.58">to any OS and form factor, all with a single code base.</span> <span data-start="152.58" data-end="154.89">So let's look at an example.</span> <span data-start="154.89" data-end="157.04">One major health care solution provider</span> <span data-start="157.04" data-end="161.892">decided, two years ago, to use Electron for their NextGen EHR.</span> <span data-start="161.892" data-end="163.85">At the time, they felt Electron would give them</span> <span data-start="163.85" data-end="165.74">increased control of the user experience</span> <span data-start="165.74" data-end="168.92">and help them keep their product up to date.</span> <span data-start="168.92" data-end="172.223">But since two years ago, the web has rapidly advanced.</span> <span data-start="172.223" data-end="174.14">And they took another look at the capabilities</span> <span data-start="174.14" data-end="176.84">of PWA and the advanced enterprise security</span> <span data-start="176.84" data-end="180.35">and management features now available on Chrome browser.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="180.35" data-end="182.66">After doing the research, they came to the conclusion</span> <span data-start="182.66" data-end="184.52">that with progressive web apps, they</span> <span data-start="184.52" data-end="186.44">can realize the benefits they had hoped</span> <span data-start="186.44" data-end="190.69">to achieve with Electron while greatly enhancing the security</span> <span data-start="190.69" data-end="193.26">and portability of their application.</span> <span data-start="193.26" data-end="195.44">So they decided to shelve their Electron plans</span> <span data-start="195.44" data-end="197.32">and pivot to PWA.</span> <span data-start="197.32" data-end="199.4">It provided the same benefits that they</span> <span data-start="199.4" data-end="201.41">were trying to get from Electron while making</span> <span data-start="201.41" data-end="202.97">it much easier to ensure their app</span> <span data-start="202.97" data-end="207.33">is highly secure and accessible from any device.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="207.33" data-end="208.94">So what did we learn?</span> <span data-start="208.94" data-end="211.25">Adopting progressive features in your web app</span> <span data-start="211.25" data-end="213.23">creates a native-like experience.</span> <span data-start="213.23" data-end="214.7">To start your journey, look at what</span> <span data-start="214.7" data-end="217.88">you can do with service workers and web app manifest.</span> <span data-start="217.88" data-end="219.92">Service workers for background processes</span> <span data-start="219.92" data-end="224.15">and offline access, web app manifest for installability.</span> <span data-start="224.15" data-end="225.68">With a little development effort,</span> <span data-start="225.68" data-end="227.45">you can provide a native-like experience</span> <span data-start="227.45" data-end="233.12">to any user on any device, all from a single code base.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="233.12" data-end="234.387">Thanks for watching.</span> <span data-start="234.387" data-end="235.97">I've included links in the description</span> <span data-start="235.97" data-end="238.7">for details on how to integrate any of these features.</span> <span data-start="238.7" data-end="239.99">See you next time.</span> <span data-start="239.99" data-end="243.34">[MUSIC PLAYING]</span> </p>
