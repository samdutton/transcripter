<p><span data-start="7.6" data-end="10.16">The web is expanding in exciting new directions</span> <span data-start="10.16" data-end="11.89">and as a platform.</span> <span data-start="11.89" data-end="15.34">With powerful apps like G Suite, Google Earth, or AutoCAD</span> <span data-start="15.34" data-end="17.23">all running in the web browser, more</span> <span data-start="17.23" data-end="20.51">is possible with the modern web than ever before.</span> <span data-start="20.51" data-end="24.43">For example, we have location access, camera, mic,</span> <span data-start="24.43" data-end="27.88">push notifications, offline, WebAssembly.</span> <span data-start="27.88" data-end="30.94">These are just a few examples of modern capabilities</span> <span data-start="30.94" data-end="33.5">that have arrived on the web in the last few years,</span> <span data-start="33.5" data-end="35.45">and there's a lot more coming, too.</span> <span data-start="35.45" data-end="38.62">But this new power often relies on underlying device</span> <span data-start="38.62" data-end="41.14">capabilities.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="41.14" data-end="42.82">The web is a sandbox that's designed</span> <span data-start="42.82" data-end="45.07">to let users safely run untrusted code</span> <span data-start="45.07" data-end="46.21">on their computer.</span> <span data-start="46.21" data-end="49.09">Enabling users to quickly and safely use websites and web</span> <span data-start="49.09" data-end="52.12">apps from untrusted sources with a tap of a finger</span> <span data-start="52.12" data-end="54.17">or click of a mouse in the browser</span> <span data-start="54.17" data-end="56.47">and without downloading and installing software</span> <span data-start="56.47" data-end="58.39">is one of the web superpowers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="58.39" data-end="61.312">The w3c developed a set of ethical principles for the web,</span> <span data-start="61.312" data-end="63.52">and there's two that especially apply to powerful web</span> <span data-start="63.52" data-end="66.16">capabilities and permissions.</span> <span data-start="66.16" data-end="68.5">First, the principle that security and privacy</span> <span data-start="68.5" data-end="71.77">are essential, and second, that the web must enhance</span> <span data-start="71.77" data-end="74.108">a user's control and power.</span> <span data-start="74.108" data-end="76.15">It's tricky to balance the trade-off between user</span> <span data-start="76.15" data-end="77.98">empowerment and safety.</span> <span data-start="77.98" data-end="79.972">Access must be controlled from the web sandbox</span> <span data-start="79.972" data-end="82.18">to any feature that could be used to violate the user</span> <span data-start="82.18" data-end="83.62">security and privacy.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="83.62" data-end="86.32">But browsers must give users control and power</span> <span data-start="86.32" data-end="89.08">to allow access when it's safe to do so and in ways</span> <span data-start="89.08" data-end="91.09">that facilitate their goals.</span> <span data-start="91.09" data-end="93.1">Many advanced web capabilities are effectively</span> <span data-start="93.1" data-end="96.58">letting users open up gateways in and out of the sandbox.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="96.58" data-end="99.13">To adhere to the w3c principles, browsers</span> <span data-start="99.13" data-end="101.358">need to err on the side of user safety.</span> <span data-start="101.358" data-end="103.15">But browsers can't know what a web app will</span> <span data-start="103.15" data-end="105.22">want to do with a given permission,</span> <span data-start="105.22" data-end="110.56">so browser UI for permissions is context free by necessity.</span> <span data-start="110.56" data-end="112.72">Web developers need to help users understand</span> <span data-start="112.72" data-end="115.19">what access their application is requesting</span> <span data-start="115.19" data-end="116.77">and what it will be used for to help</span> <span data-start="116.77" data-end="120.14">users make empowered decisions.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="120.14" data-end="123.01">First, only ask for permission you really need.</span> <span data-start="123.01" data-end="126.29">Trust and fluency are everything in the modern digital world.</span> <span data-start="126.29" data-end="129.43">If a user doesn't understand why you're asking for permission,</span> <span data-start="129.43" data-end="131.14">you've risked your trust with that user.</span> <span data-start="131.14" data-end="133.3">Worse, you may have interrupted their workflow</span> <span data-start="133.3" data-end="135.82">with a prompt, increasing their cognitive load,</span> <span data-start="135.82" data-end="138.61">distraction, and the chances that they won't get value out</span> <span data-start="138.61" data-end="140.65">of your offering.</span> <span data-start="140.65" data-end="143.35">Second, be clear and specific about what you need</span> <span data-start="143.35" data-end="145.72">and why in advance of prompting.</span> <span data-start="145.72" data-end="148.03">Don't assume that your users know what your brand is</span> <span data-start="148.03" data-end="149.68">or what your app does.</span> <span data-start="149.68" data-end="151.57">Explain to them clearly, or make sure</span> <span data-start="151.57" data-end="154.87">the usage is fully aligned to the user's gesture.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="154.87" data-end="157.57">Third, prompt at a contextually relevant moment</span> <span data-start="157.57" data-end="158.8">in the user's journey.</span> <span data-start="158.8" data-end="161.02">Don't ask for permissions upfront.</span> <span data-start="161.02" data-end="163.21">Fourth, degrade gracefully.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="163.21" data-end="165.52">If a user ignores or blocks a permission,</span> <span data-start="165.52" data-end="167.92">make sure your experience still works.</span> <span data-start="167.92" data-end="170.26">Fifth, if a block or ignored permission</span> <span data-start="170.26" data-end="172.34">is needed to use a feature of your app,</span> <span data-start="172.34" data-end="174.25">make this obvious to your users, but don't</span> <span data-start="174.25" data-end="176.917">get in the way of other features that don't need that permission</span> <span data-start="176.917" data-end="178.17">to work.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="178.17" data-end="180.67">These principles will not only make your user's journey more</span> <span data-start="180.67" data-end="183.01">pleasant, they'll contribute to better business metrics</span> <span data-start="183.01" data-end="184.1">as well.</span> <span data-start="184.1" data-end="186.13">Users hate being interrupted, and they hate</span> <span data-start="186.13" data-end="187.63">getting broken experiences.</span> <span data-start="187.63" data-end="189.91">Keeping this principles in mind in your app design</span> <span data-start="189.91" data-end="192.59">makes for a better user journey.</span> <span data-start="192.59" data-end="194.23">Let's do this by example.</span> <span data-start="194.23" data-end="197.89">Don't ask the user if they want to allow push notifications as</span> <span data-start="197.89" data-end="199.9">soon as they land on your website.</span> <span data-start="199.9" data-end="202.18">In the future, Chrome will minify the push permission</span> <span data-start="202.18" data-end="204.97">prompt for sites with very low push accept rates.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="204.97" data-end="207.82">You can already test this feature out in Chrome Canary</span> <span data-start="207.82" data-end="209.5">by enabling the Quieter notification</span> <span data-start="209.5" data-end="211.49">permission prompt flag.</span> <span data-start="211.49" data-end="214.48">Please do prompt for notification permission</span> <span data-start="214.48" data-end="217.48">when there is a clear benefit and a context to the user.</span> <span data-start="221.67" data-end="223.8">Don't prompt for location permission</span> <span data-start="223.8" data-end="225.49">without user context.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="225.49" data-end="227.97">For example, users may not know why</span> <span data-start="227.97" data-end="229.62">they're being asked for their location</span> <span data-start="229.62" data-end="232.83">if there's no map or location UI visible in the page,</span> <span data-start="232.83" data-end="234.48">or if it's below the fold.</span> <span data-start="234.48" data-end="236.88">Please do prompt location permission</span> <span data-start="236.88" data-end="238.71">after an explicit user action.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="242.31" data-end="245.16">Please don't prompt for mic or camera access</span> <span data-start="245.16" data-end="247.11">without explicitly indicating how it's</span> <span data-start="247.11" data-end="248.445">going to be used in advance.</span> <span data-start="254.73" data-end="259.079">Do make use of mic and video permissions where appropriate.</span> <span data-start="259.079" data-end="261.69">Either explain the upcoming prompt in advance,</span> <span data-start="261.69" data-end="264.99">or associate the permission prompt with obvious context</span> <span data-start="264.99" data-end="267.9">such as following a user gesture to start a video or chat</span> <span data-start="267.9" data-end="268.92">session.</span> <span data-start="268.92" data-end="272.13">Please don't fail silently if a user ignored or blocked</span> <span data-start="272.13" data-end="274.56">necessary access for a feature they're trying to use.</span> <span data-start="279.91" data-end="283.33">But do explain why your feature won't work without access,</span> <span data-start="283.33" data-end="284.92">and let your users know they'll need</span> <span data-start="284.92" data-end="287.32">to enable access if they want to use that feature.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="291.44" data-end="293.33">To recap, these are the principles</span> <span data-start="293.33" data-end="295.07">of good permissions request UX.</span> <span data-start="295.07" data-end="298.37">First, only ask for access you really need.</span> <span data-start="298.37" data-end="301.04">Second, be clear and specific.</span> <span data-start="301.04" data-end="304.01">Third, prompt at a contextually relevant moment.</span> <span data-start="304.01" data-end="306.32">Fourth, degrade gracefully.</span> <span data-start="306.32" data-end="309.62">And fifth, when a blocked or ignored permission is needed,</span> <span data-start="309.62" data-end="312.38">make that obvious.</span> <span data-start="312.38" data-end="313.807">Thank you so much for listening.</span> </p>
