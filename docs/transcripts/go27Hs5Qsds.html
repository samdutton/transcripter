<p><span data-start="29.41" data-end="31.37">Web install integrates the web apps</span> <span data-start="31.37" data-end="34.47">with the device services that expect an installed app.</span> <span data-start="34.47" data-end="37.34">The important thing to remember when you're asking a user</span> <span data-start="37.34" data-end="39.875">to install PWA is that with an installed app,</span> <span data-start="39.875" data-end="41.3">you're telling the user that it is</span> <span data-start="41.3" data-end="43.13">an experience that is meant for the device</span> <span data-start="43.13" data-end="44.38">that the user is using.</span> <span data-start="44.38" data-end="45.59">And that means that you need to live up</span> <span data-start="45.59" data-end="47.173">to those expectations what you design,</span> <span data-start="47.173" data-end="48.8">you're going to have unhappy users.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="72.775" data-end="74.9">You don't want to push the user to convert too soon</span> <span data-start="74.9" data-end="76.503">or they'll leave your site running.</span> <span data-start="76.503" data-end="78.17">You should only promote install to users</span> <span data-start="78.17" data-end="80.24">who are frequent users, or who will actually</span> <span data-start="80.24" data-end="83.392">benefit from your services.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="92.05" data-end="93.7">You can make that app install.</span> <span data-start="93.7" data-end="95.71">You can add video effects with Blossom.</span> <span data-start="95.71" data-end="97.78">And you can even bring it into new realities</span> <span data-start="97.78" data-end="100.24">with WebGL and WebVR.</span> <span data-start="100.24" data-end="102.82">But there's still gaps in what we can solve with the web</span> <span data-start="102.82" data-end="104.17">today.</span> <span data-start="104.17" data-end="106.81">In the worst case, this means that developers are not</span> <span data-start="106.81" data-end="109.36">building for the web at all, or they're relegating it</span> <span data-start="109.36" data-end="111.678">to a second class experience.</span> <span data-start="111.678" data-end="113.47">For those that do want to build for the web</span> <span data-start="113.47" data-end="116.05">but need the capabilities of native,</span> <span data-start="116.05" data-end="119.26">they're forced to bundle web apps in native wrappers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="119.26" data-end="121.27">This often results in developers effectively</span> <span data-start="121.27" data-end="124.24">shipping their own custom browsers to users,</span> <span data-start="124.24" data-end="126.31">exploding the size of their web apps,</span> <span data-start="126.31" data-end="129.34">and forcing them to take on the security and maintenance</span> <span data-start="129.34" data-end="131.59">burden of both keeping the browser</span> <span data-start="131.59" data-end="133.87">and their native wrapper up to date.</span> <span data-start="133.87" data-end="136.185">Social apps on mobile devices have been hard,</span> <span data-start="136.185" data-end="138.31">because they need to be tightly integrated in order</span> <span data-start="138.31" data-end="140.47">to be loved by their users.</span> <span data-start="140.47" data-end="142.99">Quinn thinks for themself, "our users</span> <span data-start="142.99" data-end="145.862">want to start a journal entry from anywhere on their device,</span> <span data-start="145.862" data-end="147.82">and they want to be able to share those entries</span> <span data-start="147.82" data-end="149.56">to other social accounts.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="149.56" data-end="152.36">They also want to collaborate on entries with their friends,</span> <span data-start="152.36" data-end="155.26">so they need to be able to invite them to do so easily."</span> <span data-start="155.26" data-end="157.39">Until recently, these capabilities</span> <span data-start="157.39" data-end="159.73">would seem to rule out building a web app.</span> <span data-start="159.73" data-end="162.28">They just simply didn't exist.</span> <span data-start="162.28" data-end="165.4">Both Web Share and the new Web Share Target V2 and Contacts</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="165.4" data-end="168.49">APIs, that calculus has changed, and Quinn</span> <span data-start="168.49" data-end="171.575">can build a progressive web app instead of a native app.</span> <span data-start="171.575" data-end="173.5">Go try it yourself.</span> <span data-start="173.5" data-end="177.51">On your Android device, go to fugu-journal.web.app,</span> <span data-start="177.51" data-end="180.79">add it to your home screen, and try out everything you've seen,</span> <span data-start="180.79" data-end="184.9">inviting friends, adding content, then sharing it out.</span> <span data-start="184.9" data-end="187.88">While the Contacts API isn't fully launched yet,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="187.88" data-end="190.282">I've enabled an origin trial on Fugu Journal</span> <span data-start="190.282" data-end="192.49">so you can see how it works without a special version</span> <span data-start="192.49" data-end="195.66">of Chrome, or toggling any Chrome flags.</span> <span data-start="195.66" data-end="198.37">And again, you can try this out yourself.</span> <span data-start="198.37" data-end="202.93">On your computer, go to fugu-edit.web.app, install it,</span> <span data-start="202.93" data-end="205.84">and try to open the files and folders and save them as you</span> <span data-start="205.84" data-end="206.92">normally would.</span> <span data-start="206.92" data-end="210.04">Go to webwewant.fyi to let us know</span> <span data-start="210.04" data-end="212.53">what you'd like to see added to the web platform</span> <span data-start="212.53" data-end="216.51">to help you bridge the native app gap.</span> </p>
