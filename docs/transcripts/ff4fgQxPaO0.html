<p><span data-start="0.08" data-end="1.08">Hi gang!</span> <span data-start="1.08" data-end="2.85">My name is Mathias, and I work on Chrome.</span> <span data-start="2.85" data-end="8.28">Today, I’d like to highlight a handy little JavaScript performance trick that’s a little bit surprising,</span> <span data-start="8.28" data-end="10.88">and somewhat counterintuitive.</span> <span data-start="10.88" data-end="16.57">JavaScript applications, and in particular web apps, commonly use large objects to represent</span> <span data-start="16.57" data-end="18.8">state or other data.</span> <span data-start="18.8" data-end="22.16">The example we’re looking at right now is very simple and small,</span> <span data-start="22.16" data-end="28.09">…but on the web it’s surprisingly common to see objects of several kilobytes in size, especially</span> <span data-start="28.09" data-end="33.49">for web apps built using frameworks such as React or Redux.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="33.49" data-end="38.75">Unfortunately, web apps often depend on this data for their initial render.</span> <span data-start="38.76" data-end="43.64">In such cases, this large JavaScript object ends up on the critical path,</span> <span data-start="43.64" data-end="48.08">and so, users end up staring at a blank screen until all of this data is</span> <span data-start="48.08" data-end="53">loaded, parsed, compiled, and executed by the JavaScript engine.</span> <span data-start="53.06" data-end="56.98">How can web developers make this faster?</span> <span data-start="56.98" data-end="62.53">One approach is to use server-side rendering: you serve plain HTML that already contains</span> <span data-start="62.53" data-end="69.5">the processed form of the data, and therefore no JavaScript is required for the initial load of your app.</span> <span data-start="69.5" data-end="73.93">This way, you can avoid the need for the large JavaScript objects entirely.</span> <span data-start="73.93" data-end="77.24">But, what if you can’t use server-side rendering?</span> <span data-start="77.24" data-end="79.96">Is there anything else we can do to improve performance?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="79.96" data-end="81.96">It depends.</span> <span data-start="81.96" data-end="87.25">In many cases, this critical data doesn’t contain anything that cannot be unambiguously</span> <span data-start="87.25" data-end="94.63">represented in JSON: there’s no Date objects, no BigInts, no Maps, no Sets, and so on.</span> <span data-start="94.63" data-end="99.46">And in those cases, instead of having an object literal in the JavaScript source code, you</span> <span data-start="99.46" data-end="104.64">can serialize the object as JSON, turn it into a JavaScript string literal, and then pass</span> <span data-start="104.64" data-end="107.86">that to the built-in JSON.parse function.</span> <span data-start="107.86" data-end="111.62">This technique produces an equivalent object.</span> <span data-start="111.62" data-end="115.62">Now which of these two techniques do you think is faster?</span> <span data-start="115.62" data-end="119.88">As it turns out, the JSON approach is significantly faster!</span> <span data-start="119.88" data-end="124.95">This is a little surprising and counter-intuitive: the JavaScript object literal feels like the</span> <span data-start="124.95" data-end="130.88">more direct approach, whereas JSON.parse feels like an additional layer of indirection.</span> <span data-start="130.88" data-end="135.69">Yet somehow, JSON.parse is much faster. Why is that?</span> <span data-start="135.69" data-end="140.2">Part of the reason is that for JavaScript engines, the JSON example is super simple</span> <span data-start="140.2" data-end="143.78">to scan and parse.</span> <span data-start="143.78" data-end="148.441">To the JavaScript parser, this code snippet is little more than a CallExpression with</span> <span data-start="148.441" data-end="150.05">a single argument.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="150.05" data-end="153.98">The large blob of data is just a single StringLiteral token!</span> <span data-start="153.98" data-end="158.7">On the other hand, the equivalent object literal consists of many more tokens:</span> <span data-start="159.7" data-end="163.48">each property name is an Identifier token or a string-like literal,</span> <span data-start="164.49" data-end="169.9">and in this case each of the values is a NumericLiteral, but they could really be anything.</span> <span data-start="169.9" data-end="177.1">They could be nested objects or arrays, with properties and values of their own, in which case there’s even more tokens.</span> <span data-start="177.1" data-end="182.2">So compared to the JSON.parse example, the JavaScript parser needs to work harder</span> <span data-start="182.2" data-end="185.23">just to tokenize this script correctly.</span> <span data-start="185.23" data-end="190.1">Another reason why JavaScript object literals are harder to scan and parse is because</span> <span data-start="190.1" data-end="193.239">you don’t know ahead of time that they’re object literals!</span> <span data-start="193.239" data-end="195.25">Let’s unpack that a little bit.</span> <span data-start="195.25" data-end="201.72">Pretend you’re a parser for a minute, and you’re looking at source code character by character.</span> <span data-start="201.72" data-end="206.6">In JSON, if you see an opening brace, there’s only two possible options:</span> <span data-start="206.62" data-end="211.3">either this is the start of an object, or this is invalid JSON.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="211.3" data-end="213.3">Two options. That’s it.</span> <span data-start="214.26" data-end="217.8">In JavaScript however, there’s many more possibilities.</span> <span data-start="217.819" data-end="223.8">An opening brace could be the start of an object literal, but it could also be a number of other things!</span> <span data-start="223.85" data-end="225.91">Let’s walk through some examples.</span> <span data-start="225.91" data-end="229.96">Here, we have an opening brace on the second line.</span> <span data-start="229.96" data-end="233.64">What do you think, is this an object literal or not?</span> <span data-start="233.64" data-end="236.129">And what does the x on the second line refer to?</span> <span data-start="236.129" data-end="241.3">Does it refer to the binding on the first line, or is it something else?</span> <span data-start="241.3" data-end="246.8">Turns out, it’s not even possible to answer these questions without looking at the rest of the code.</span> <span data-start="246.8" data-end="251.21">In this case, the second line creates an object literal.</span> <span data-start="251.21" data-end="254.2">x refers to the binding on the first line.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="254.2" data-end="261.489">But in this case, it’s an object destructuring, and the x doesn’t refer to the first line at all.</span> <span data-start="261.489" data-end="266.059">And then there’s this scenario, where the second line contains an arrow function with</span> <span data-start="266.059" data-end="269.069">a destructuring parameter named x.</span> <span data-start="269.069" data-end="273.139">In that case, the x also does not refer to the first line.</span> <span data-start="273.139" data-end="279.7">The point I’m trying to make here is that parsing JavaScript is tricky because its grammar is context-sensitive.</span> <span data-start="279.7" data-end="284.919">JSON doesn’t have that problem, and so parsing JSON is much simpler.</span> <span data-start="284.919" data-end="293.9">And that’s why, especially for large objects, it’s faster to use JSON.parse than to use a JavaScript object literal.</span> <span data-start="293.919" data-end="295.789">At this point you’re probably wondering…</span> <span data-start="295.789" data-end="298">how much faster is it exactly?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="298" data-end="305.5">We measured this for an 8-MB payload on cold loads (with no caching) and found that in V8 and Chrome,</span> <span data-start="305.5" data-end="310.849">the JSON.parse technique is 1.7 times as fast as the object literal.</span> <span data-start="310.849" data-end="315.19">And the speed-up applies to other JavaScript engines and browsers as well!</span> <span data-start="315.19" data-end="322.059">In Safari and JavaScriptCore, the difference is even greater: there, JSON.parse is twice as fast!</span> <span data-start="322.059" data-end="327.36">Ok, you might say, that’s just a synthetic benchmark with a very large payload.</span> <span data-start="327.36" data-end="330.139">How does this affect real-world web apps?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="330.139" data-end="335.432">Well, Henrik Joreteg applied this optimization to a Redux app he was working on,</span> <span data-start="335.432" data-end="338">and published a case study about the results.</span> <span data-start="338" data-end="344.43">There was an 18% improvement in Time to Interactive, and the app’s Lighthouse performance score</span> <span data-start="344.43" data-end="346.96">went up 8 points as well.</span> <span data-start="346.96" data-end="350.44">That’s not bad for applying a single optimization!</span> <span data-start="350.44" data-end="353.219">How can you start making use of this optimization?</span> <span data-start="353.219" data-end="356.539">I wouldn’t recommend doing this manually.</span> <span data-start="356.539" data-end="361.36">In source code, you’d still want to use object literals since they’re more readable.</span> <span data-start="361.36" data-end="367.599">Instead, tooling can help you automatically transform large object literals into JSON.parse,</span> <span data-start="367.599" data-end="370.229">as a build-time optimization.</span> <span data-start="370.229" data-end="376.34">webpack already applies the JSON.parse technique if your code base uses JSON modules.</span> <span data-start="376.34" data-end="381.28">There’s also a Babel plugin that can apply the transformation on other code.</span> <span data-start="381.28" data-end="386.42">For more JavaScript performance tips, check out “The Cost of JavaScript” on the V8 blog.</span> <span data-start="387.06" data-end="389.5">And that’s it — thanks for watching, everyone!</span> </p>
