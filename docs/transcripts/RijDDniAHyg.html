<p><span data-start="23.38" data-end="24.33">And this is all great.</span> <span data-start="24.33" data-end="26.463">This is a common practice, and it's so great</span> <span data-start="26.463" data-end="28.38">that you are thinking about responsive design.</span> <span data-start="28.38" data-end="32.49">But many other users might be interacting with your website</span> <span data-start="32.49" data-end="35.55">using something other than mouse and tap.</span> <span data-start="35.55" data-end="38.82">For example, other users might be accessing your website</span> <span data-start="38.82" data-end="42.3">only using keyboard or other assistive technology,</span> <span data-start="42.3" data-end="44.73">or other users might be accessing your website</span> <span data-start="44.73" data-end="47.13">using screen readers and listening</span> <span data-start="47.13" data-end="48.84">to what's on the screen.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="48.84" data-end="51.9">Other case, user may be accessing your website</span> <span data-start="51.9" data-end="54.33">using feature phone with tiny screen</span> <span data-start="54.33" data-end="57.39">or on the smart TV using giant screen</span> <span data-start="57.39" data-end="60.33">and using a remote controller as a mouse.</span> <span data-start="60.33" data-end="62.41">So whenever we build a web application,</span> <span data-start="62.41" data-end="64.83">we need to think about those different devices</span> <span data-start="64.83" data-end="67.29">and all of the users using those device</span> <span data-start="67.29" data-end="70.17">and making sure that nobody gets left behind.</span> <span data-start="70.17" data-end="74.07">Let's think about this small web application that has a menu.</span> <span data-start="74.07" data-end="75.27">You click on it.</span> <span data-start="75.27" data-end="79.11">Some new content load in, and then you need to click Next.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="79.11" data-end="80.49">This seems very simple.</span> <span data-start="80.49" data-end="82.08">It's only two click.</span> <span data-start="82.08" data-end="86.74">But for users using keyboard, this might be different,</span> <span data-start="86.74" data-end="88.98">so for the same website, user might</span> <span data-start="88.98" data-end="92.61">have to tap the key many times to select a menu.</span> <span data-start="92.61" data-end="94.6">And then once the page is loaded,</span> <span data-start="94.6" data-end="97.23">they have to click many, many, many, many, many more</span> <span data-start="97.23" data-end="100.96">times on the keyboard to get to the Next button,</span> <span data-start="100.96" data-end="102.27">and this is not great.</span> <span data-start="102.27" data-end="105">So in this case, we, as a web developer,</span> <span data-start="105" data-end="108.03">needs to do a little bit of focus management.</span> <span data-start="108.03" data-end="112.13">See the browser, if they found a focusable element, like button,</span> <span data-start="112.13" data-end="114.21">then it focus on it.</span> <span data-start="114.21" data-end="117.57">But as a web developer, we can add an attribute called</span> <span data-start="117.57" data-end="120.6">tabindex and set the value to minus 1</span> <span data-start="120.6" data-end="124.44">to tell the browser that this element is not focusable.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="124.44" data-end="126.96">Using this attribute, we can do a technique</span> <span data-start="126.96" data-end="129.09">called [INAUDIBLE] tabindex.</span> <span data-start="129.09" data-end="131.95">So let's say the website have a collection of items</span> <span data-start="131.95" data-end="133.2">that is selectable.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="133.2" data-end="136.77">You put tabindex of 0 to only one item</span> <span data-start="136.77" data-end="139.02">and set everything else to minus 1.</span> <span data-start="139.02" data-end="141.84">In this way, there's only one item</span> <span data-start="141.84" data-end="144.93">that is selectable in the collection, and if the user â€” </span> <span data-start="144.93" data-end="148.35">keyboard user wants to move away from the collection,</span> <span data-start="148.35" data-end="152.43">they just need to tap Tab key and then go to the Next button</span> <span data-start="152.43" data-end="153.48">easily.</span> <span data-start="153.48" data-end="156.27">If they want to interact with the collection,</span> <span data-start="156.27" data-end="158.79">then they can use Up and Down arrow keys</span> <span data-start="158.79" data-end="160.83">to navigate those collection.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="160.83" data-end="163.41">In this case, we add a little bit of JavaScript</span> <span data-start="163.41" data-end="168.24">to listen to those key bits and move the tabindex of 0</span> <span data-start="168.24" data-end="171.66">to where the focus should be and move the focus.</span> <span data-start="171.66" data-end="175.47">And speaking of focus, focus ring or focus highlight</span> <span data-start="175.47" data-end="176.79">is really important.</span> <span data-start="176.79" data-end="179.07">In many case, this is the only way user</span> <span data-start="179.07" data-end="182.55">know which element has a focus and which one get clicked</span> <span data-start="182.55" data-end="184.08">when they hit Enter.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="184.08" data-end="185.73">And this one comes in handy, too,</span> <span data-start="185.73" data-end="188.97">when user is accessing your website using tiny screen,</span> <span data-start="188.97" data-end="190.74">like feature phone.</span> <span data-start="190.74" data-end="195.57">Of course, if you prefer the mouse and touch user to not see</span> <span data-start="195.57" data-end="199.35">those highlight, you can look into Focus Visible attribute</span> <span data-start="199.35" data-end="201.49">on the CSS to control those.</span> <span data-start="201.49" data-end="204.39">And speaking of focus, we sometimes</span> <span data-start="204.39" data-end="207.84">need to proactively manage the focus, too.</span> <span data-start="207.84" data-end="212.07">Here's a common user interaction we see on the internet today.</span> <span data-start="212.07" data-end="216.27">You click on the hamburger icon, and then the menu slide up.</span> <span data-start="216.27" data-end="219.03">But where did the highlight go?</span> <span data-start="219.03" data-end="223.14">Well, highlight is still trapped in the background,</span> <span data-start="223.14" data-end="227.7">so even though user opened the menu to interact with the menu,</span> <span data-start="227.7" data-end="230.53">they cannot get to the menu item.</span> <span data-start="230.53" data-end="233.91">In this case, you need to move the focus to the menu,</span> <span data-start="233.91" data-end="236.61">so click on the hamburger icon.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="236.61" data-end="237.99">Menu shows up.</span> <span data-start="237.99" data-end="242.1">You need to move the focus into the button inside of the menu.</span> <span data-start="242.1" data-end="245.94">And don't forget, if user click on it and close the menu,</span> <span data-start="245.94" data-end="249.09">then focus should go back to the previous element that</span> <span data-start="249.09" data-end="250.56">had a focus.</span> <span data-start="250.56" data-end="253.11">If you want to know how we use these techniques</span> <span data-start="253.11" data-end="256.05">in the [INAUDIBLE] web application called Proxx,</span> <span data-start="256.05" data-end="258.42">you should check out my talk from Google I/O</span> <span data-start="258.42" data-end="261.209">called "Building Fast and Smooth Web Apps."</span> <span data-start="261.209" data-end="262.26">Thanks for watching.</span> <span data-start="262.26" data-end="265.31">[MUSIC PLAYING]</span> </p>
