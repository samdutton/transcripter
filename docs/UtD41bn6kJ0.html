<p><span data-start="10.374" data-end="11.79">And I don't think my parents could</span> <span data-start="11.79" data-end="13.92">have known when they named me all those years ago</span> <span data-start="13.92" data-end="16.47">that my hair would prematurely match my name</span> <span data-start="16.47" data-end="18.58">or that I would be a valid CSS color.</span> <span data-start="18.58" data-end="22.18">So I give them a lot of credit.</span> <span data-start="22.18" data-end="24.83">So I'm the engineering manager for the Polymer Project</span> <span data-start="24.83" data-end="25.5">at Chrome.</span> <span data-start="25.5" data-end="28.53">And my team focuses mainly on web components, and libraries,</span> <span data-start="28.53" data-end="30.147">and tools to help you use them.</span> <span data-start="30.147" data-end="31.98">But we're involved in some other stuff, too.</span> <span data-start="31.98" data-end="35.748">And today I'm here to talk about something a little different.</span> <span data-start="39.849" data-end="42.14">Or maybe we'll just stand here, and look at my picture.</span> <span data-start="42.14" data-end="43.71">[CHUCKLES]</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="43.71" data-end="46.62">So shockingly, we're going to be talking about performance.</span> <span data-start="46.62" data-end="48.36">As you may have noticed, we're a wee bit</span> <span data-start="48.36" data-end="50.71">obsessed with that topic.</span> <span data-start="50.71" data-end="54.27">And by now, you've already heard about speed tooling, and best</span> <span data-start="54.27" data-end="56.43">practices for doing everything faster,</span> <span data-start="56.43" data-end="60.695">from loading, to rendering, to responding to user input.</span> <span data-start="60.695" data-end="62.07">But for the next half hour, we're</span> <span data-start="62.07" data-end="65.28">going to drill in on something a little more specific.</span> <span data-start="65.28" data-end="68.22">And that's a proven pattern for improving performance that we'd</span> <span data-start="68.22" data-end="71.01">like to see more of on the web.</span> <span data-start="71.01" data-end="74.22">[INAUDIBLE] mentioned in yesterday's keynote</span> <span data-start="74.22" data-end="76.35">that today's web platform is really</span> <span data-start="76.35" data-end="78.18">a high-performance machine.</span> <span data-start="78.18" data-end="80.61">And it's way faster in almost every way than it</span> <span data-start="80.61" data-end="83.26">was even a few years ago.</span> <span data-start="83.26" data-end="86.29">But there are still some surefire ways to slow it down.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="86.29" data-end="90.11">And one of those ways is just trying to render too much.</span> <span data-start="90.11" data-end="91.91">Especially on low-end mobile devices,</span> <span data-start="91.91" data-end="93.82">you can bring performance to a crawl</span> <span data-start="93.82" data-end="96.21">by piling on too much DOM.</span> <span data-start="96.21" data-end="99.52">And sadly, there are key parts of the rendering process,</span> <span data-start="99.52" data-end="102.669">like styling and layout, that just take longer the more nodes</span> <span data-start="102.669" data-end="103.585">you have in your page.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="106.53" data-end="109.07">So for a certain class of performance problems,</span> <span data-start="109.07" data-end="111.53">the best thing you can do to speed things up</span> <span data-start="111.53" data-end="113.48">is to lighten your load, minimize</span> <span data-start="113.48" data-end="116.67">the number of DOM nodes you have on the page at any given time.</span> <span data-start="116.67" data-end="118.75">And there are various ways to do this, of course.</span> <span data-start="118.75" data-end="120.5">But one of the simplest and most effective</span> <span data-start="120.5" data-end="125.34">is to adopt a pattern called virtual scrolling.</span> <span data-start="125.34" data-end="128.28">So for the last several months, a couple of members of my team</span> <span data-start="128.28" data-end="130.47">have teamed up with some of our Chrome colleagues</span> <span data-start="130.47" data-end="133.38">and some other folks inside and outside of Google</span> <span data-start="133.38" data-end="135.15">to explore what it might look like to add</span> <span data-start="135.15" data-end="139.65">first-class virtual scrolling support to the web platform.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="139.65" data-end="142.72">Today I'd like to share what we've come up with so far.</span> <span data-start="142.72" data-end="144.72">It's early, but we're pretty excited about where</span> <span data-start="144.72" data-end="145.636">the project is headed.</span> <span data-start="147.979" data-end="149.52">We'll start with a quick introduction</span> <span data-start="149.52" data-end="151.89">to what virtual scrolling is and how it's currently</span> <span data-start="151.89" data-end="155.114">being used on and off the web.</span> <span data-start="155.114" data-end="157.28">And then we'll take a closer look at the performance</span> <span data-start="157.28" data-end="159.95">problems we're trying to addressing, seeing firsthand</span> <span data-start="159.95" data-end="164.88">how too much DOM can impact the responsiveness of your pages.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="164.88" data-end="169.16">Next, we'll talk briefly about the approach we're taking,</span> <span data-start="169.16" data-end="172.729">and we'll show you what we've come up with so far.</span> <span data-start="172.729" data-end="174.77">And then finally, we'll look ahead to what's next</span> <span data-start="174.77" data-end="178.957">and how you can get involved if you're interested.</span> <span data-start="178.957" data-end="180.54">So without further ado, let's see what</span> <span data-start="180.54" data-end="182.58">virtual scrolling is all about.</span> <span data-start="182.58" data-end="184.53">For the sake of comparison, first we'll</span> <span data-start="184.53" data-end="186.03">look at ordinary scrolling.</span> <span data-start="186.03" data-end="188.01">So the blue box here is our viewport.</span> <span data-start="188.01" data-end="190.29">And as you can see, as we scroll,</span> <span data-start="190.29" data-end="192.9">the document moves behind the viewport revealing content</span> <span data-start="192.9" data-end="194.16">further up or down.</span> <span data-start="194.16" data-end="197.01">But notice that all the content was present from the start.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="197.01" data-end="200.9">The only thing that changes is what we see.</span> <span data-start="200.9" data-end="203.87">Now here's the same page in a virtual scroller.</span> <span data-start="203.87" data-end="207.08">As you'll see, only part of the content exists on the document.</span> <span data-start="207.08" data-end="210.44">As we scroll, nodes are dynamically added and removed</span> <span data-start="210.44" data-end="212.92">keeping just enough to fill the viewport.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="212.92" data-end="214.73">Nodes is an obvious one at load times,</span> <span data-start="214.73" data-end="217.28">since we only need to render one screenfull.</span> <span data-start="217.28" data-end="219.41">But as we'll see, virtual scrolling actually</span> <span data-start="219.41" data-end="221.15">also improves performance in other ways</span> <span data-start="221.15" data-end="222.358">that might not be as obvious.</span> <span data-start="225.34" data-end="228.78">So when does it make sense to use virtual scrolling?</span> <span data-start="228.78" data-end="230.52">It's clearly a natural fit for anytime</span> <span data-start="230.52" data-end="232.38">you need to display a lot of data</span> <span data-start="232.38" data-end="234.48">in a list or table form —  for example,</span> <span data-start="234.48" data-end="237.28">like this address book.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="237.28" data-end="240.17">And also, it's an obvious call for content</span> <span data-start="240.17" data-end="243.89">feeds in cases like social media or messaging.</span> <span data-start="246.669" data-end="249.21">But feeds have started showing up in less traditional places,</span> <span data-start="249.21" data-end="249.72">too.</span> <span data-start="249.72" data-end="251.94">So some publishers have started stitching together</span> <span data-start="251.94" data-end="254.34">articles in a way that takes advantage</span> <span data-start="254.34" data-end="256.92">of the low friction of scrolling.</span> <span data-start="256.92" data-end="259.576">And this may not look like your garden-variety infinite list.</span> <span data-start="259.576" data-end="261.45">But nonetheless, it's absolutely a case where</span> <span data-start="261.45" data-end="264.44">virtual scrolling can help.</span> <span data-start="264.44" data-end="266.21">And for that matter, we actually think</span> <span data-start="266.21" data-end="267.83">there's a strong argument to be made</span> <span data-start="267.83" data-end="271.85">for looking at virtual scrolling in cases beyond lists</span> <span data-start="271.85" data-end="273.44">and feeds.</span> <span data-start="273.44" data-end="275">A single piece of long-form content,</span> <span data-start="275" data-end="277.04">like this Wikipedia article, might easily</span> <span data-start="277.04" data-end="279.37">contain tens of thousands of nodes.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="279.37" data-end="281.36">And the same techniques that we use for lists</span> <span data-start="281.36" data-end="283.48">can also help us keep the weight of documents</span> <span data-start="283.48" data-end="284.48">like this under control.</span> <span data-start="287.81" data-end="290.36">So virtual scrolling isn't a new idea, of course.</span> <span data-start="290.36" data-end="293.15">It's widely used on native mobile platforms.</span> <span data-start="293.15" data-end="296.24">In fact, both iOS and Android put virtualized views</span> <span data-start="296.24" data-end="298.514">front and center in their SDKs, making</span> <span data-start="298.514" data-end="299.93">this one of the first concepts you</span> <span data-start="299.93" data-end="303.67">learn as a new developer on one of those platforms.</span> <span data-start="303.67" data-end="306.05">And this is a big part of why native mobile apps tend</span> <span data-start="306.05" data-end="307.85">to feel fast.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="307.85" data-end="310.37">A basic native view is actually heavier than the equivalent</span> <span data-start="310.37" data-end="311.36">chunk of DOM.</span> <span data-start="311.36" data-end="314.03">But the mainstream use of virtual scrolling</span> <span data-start="314.03" data-end="316.58">on platforms like these helps keep performance line.</span> <span data-start="319.627" data-end="321.46">Now you might be thinking, virtual scrolling</span> <span data-start="321.46" data-end="322.99">isn't new to the web, either.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="322.99" data-end="324.5">And you'd be right.</span> <span data-start="324.5" data-end="327.31">There are popular and effective virtual scrolling solutions</span> <span data-start="327.31" data-end="329.72">for all the top frameworks, including,</span> <span data-start="329.72" data-end="332.74">among others, react-virtualized, and its younger sibling</span> <span data-start="332.74" data-end="336.28">react-window, the virtual-scroll-viewport</span> <span data-start="336.28" data-end="340.385">in the Angular Material CDK, and the view-virtual-scroller</span> <span data-start="340.385" data-end="340.885">library.</span> <span data-start="344.266" data-end="345.64">But these solutions are currently</span> <span data-start="345.64" data-end="348.8">getting by without much help from the web platform.</span> <span data-start="348.8" data-end="351.97">So in the age-old tradition of paving cow paths,</span> <span data-start="351.97" data-end="353.56">we asked ourselves, what might it</span> <span data-start="353.56" data-end="356.68">look like for the web to offer first-class virtual scrolling</span> <span data-start="356.68" data-end="357.28">support?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="357.28" data-end="359.6">How could we make things better?</span> <span data-start="359.6" data-end="362.97">And we came up with a few ideas.</span> <span data-start="362.97" data-end="365.54">First, virtualization generally means</span> <span data-start="365.54" data-end="368.219">you can't link to locations within the same document</span> <span data-start="368.219" data-end="370.76">since the browser can't scroll to a node that's not currently</span> <span data-start="370.76" data-end="371.78">on the DOM.</span> <span data-start="371.78" data-end="374.45">Now, this may not be an issue for many use cases.</span> <span data-start="374.45" data-end="377.24">You don't see a lot of links between address book entries,</span> <span data-start="377.24" data-end="378.5">for example.</span> <span data-start="378.5" data-end="380.412">But in other cases, it is a big deal,</span> <span data-start="380.412" data-end="382.37">and it breaks a fundamental feature of the web.</span> <span data-start="385.34" data-end="387.585">And there's a similar problem with the browsers Find</span> <span data-start="387.585" data-end="389.756">in Page feature, which only sees text</span> <span data-start="389.756" data-end="390.88">if it's present in the DOM.</span> <span data-start="393.42" data-end="395.55">And then there's search friendliness.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="395.55" data-end="398.5">Since virtualized content is added on the fly,</span> <span data-start="398.5" data-end="401.777">it's not generally visible to search engine crawlers.</span> <span data-start="401.777" data-end="403.86">And again, this isn't relevant for every use case.</span> <span data-start="403.86" data-end="405.36">But we'd love to get the performance</span> <span data-start="405.36" data-end="407.61">benefits of virtual scrolling without sacrificing</span> <span data-start="407.61" data-end="411.09">indexability.</span> <span data-start="411.09" data-end="412.89">Finally, and maybe most importantly,</span> <span data-start="412.89" data-end="414.42">we'd like to see if we can greatly</span> <span data-start="414.42" data-end="416.19">increase the amount of virtualization that</span> <span data-start="416.19" data-end="419.065">happens on the web by adding platform-level support.</span> <span data-start="419.065" data-end="421.44">While you could do it today, virtual scrolling on the web</span> <span data-start="421.44" data-end="423.15">is basically a fringe feature.</span> <span data-start="423.15" data-end="424.819">You have to discover you need it,</span> <span data-start="424.819" data-end="427.11">and then you have to jump through some hoops to get it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="427.11" data-end="428.4">We'd like to put it front and center — </span> <span data-start="428.4" data-end="429.87">the way it is in mobile SDKs — </span> <span data-start="429.87" data-end="432.12">making it easier to discover and easier to use.</span> <span data-start="437.78" data-end="440.78">OK, so we've talked about what virtual scrolling is</span> <span data-start="440.78" data-end="443.43">and why we're interested in adding it to the web platform.</span> <span data-start="443.43" data-end="445.4">But to really understand the nature of the performance</span> <span data-start="445.4" data-end="446.96">problems we're trying to solve, it'll</span> <span data-start="446.96" data-end="448.21">help to look at some examples.</span> <span data-start="451.52" data-end="453.98">Since problems are the worst on low-end devices,</span> <span data-start="453.98" data-end="457.56">we'll use a typical Android Go phone for this exercise.</span> <span data-start="457.56" data-end="460.46">So I actually recorded a bunch of real-world interactions</span> <span data-start="460.46" data-end="461.272">for this talk.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="461.272" data-end="463.73">But I wasn't super happy with the quality of the recording.</span> <span data-start="463.73" data-end="467.78">So I ended up creating dramatic reenactments in Dev Tools</span> <span data-start="467.78" data-end="470.05">with CPU throttling turned on.</span> <span data-start="470.05" data-end="471.8">But what you'll see here is representative</span> <span data-start="471.8" data-end="473.3">of the performance on a real device.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="473.3" data-end="475.532">And I'd be happy to show you on the device itself</span> <span data-start="475.532" data-end="476.99">if you come find me after the talk.</span> <span data-start="482.05" data-end="485.47">OK, so first, we'll look at how the size of the document</span> <span data-start="485.47" data-end="487.39">impacts rendering and what that means</span> <span data-start="487.39" data-end="490.095">for responding to user interactions and content</span> <span data-start="490.095" data-end="490.595">updates.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="493.34" data-end="495.48">So I created a simple example to demonstrate.</span> <span data-start="495.48" data-end="498.04">It's a bit contrived, but it exercises the browser engine</span> <span data-start="498.04" data-end="500.65">in the same way as the real pages do.</span> <span data-start="500.65" data-end="503.33">So this mocked-up content feed has just five items in it.</span> <span data-start="503.33" data-end="504.94">And it performs pretty well.</span> <span data-start="504.94" data-end="508.3">You'll see it has advanced features like a dark mode</span> <span data-start="508.3" data-end="510.7">and a compact layout mode.</span> <span data-start="510.7" data-end="513.34">And these are all made just using standard CSS techniques</span> <span data-start="513.34" data-end="515.231">changing classes.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="515.231" data-end="516.98">And then lastly, we have this slider here,</span> <span data-start="516.98" data-end="520.6">which lets us increase or decrease the size of the items</span> <span data-start="520.6" data-end="523">by changing the base font size in the document, which</span> <span data-start="523" data-end="525.7">is a technique that many of you have probably used.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="525.7" data-end="528.34">And layouts or the items themselves</span> <span data-start="528.34" data-end="532.709">are based on [INAUDIBLE] so that the whole thing scales.</span> <span data-start="532.709" data-end="534.5">As you can see, this performed pretty well.</span> <span data-start="534.5" data-end="537.235">But again, it's only five items.</span> <span data-start="537.235" data-end="538.86">So let's see what happens if we bump up</span> <span data-start="538.86" data-end="540.366">to 50 items on our feed.</span> <span data-start="540.366" data-end="542.49">So I'm scrolling here to show there's more content.</span> <span data-start="542.49" data-end="544.48">But don't focus on the scrolling performance.</span> <span data-start="544.48" data-end="545.896">We'll talk about that in a minute.</span> <span data-start="545.896" data-end="548.25">For now, we want to focus on the other interactions.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="548.25" data-end="550.02">You'll notice I added a jank indicator.</span> <span data-start="550.02" data-end="554.28">So the screen flashes red when rendering gets slow.</span> <span data-start="554.28" data-end="556.41">And we're not too bad here at 50 items</span> <span data-start="556.41" data-end="558.81">still, although there are noticeable delays for the mode</span> <span data-start="558.81" data-end="559.5">switches.</span> <span data-start="559.5" data-end="561.72">And then you'll see there's some sluggishness</span> <span data-start="561.72" data-end="563.04">as we start moving the slider.</span> <span data-start="571.61" data-end="573.62">But where we really start feeling the pain</span> <span data-start="573.62" data-end="576.29">is when we get up to 500 times or more.</span> <span data-start="576.29" data-end="578">So the lagginess in this example is</span> <span data-start="578" data-end="581.57">going to be impossible to miss.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="581.57" data-end="583.02">So you'll notice that, when we go</span> <span data-start="583.02" data-end="586.64">to dark mode or compact mode, there's a very noticeable lag.</span> <span data-start="589.79" data-end="593.54">And the slider is going to be virtually unusable,</span> <span data-start="593.54" data-end="594.68">it's so slow to update.</span> <span data-start="597.96" data-end="599.46">If anything, it actually feels worse</span> <span data-start="599.46" data-end="600.626">on the real phone than this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="603.53" data-end="605.33">So again, this example is a bit contrived.</span> <span data-start="605.33" data-end="607.41">You may not do exactly this on your page.</span> <span data-start="607.41" data-end="609.825">But the effects it illustrates are very real.</span> <span data-start="609.825" data-end="613.29">When you're rendering any content on your page,</span> <span data-start="613.29" data-end="616.34">whether it's in response to user interactions or changing data,</span> <span data-start="616.34" data-end="619.22">it gets much slower as your document gets bigger.</span> <span data-start="619.22" data-end="621.77">And on devices like this, it can kill your page.</span> <span data-start="625.91" data-end="629.08">So let's jump ahead of it, and see how much</span> <span data-start="629.08" data-end="630.86">virtual scrolling might help.</span> <span data-start="630.86" data-end="632.5">So this is exactly the same page with</span> <span data-start="632.5" data-end="634.66">our work-in-progress virtual scroller swapped</span> <span data-start="634.66" data-end="636.15">in for the scrolling region.</span> <span data-start="636.15" data-end="638.14">And we've bumped all the way up to 5,000 items.</span> <span data-start="638.14" data-end="639.931">But of course, only a small effect fraction</span> <span data-start="639.931" data-end="642.421">are actually in the document at any given time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="642.421" data-end="644.17">And as you can see, we're pretty much back</span> <span data-start="644.17" data-end="646.84">to the same performance we had in our original five-item list.</span> <span data-start="646.84" data-end="651.74">And this is essentially how it feels on the phone, as well.</span> <span data-start="651.74" data-end="654.94">And remember, this is a very low-powered Android Go device.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="660.75" data-end="664.17">Next, let's see how virtualizing might help us that load time.</span> <span data-start="664.17" data-end="666.36">So a quick caveat about this — </span> <span data-start="666.36" data-end="668.52">load time performance, how quickly we get something</span> <span data-start="668.52" data-end="670.8">on screen, how quickly we make it interactive,</span> <span data-start="670.8" data-end="672.24">depends on a lot of factors.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="672.24" data-end="675.57">And virtual scrolling doesn't directly impact many of them.</span> <span data-start="675.57" data-end="678.87">But to the extent that styling and layout are slowing things</span> <span data-start="678.87" data-end="681.89">down at load time, virtual scrolling can definitely help.</span> <span data-start="684.55" data-end="687.01">So being the big web nerds that we are,</span> <span data-start="687.01" data-end="690.53">we'll use the single-page HTML spec doc as an example.</span> <span data-start="690.53" data-end="692.53">So this thing is massive, somewhere on the order</span> <span data-start="692.53" data-end="694.6">of a million words, I'm told.</span> <span data-start="694.6" data-end="696.67">And it's notoriously slow to load.</span> <span data-start="696.67" data-end="699.73">So on my Android Go device, with a "good but not great"</span> <span data-start="699.73" data-end="702.85">network connection —  because I'd gone over my data allowance</span> <span data-start="702.85" data-end="704.65">for the month — </span> <span data-start="704.65" data-end="709.62">it took about seven seconds to get something on screen.</span> <span data-start="709.62" data-end="714.05">So for comparison, we've built a virtual scrolling</span> <span data-start="714.05" data-end="716.81">version of this page out of duct tape and baling wire.</span> <span data-start="716.81" data-end="719.99">Basically, it loads the original dock into a hidden iframe.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="719.99" data-end="721.85">And then it populates the virtual scroller</span> <span data-start="721.85" data-end="723.706">as the nodes stream into the iframe.</span> <span data-start="723.706" data-end="725.58">And you wouldn't build a real thing this way.</span> <span data-start="725.58" data-end="726.996">But it's an interesting test case.</span> <span data-start="726.996" data-end="728.97">And it illustrates the impact.</span> <span data-start="728.97" data-end="732.23">So as this visualization shows, we got something on screen</span> <span data-start="732.23" data-end="733.16">much faster — </span> <span data-start="733.16" data-end="735.47">just over three seconds instead of seven — </span> <span data-start="735.47" data-end="738.25">and it actually gets even better from there.</span> <span data-start="738.25" data-end="741.59">The original version on this Android Go phone</span> <span data-start="741.59" data-end="745.34">was suffering from scroll jank for well over a minute</span> <span data-start="745.34" data-end="746.69">after I started loading it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="746.69" data-end="749.75">Whereas, the virtual scrolling version is usable right away.</span> <span data-start="749.75" data-end="752.42">As you scroll, there's occasionally</span> <span data-start="752.42" data-end="754.55">a delay as it updates.</span> <span data-start="754.55" data-end="757.82">But unlike on the original version,</span> <span data-start="757.82" data-end="759.721">you're never sitting and waiting for seconds</span> <span data-start="759.721" data-end="760.97">while the screen is locked up.</span> <span data-start="766.43" data-end="768.38">OK, so before we move on from performance,</span> <span data-start="768.38" data-end="770.45">one quick word about scrolling performance — </span> <span data-start="770.45" data-end="772.85">because it seems a little weird not to talk about that</span> <span data-start="772.85" data-end="775.64">in a talk about scrolling.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="775.64" data-end="778.43">So because scrolling is driven by the GPU,</span> <span data-start="778.43" data-end="780.862">even on our low-end Android Go device,</span> <span data-start="780.862" data-end="782.57">you actually get pretty decent scrolling.</span> <span data-start="782.57" data-end="784.22">It scrolls at a reliably high frame</span> <span data-start="784.22" data-end="786.56">rate that actually looks really good at normal scrolling</span> <span data-start="786.56" data-end="787.67">speeds.</span> <span data-start="787.67" data-end="790.84">But when you scroll quickly, something funny happens.</span> <span data-start="790.84" data-end="793.07">The screen blanks out, goes completely white</span> <span data-start="793.07" data-end="796.01">for long periods of time while the rendering pipeline</span> <span data-start="796.01" data-end="796.61">catches up.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="796.61" data-end="799.04">And this actually gets worse as the size of the document</span> <span data-start="799.04" data-end="800.6">increases, just like the other performance</span> <span data-start="800.6" data-end="801.891">problems we've been looking at.</span> <span data-start="804.33" data-end="808.1">So I did salvage one of my original on-device recordings.</span> <span data-start="808.1" data-end="810.212">And we'll look at it here.</span> <span data-start="810.212" data-end="811.67">Our virtual scroller, it turns out,</span> <span data-start="811.67" data-end="814.19">significantly reduced the blanking problem.</span> <span data-start="814.19" data-end="815.719">It happens much less frequently.</span> <span data-start="815.719" data-end="817.26">And when it does happen, the renderer</span> <span data-start="817.26" data-end="819.98">catches up much more quickly.</span> <span data-start="819.98" data-end="822.77">The trade off is that scrolling is mildly but noticeably less</span> <span data-start="822.77" data-end="823.88">smooth overall.</span> <span data-start="823.88" data-end="827.03">As you would expect, doing JavaScript layout</span> <span data-start="827.03" data-end="829.52">on a CPU-challenged device like this</span> <span data-start="829.52" data-end="831.51">does impact the frame rate.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="831.51" data-end="833.51">But as you can see from the video,</span> <span data-start="833.51" data-end="836.646">it's a very good experience nonetheless, even</span> <span data-start="836.646" data-end="837.77">on this low-powered device.</span> <span data-start="842.04" data-end="843.19">OK.</span> <span data-start="843.19" data-end="844.96">So we know what virtual scrolling is.</span> <span data-start="844.96" data-end="846.97">We know why we want to add it to the platform.</span> <span data-start="846.97" data-end="850.78">And we've seen firsthand why we need it.</span> <span data-start="850.78" data-end="855.56">We see the performance issues we're trying to overcome.</span> <span data-start="855.56" data-end="859.12">So I want to talk for a moment about the process</span> <span data-start="859.12" data-end="861.1">that we're going through.</span> <span data-start="861.1" data-end="864.73">Because it's actually not that common in recent years</span> <span data-start="864.73" data-end="866.95">for the web to add new high-level features.</span> <span data-start="866.95" data-end="873.07">And so we had a bunch of things that we really want to do — </span> <span data-start="873.07" data-end="874.75">and treat this sort of as a Guinea</span> <span data-start="874.75" data-end="879.04">pig for how we might add to higher-level features.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="879.04" data-end="880.78">We'll start with some basic principles.</span> <span data-start="883.345" data-end="884.72">Anytime you're building something</span> <span data-start="884.72" data-end="888.62">in the web platform itself, as opposed to in user space,</span> <span data-start="888.62" data-end="891.14">it's important to get the very basic use cases right.</span> <span data-start="891.14" data-end="894.35">Because web APIs live forever.</span> <span data-start="894.35" data-end="897.89">And it's much more important that we do the simple stuff</span> <span data-start="897.89" data-end="899.6">right.</span> <span data-start="899.6" data-end="901.52">So with that in mind, we wanted to make sure</span> <span data-start="901.52" data-end="902.93">that we learned from prior art.</span> <span data-start="902.93" data-end="905.3">There's obviously virtual scrollers on other platforms</span> <span data-start="905.3" data-end="908.48">and plenty of good work in the framework space.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="908.48" data-end="911.37">As I said, we want to make it simple.</span> <span data-start="911.37" data-end="913.047">We want the feature to be easy to use.</span> <span data-start="913.047" data-end="914.63">As much as possible, we want you to be</span> <span data-start="914.63" data-end="916.947">able to create web content that you just</span> <span data-start="916.947" data-end="918.53">happened to put in a virtual stroller,</span> <span data-start="918.53" data-end="921.17">as opposed to picking up a brand new API</span> <span data-start="921.17" data-end="922.85">and thinking fundamentally differently</span> <span data-start="922.85" data-end="924.099">about the way you build stuff.</span> <span data-start="926.65" data-end="928.84">Make it work —  it sounds trite, and it is.</span> <span data-start="928.84" data-end="931.72">But what I mean by this is everything needs to work.</span> <span data-start="931.72" data-end="932.65">We talked about links.</span> <span data-start="932.65" data-end="934">We talked about finding page.</span> <span data-start="934" data-end="935.77">It's critical that accessibility works.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="935.77" data-end="938.44">We want tapping from item to item to work.</span> <span data-start="941.172" data-end="942.63">And of course, it needs to be fast.</span> <span data-start="942.63" data-end="945.42">After all, this is a performance problem we're trying to solve.</span> <span data-start="948.321" data-end="948.82">OK.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="948.82" data-end="952.35">The next thing we want to do is we want to embrace layering.</span> <span data-start="952.35" data-end="956.58">And we'll talk a little bit more about what we mean by that.</span> <span data-start="956.58" data-end="960.93">Nicole actually mentioned this in the keynote.</span> <span data-start="960.93" data-end="963.66">One of the important things we want to do out of this process</span> <span data-start="963.66" data-end="966.78">is identify and implement any lower-level primitives</span> <span data-start="966.78" data-end="968.73">that the browser may be missing in order</span> <span data-start="968.73" data-end="972.27">to support this high-level use case.</span> <span data-start="972.27" data-end="973.71">We also want to enable this thing</span> <span data-start="973.71" data-end="975.99">to be used right out of the box, much like you use</span> <span data-start="975.99" data-end="977.88">a vanilla HTML and JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="977.88" data-end="980.46">We don't want you to have to pick up a framework</span> <span data-start="980.46" data-end="981.57">to do a virtual scrolling.</span> <span data-start="981.57" data-end="984.99">We'd like you to be able to use it on the web platform simply.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="984.99" data-end="987.42">But with that said, we also want to give</span> <span data-start="987.42" data-end="990.175">frameworks and libraries a solid base to build on.</span> <span data-start="990.175" data-end="991.8">And certainly, the low-level primitives</span> <span data-start="991.8" data-end="992.8">are things they can use.</span> <span data-start="992.8" data-end="995.04">But ideally, we'd like the virtual stroller</span> <span data-start="995.04" data-end="997.92">itself to be something that they can take, in whole or in part,</span> <span data-start="997.92" data-end="1001.37">and layer features on top of for their own virtual scrolling</span> <span data-start="1001.37" data-end="1004.34">solutions.</span> <span data-start="1004.34" data-end="1006.85">And as I mentioned, this is all really — </span> <span data-start="1006.85" data-end="1008.56">with the idea of blazing a trail.</span> <span data-start="1008.56" data-end="1011.5">We think that there's a lot of room to improve the developer</span> <span data-start="1011.5" data-end="1013.99">experience and the user experience of the web platform</span> <span data-start="1013.99" data-end="1017.75">by adding some high-level features in coming years.</span> <span data-start="1017.75" data-end="1020.26">And with that in mind, we want to use virtual scroller</span> <span data-start="1020.26" data-end="1022.96">as sort of a lens or a testing ground</span> <span data-start="1022.96" data-end="1027.294">for us to examine what it means to add new high-level features.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1027.294" data-end="1029.829">And so we'll talk about some of these things</span> <span data-start="1029.829" data-end="1033.244">as we look at the virtual stroller.</span> <span data-start="1033.244" data-end="1034.619">So with those principles in mind,</span> <span data-start="1034.619" data-end="1036.71">we sat down to do our homework.</span> <span data-start="1036.71" data-end="1038.91">And the first thing we did was we set up</span> <span data-start="1038.91" data-end="1041.819">what we called at that time the infinite list study group.</span> <span data-start="1041.819" data-end="1043.829">And we basically had a bunch of people</span> <span data-start="1043.829" data-end="1045.9">from across Chrome who would get together</span> <span data-start="1045.9" data-end="1047.13">once every couple of weeks.</span> <span data-start="1047.13" data-end="1049.046">And each time, someone would take the homework</span> <span data-start="1049.046" data-end="1051.46">of looking at a particular virtual scrolling solution</span> <span data-start="1051.46" data-end="1052.53">and reporting back.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1052.53" data-end="1053.92">And we would discuss it.</span> <span data-start="1053.92" data-end="1056.62">And we'd learn about what was working and what wasn't.</span> <span data-start="1056.62" data-end="1060.262">And we documented all this here on GitHub.</span> <span data-start="1060.262" data-end="1061.72">Once we'd done that for a while, we</span> <span data-start="1061.72" data-end="1064.33">came up with a set of requirements,</span> <span data-start="1064.33" data-end="1067.34">and it was time to start building.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1067.34" data-end="1069.034">Now I don't know what this is.</span> <span data-start="1069.034" data-end="1070.45">I think it's molding or something.</span> <span data-start="1070.45" data-end="1072.658">But it looks like something I'd really like to build.</span> <span data-start="1072.658" data-end="1075.1">So I put it on the slide.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1075.1" data-end="1078.34">And we have the same sort of love for virtual scroller.</span> <span data-start="1078.34" data-end="1080.44">So once we started implementation,</span> <span data-start="1080.44" data-end="1082.01">we did that on GitHub, as well.</span> <span data-start="1082.01" data-end="1083.676">And one of the things you'll notice here</span> <span data-start="1083.676" data-end="1085.21">is that virtual scroller is being</span> <span data-start="1085.21" data-end="1087.61">implemented in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="1087.61" data-end="1090.67">And this obviously is sort of unusual for something</span> <span data-start="1090.67" data-end="1093.91">that's under consideration for a web platform API.</span> <span data-start="1093.91" data-end="1098.41">It's not typically how we build platform APIs.</span> <span data-start="1098.41" data-end="1100.36">But this gets to the layering concept.</span> <span data-start="1100.36" data-end="1101.901">We wanted to make sure that we didn't</span> <span data-start="1101.901" data-end="1105.502">reserve any special powers in adding these features.</span> <span data-start="1105.502" data-end="1106.96">And one of the best ways to do that</span> <span data-start="1106.96" data-end="1110.29">is to develop things on the same environment</span> <span data-start="1110.29" data-end="1112.87">that framework and app developers develop in.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1117.866" data-end="1119.74">So the next important thing about the process</span> <span data-start="1119.74" data-end="1121.75">is we wanted to be in constant dialogue.</span> <span data-start="1121.75" data-end="1123.37">We talked about the fact that we're doing these things</span> <span data-start="1123.37" data-end="1124.66">out in the open and GitHub.</span> <span data-start="1124.66" data-end="1126.877">But also, we've been talking to people all along.</span> <span data-start="1126.877" data-end="1129.46">So we've been talking to other browser vendors about the ideas</span> <span data-start="1129.46" data-end="1131.83">behind virtual stroller and the principles</span> <span data-start="1131.83" data-end="1134.56">that we're trying to look at for adding new high-level features.</span> <span data-start="1134.56" data-end="1137.3">We've been talking to framework and library authors.</span> <span data-start="1137.3" data-end="1142.51">So along the way, we've talked to members of the Angular team</span> <span data-start="1142.51" data-end="1146.5">who were working on the Angular Material stroller.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1146.5" data-end="1149.11">We talked to the AMP team.</span> <span data-start="1149.11" data-end="1152.86">We've talked to members of the Ionic team who are working</span> <span data-start="1152.86" data-end="1155.11">on their own virtual stroller.</span> <span data-start="1155.11" data-end="1156.88">And we've talked with Brian Vaughn,</span> <span data-start="1156.88" data-end="1158.77">who's the author of react-virtualized</span> <span data-start="1158.77" data-end="1162.44">and react-window, as well.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1162.44" data-end="1165.16">And we also have very active discussions going on in GitHub.</span> <span data-start="1165.16" data-end="1170.02">So it's important to us that this process be carried out</span> <span data-start="1170.02" data-end="1172.7">in the open and with the input of the community,</span> <span data-start="1172.7" data-end="1174.107">including frameworks.</span> <span data-start="1179.47" data-end="1180.124">OK.</span> <span data-start="1180.124" data-end="1182.04">With that process as backdrop, let's go ahead,</span> <span data-start="1182.04" data-end="1186.14">and look at what we've built.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1186.14" data-end="1188.81">So this is that example we were looking at before.</span> <span data-start="1188.81" data-end="1190.67">And I show it here in Dev Tools just</span> <span data-start="1190.67" data-end="1193.34">so you can see, as we scroll, there</span> <span data-start="1193.34" data-end="1198.03">are just a few items in the DOM at any given time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1198.03" data-end="1200.42">And when we scroll, you'll see them cycle in and out.</span> <span data-start="1203.76" data-end="1207.18">And so, even though we have a list of 5,000 items</span> <span data-start="1207.18" data-end="1209.43">here, at any given time, we're only</span> <span data-start="1209.43" data-end="1215.84">laying out, styling, rendering a very small number of them.</span> <span data-start="1215.84" data-end="1217.57">And as you can see, the virtual scroller</span> <span data-start="1217.57" data-end="1221.08">itself is a custom element.</span> <span data-start="1221.08" data-end="1222.58">And let's see how you would actually</span> <span data-start="1222.58" data-end="1224.015">use that in vanilla style.</span> <span data-start="1227.88" data-end="1229.807">So starting from a blank slate here,</span> <span data-start="1229.807" data-end="1231.39">the first thing that we're going to do</span> <span data-start="1231.39" data-end="1234.69">is we're going to use the browser's native module</span> <span data-start="1234.69" data-end="1236.43">loader to import this.</span> <span data-start="1236.43" data-end="1239.25">Now this is also a new concept that we're</span> <span data-start="1239.25" data-end="1241.77">trying out as part of the way we're</span> <span data-start="1241.77" data-end="1243.93">thinking about higher-level APIs.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1243.93" data-end="1247.71">Typically, browser APIs are sort of baked into every page.</span> <span data-start="1247.71" data-end="1248.46">You may use them.</span> <span data-start="1248.46" data-end="1249.06">You may not.</span> <span data-start="1249.06" data-end="1252.6">But there is a memory impact, and the size of the browser</span> <span data-start="1252.6" data-end="1254.73">is impacted.</span> <span data-start="1254.73" data-end="1257.06">We'd like to explore a pay-as-you-go model.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1257.06" data-end="1259.75">And so we already have, in the form of the module loader,</span> <span data-start="1259.75" data-end="1266.25">a way to dynamically load libraries and code at runtime.</span> <span data-start="1266.25" data-end="1267.79">And so we're using that here.</span> <span data-start="1267.79" data-end="1273.632">And you can see we have a proposed syntax for requesting</span> <span data-start="1273.632" data-end="1276.09">something that would be part of a standard library provided</span> <span data-start="1276.09" data-end="1276.869">by the browser.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1276.869" data-end="1278.41">And I won't go into the details here.</span> <span data-start="1278.41" data-end="1281.17">But you can read about it.</span> <span data-start="1281.17" data-end="1284.5">So once we've imported it, we just</span> <span data-start="1284.5" data-end="1289.25">put the virtual scroller tag in our HTML document.</span> <span data-start="1289.25" data-end="1292.164">And this is what you get without doing anything more.</span> <span data-start="1292.164" data-end="1294.08">You can see the virtual scroller has a default</span> <span data-start="1294.08" data-end="1300.35">size, much like for an iframe.</span> <span data-start="1300.35" data-end="1302.39">And so it's not doing anything yet.</span> <span data-start="1302.39" data-end="1305.52">Let's make it do something.</span> <span data-start="1305.52" data-end="1311.08">So first, ordinary querySelector to find the virtual stroller.</span> <span data-start="1311.08" data-end="1313.49">We're just going to fetch some data.</span> <span data-start="1313.49" data-end="1315.74">And then here's the first bit of virtual scroller API.</span> <span data-start="1315.74" data-end="1316.97">It's an item source.</span> <span data-start="1316.97" data-end="1322.91">You can assign this in an ordinary array,</span> <span data-start="1322.91" data-end="1324.21">as we've done here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1324.21" data-end="1326.79">And then we'll call our async function.</span> <span data-start="1326.79" data-end="1329.6">And we get that, which probably isn't exactly what we want,</span> <span data-start="1329.6" data-end="1330.11">either.</span> <span data-start="1330.11" data-end="1332.63">So we wanted the virtual scrolling</span> <span data-start="1332.63" data-end="1335.09">to do something by default. And so what it does</span> <span data-start="1335.09" data-end="1339.02">is it just takes the item, and it tries</span> <span data-start="1339.02" data-end="1341.45">to render it into the item.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1341.45" data-end="1343.64">And in this case, it's a string.</span> <span data-start="1343.64" data-end="1345.57">And it doesn't look very good.</span> <span data-start="1345.57" data-end="1348.62">So let's fix that.</span> <span data-start="1348.62" data-end="1352.99">So the next bit of API is this update element hook.</span> <span data-start="1352.99" data-end="1356.26">So here we're basically just going to take the contact name</span> <span data-start="1356.26" data-end="1359.17">and put that in the text content.</span> <span data-start="1359.17" data-end="1363.02">And there we have something that looks much more useful.</span> <span data-start="1363.02" data-end="1366.16">So just a few lines of code, vanilla HTML, and JavaScript,</span> <span data-start="1366.16" data-end="1367.57">and we have a virtual scroller.</span> <span data-start="1370.107" data-end="1371.815">So let's take a look at one more example.</span> <span data-start="1375.17" data-end="1378.01">You notice the virtual scroller initially was empty.</span> <span data-start="1378.01" data-end="1380.71">And by default, it will just create a div for each item.</span> <span data-start="1380.71" data-end="1382.06">You can actually override that.</span> <span data-start="1382.06" data-end="1383.476">In addition to the update element,</span> <span data-start="1383.476" data-end="1386.35">there's a create element hook, and you can give it</span> <span data-start="1386.35" data-end="1388.84">any kind of DOM you want.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1388.84" data-end="1391.45">But you can also put a template inside the virtual stroller.</span> <span data-start="1391.45" data-end="1392.95">And whatever is there will be what's</span> <span data-start="1392.95" data-end="1396.08">instantiated for each item.</span> <span data-start="1396.08" data-end="1397.21">So I'm going to go ahead.</span> <span data-start="1397.21" data-end="1399.495">And in my update element function,</span> <span data-start="1399.495" data-end="1401.947">I'm going to assign the image.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1401.947" data-end="1403.78">And then lastly, I'm going to specify that I</span> <span data-start="1403.78" data-end="1405.13">want a vertical grid layout.</span> <span data-start="1405.13" data-end="1408.76">So out of the box, it supports vertical, and horizontal,</span> <span data-start="1408.76" data-end="1411.88">normal, and grid layouts.</span> <span data-start="1411.88" data-end="1413.98">Layouts are actually pluggable under the hood.</span> <span data-start="1413.98" data-end="1417.19">It's TBD whether that gets exposed in the API</span> <span data-start="1417.19" data-end="1420.24">as it eventually ships.</span> <span data-start="1420.24" data-end="1420.95">OK.</span> <span data-start="1420.95" data-end="1423.41">So as I mentioned, we're taking a layered approach.</span> <span data-start="1423.41" data-end="1426.08">We're not building fancy features like custom headers</span> <span data-start="1426.08" data-end="1426.97">and things in.</span> <span data-start="1426.97" data-end="1429.17">But it is important to us that these things work.</span> <span data-start="1429.17" data-end="1431.43">Because again, we want layering.</span> <span data-start="1431.43" data-end="1434.3">So here's a case where we have headers</span> <span data-start="1434.3" data-end="1436.98">interspersed with list items.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1436.98" data-end="1439.684">These are all examples that you'll find in our GitHub repo.</span> <span data-start="1439.684" data-end="1442.1">So the other thing is, it's important —  we want to support</span> <span data-start="1442.1" data-end="1444.21">various loading patterns.</span> <span data-start="1444.21" data-end="1445.85">So this is a common one, where it's</span> <span data-start="1445.85" data-end="1449.18">sort of an infinite scroll, and as you go,</span> <span data-start="1449.18" data-end="1451.73">each item gets loaded, and you just keeps scrolling.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1451.73" data-end="1453.95">We also support the other common pattern,</span> <span data-start="1453.95" data-end="1458.13">where you scroll to the bottom, you explicitly ask for more.</span> <span data-start="1458.13" data-end="1460.67">So again, we're validating that our basic constructs are</span> <span data-start="1460.67" data-end="1461.9">working for these use cases.</span> <span data-start="1464.48" data-end="1466.97">Fancier features —  if you've ever built stuff</span> <span data-start="1466.97" data-end="1468.57">like this, worked with the UX team,</span> <span data-start="1468.57" data-end="1470.87">inevitably they're going to want fancy stuff.</span> <span data-start="1470.87" data-end="1472.55">So here's a proof of concept that</span> <span data-start="1472.55" data-end="1475.16">shows that things like swipe to dismiss</span> <span data-start="1475.16" data-end="1478.82">can work with this virtual scroller, as well.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1487.21" data-end="1487.79">OK.</span> <span data-start="1487.79" data-end="1490.49">So we mentioned that we thought there</span> <span data-start="1490.49" data-end="1494.83">would be some missing primitives that we might discover.</span> <span data-start="1494.83" data-end="1496.4">And we think we found one.</span> <span data-start="1496.4" data-end="1499.46">Specifically, it's called invisible DOM.</span> <span data-start="1499.46" data-end="1501.749">So you remember our earlier examples.</span> <span data-start="1501.749" data-end="1504.29">In this one, you'll see it's a lot like the virtual scroller,</span> <span data-start="1504.29" data-end="1506.3">except instead of actually getting rid of</span> <span data-start="1506.3" data-end="1510.08">and adding nodes, it's basically just making nodes invisible.</span> <span data-start="1510.08" data-end="1512.63">Invisible DOM is in the document,</span> <span data-start="1512.63" data-end="1515.39">much like a display none element But it's</span> <span data-start="1515.39" data-end="1518.855">different from display none, in that it can be linked to</span> <span data-start="1518.855" data-end="1522.88">and it can be found by the browser's Find In page.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1522.88" data-end="1524.63">And so here's an example, where we</span> <span data-start="1524.63" data-end="1529.55">have non-traditional virtual scroll type of content.</span> <span data-start="1529.55" data-end="1531.08">This is a document, much like you</span> <span data-start="1531.08" data-end="1534.28">might find in Wikipedia or a long-form news article.</span> <span data-start="1534.28" data-end="1536.75">And you can see — </span> <span data-start="1536.75" data-end="1537.26">here it is.</span> <span data-start="1537.26" data-end="1538.767">We get a certain way down the list.</span> <span data-start="1538.767" data-end="1541.1">And all of the sudden, there's nothing highlighting over</span> <span data-start="1541.1" data-end="1541.683">in the window.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1541.683" data-end="1544.71">Because some of these DOM nodes are invisible.</span> <span data-start="1544.71" data-end="1545.79">They're just not there.</span> <span data-start="1545.79" data-end="1549.5">And as we scroll, we'll see that they're basically</span> <span data-start="1549.5" data-end="1552.3">being flipped to visible.</span> <span data-start="1552.3" data-end="1556.43">And so when the virtual scroller is working with invisible DOM,</span> <span data-start="1556.43" data-end="1557.45">this is how it works.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1560.53" data-end="1565.69">So you'll see here, we'll do some resizing,</span> <span data-start="1565.69" data-end="1566.707">changing orientation.</span> <span data-start="1566.707" data-end="1568.54">And you'll see that the layout is preserved.</span> <span data-start="1568.54" data-end="1572.26">Again, this is just ordinary styling and layout</span> <span data-start="1572.26" data-end="1572.92">on these items.</span> <span data-start="1572.92" data-end="1574.78">And virtual scroller works with them out of the box.</span> <span data-start="1574.78" data-end="1576.22">This is what we were talking about when we said</span> <span data-start="1576.22" data-end="1577.4">we wanted to make it simple.</span> <span data-start="1577.4" data-end="1578.9">We don't want you have to think hard</span> <span data-start="1578.9" data-end="1580.51">about using a virtual scroller.</span> <span data-start="1580.51" data-end="1583.53">So what we're looking at here, though —  is the cool thing — </span> <span data-start="1583.53" data-end="1584.29">its links.</span> <span data-start="1584.29" data-end="1587.15">And this is what invisible DOM is making possible for us.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1587.15" data-end="1589.08">So when I click on one of those links,</span> <span data-start="1589.08" data-end="1590.83">the DOM nodes that it's linking to are not</span> <span data-start="1590.83" data-end="1593.217">even in the document yet — </span> <span data-start="1593.217" data-end="1595.55">well, they're in the document, but they're not rendered.</span> <span data-start="1595.55" data-end="1597.22">And so you get an event on them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1597.22" data-end="1599.08">And by default, the browser will actually</span> <span data-start="1599.08" data-end="1600.747">flip visible and scroll to it.</span> <span data-start="1600.747" data-end="1602.33">But in the case of a virtual stroller,</span> <span data-start="1602.33" data-end="1604.96">we're capturing that event.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1604.96" data-end="1607.586">We're scrolling to it.</span> <span data-start="1607.586" data-end="1608.96">But in the process of doing that,</span> <span data-start="1608.96" data-end="1610.64">we're rendering all the context around it.</span> <span data-start="1610.64" data-end="1611.764">So it's perfectly seamless.</span> <span data-start="1611.764" data-end="1613.48">To the end user who's using invisible DOM</span> <span data-start="1613.48" data-end="1615.1">with a virtual scroller, it's exactly</span> <span data-start="1615.1" data-end="1617.558">as if the entire document had been rendered the whole time.</span> <span data-start="1620.61" data-end="1623.07">And I am just about out of time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1623.07" data-end="1626.69">But I wanted to show you one of the exciting things about using</span> <span data-start="1626.69" data-end="1628.85">invisible DOM with virtual stroller</span> <span data-start="1628.85" data-end="1631.79">is that it means you can actually put invisible content</span> <span data-start="1631.79" data-end="1633.17">directly in a document.</span> <span data-start="1633.17" data-end="1635.78">And we're talking with our friends over in Search.</span> <span data-start="1635.78" data-end="1639.41">And the idea is that you'd be able to effectively</span> <span data-start="1639.41" data-end="1641.51">have your content be entirely indexable</span> <span data-start="1641.51" data-end="1644.75">but to benefit from the performance</span> <span data-start="1644.75" data-end="1647.21">wins of virtual scrolling by not having a render it</span> <span data-start="1647.21" data-end="1650.24">all on first load.</span> <span data-start="1650.24" data-end="1653.75">So very quickly, I'll talk about the path forward.</span> <span data-start="1653.75" data-end="1657.68">Again, very early days —  but very encouraging results.</span> <span data-start="1657.68" data-end="1658.959">What's next?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1658.959" data-end="1660.25">More invisible DOM integration.</span> <span data-start="1660.25" data-end="1661.967">We've really just started exploring</span> <span data-start="1661.967" data-end="1663.05">how the two play together.</span> <span data-start="1663.05" data-end="1665.6">Because thanks to some great work</span> <span data-start="1665.6" data-end="1667.67">from [? Raquina ?] on our DOM team,</span> <span data-start="1667.67" data-end="1671.06">we've just had a working version of it become available</span> <span data-start="1671.06" data-end="1671.69">very recently.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1671.69" data-end="1677.21">In fact, it's available behind the flag in Chrome Canary.</span> <span data-start="1677.21" data-end="1681.09">We think there may be additional primitives, as well.</span> <span data-start="1681.09" data-end="1682.43">We've talked about some.</span> <span data-start="1682.43" data-end="1683.71">I won't go into detail here.</span> <span data-start="1683.71" data-end="1686.9">But invisible DOM is just the first.</span> <span data-start="1686.9" data-end="1689">Framework collaborations —  so from the start,</span> <span data-start="1689" data-end="1693.59">we've actually in the repo had proof of concept integrations</span> <span data-start="1693.59" data-end="1696.59">with lit-HTML and with Preact.</span> <span data-start="1696.59" data-end="1698.094">And for this talk — </span> <span data-start="1698.094" data-end="1699.26">but I'd end up getting cut — </span> <span data-start="1699.26" data-end="1702.48">I did a basic react integration, as well.</span> <span data-start="1702.48" data-end="1704.09">But it's very early there, and we</span> <span data-start="1704.09" data-end="1706.34">haven't worked closely with the frameworks on that specifically</span> <span data-start="1706.34" data-end="1706.84">yet.</span> <span data-start="1710.87" data-end="1714.57">More advanced use cases —  so we saw some of those examples.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1714.57" data-end="1718.25">But there are others that we have not gotten to yet.</span> <span data-start="1718.25" data-end="1720.94">Performance optimization —  it's pretty darn fast right now.</span> <span data-start="1720.94" data-end="1723.65">But there actually hasn't been intensive optimization</span> <span data-start="1723.65" data-end="1725.58">done on it yet.</span> <span data-start="1725.58" data-end="1727.96">And then importantly, down-the-stack explorations — </span> <span data-start="1727.96" data-end="1730.46">so one of the first questions we get when we talk about this</span> <span data-start="1730.46" data-end="1732.849">is, why doesn't the browser just do this stuff better</span> <span data-start="1732.849" data-end="1733.64">in the first place?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1733.64" data-end="1735.38">Why do you need a virtual scroller?</span> <span data-start="1735.38" data-end="1736.82">Can't the browser just do this?</span> <span data-start="1736.82" data-end="1738.83">And these are discussions that we're</span> <span data-start="1738.83" data-end="1741.9">having not only externally, but also internally.</span> <span data-start="1741.9" data-end="1744.44">And it's a long, complicated story.</span> <span data-start="1744.44" data-end="1746.42">Browser layout is complicated.</span> <span data-start="1746.42" data-end="1747.17">And in much</span> <span data-start="1747.17" data-end="1749.75">The way that AMP simplifies building pages,</span> <span data-start="1749.75" data-end="1751.7">virtual scroller can simplify layout</span> <span data-start="1751.7" data-end="1753.54">by locking you into a much simpler model.</span> <span data-start="1753.54" data-end="1754.83">And there are some wins there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1754.83" data-end="1756.92">But that being said, it's very possible</span> <span data-start="1756.92" data-end="1762.094">that we can also pursue other types of optimizations</span> <span data-start="1762.094" data-end="1763.76">further down the stack that get you some</span> <span data-start="1763.76" data-end="1765.47">of the same types of benefits without even having</span> <span data-start="1765.47" data-end="1766.46">to go to a virtual stroller.</span> <span data-start="1766.46" data-end="1768.817">And those are certainly things that we're discussing.</span> <span data-start="1772.3" data-end="1773.86">The standards process —  so again,</span> <span data-start="1773.86" data-end="1776.226">we've been talking to other browser vendors all along.</span> <span data-start="1776.226" data-end="1778.6">But it's very early for this and other similar high-level</span> <span data-start="1778.6" data-end="1779.68">features.</span> <span data-start="1779.68" data-end="1781.3">And the list could go on.</span> <span data-start="1781.3" data-end="1783.82">So if you're interested, I invite you</span> <span data-start="1783.82" data-end="1786.58">to engage with us on GitHub.</span> <span data-start="1786.58" data-end="1789.64">We have a very active set of discussions going on</span> <span data-start="1789.64" data-end="1792.81">in the issues here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1792.81" data-end="1797.55">And here is the GitHub repo where you'll find us.</span> <span data-start="1797.55" data-end="1800.305">And with that, I've been excited to show you virtual scroller.</span> <span data-start="1800.305" data-end="1801.93">I hope you're as excited as I am to see</span> <span data-start="1801.93" data-end="1804.14">it come into the web platform.</span>
