<p><span data-start="41.59" data-end="44.72">The last bit is one that Yoav and and I already mentioned,</span> <span data-start="44.72" data-end="47.53">which is the Web Platform Incubation Community group.</span> <span data-start="47.53" data-end="49.6">We usually call this WICG.</span> <span data-start="49.6" data-end="51.79">We co-chair this along with Marcos Caceres</span> <span data-start="51.79" data-end="54.88">from Mozilla and Travis Leithead from Microsoft.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="54.88" data-end="56.8">And this is the place where we start</span> <span data-start="56.8" data-end="59.495">the journey of a lot of these collaborative efforts.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="59.495" data-end="61.87"><span class="speaker">Yoav Weiss</span>: Chromium is a huge open source project that's</span> <span data-start="61.87" data-end="66.49">seeing 90,000 commits a year from over 2,000</span> <span data-start="66.49" data-end="69.43">different contributors working for 55</span> <span data-start="69.43" data-end="73.06">different companies, potentially with multiple organizations</span> <span data-start="73.06" data-end="75.25">inside of each company.</span> <span data-start="75.25" data-end="77.98">And each one of those parties have slightly different</span> <span data-start="77.98" data-end="80.17">interests.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="80.17" data-end="82.54">It's also important to recognize that a lot</span> <span data-start="82.54" data-end="86.33">of those contributions are coming from Google employees,</span> <span data-start="86.33" data-end="91.24">but non-Google contributors are almost 20% of that pie chart.</span> <span data-start="91.24" data-end="93.85">In order to make sure that all of those contributions</span> <span data-start="93.85" data-end="98.112">from different parties all make sense, we need an open process.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="98.112" data-end="99.82"><span class="speaker">Chris Wilson</span>: If you've interacted at all</span> <span data-start="99.82" data-end="101.71">with the Chromium open source project,</span> <span data-start="101.71" data-end="104.68">you've probably seen people talking about intents — </span> <span data-start="104.68" data-end="107.14">intents to implement, intents to ship.</span> <span data-start="107.14" data-end="110.38">These intents are part of the Blink process, where</span> <span data-start="110.38" data-end="112.09">a set of trusted Chromium engineers,</span> <span data-start="112.09" data-end="114.52">called the API owners, such as Yoav,</span> <span data-start="114.52" data-end="116.23">make sure that the trade-off is being</span> <span data-start="116.23" data-end="118.39">taken into account by the engineers working</span> <span data-start="118.39" data-end="119.74">on different features.</span> <span data-start="119.74" data-end="122.2">Mozilla has a very similar process.</span> <span data-start="122.2" data-end="125.93">Part of our process grew from the WebKit process as well.</span> <span data-start="125.93" data-end="127.78">But as part of these processes, engineers</span> <span data-start="127.78" data-end="129.82">need to show that there's industry agreement</span> <span data-start="129.82" data-end="132.31">or backing that the feature they're trying to ship</span> <span data-start="132.31" data-end="136">is an important one, and also that the features' design was</span> <span data-start="136" data-end="137.53">properly reviewed.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="137.53" data-end="140.14">That Blink process is not a replacement for the standards</span> <span data-start="140.14" data-end="142.36">process, but a separate one.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="142.36" data-end="145.57"><span class="speaker">Yoav Weiss</span>: To recap, the typical journey of an API</span> <span data-start="145.57" data-end="148.6">goes from researching the problem space,</span> <span data-start="148.6" data-end="151.33">publishing an explainer with use cases,</span> <span data-start="151.33" data-end="155.74">designing a solution in the open with interested parties,</span> <span data-start="155.74" data-end="157.91">experimenting with that solution,</span> <span data-start="157.91" data-end="160.893">and eventually shipping it or not.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="160.893" data-end="163.06"><span class="speaker">Chris Wilson</span>: So what we would like you to take away</span> <span data-start="163.06" data-end="165.1">from this talk is, first, there is</span> <span data-start="165.1" data-end="168.52">a difference between Chromium process and standards process.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="168.52" data-end="170.35">They work together, but they're not</span> <span data-start="170.35" data-end="172.12">replacements for each other.</span> <span data-start="172.12" data-end="174.64">Our intent process is intended to make it possible</span> <span data-start="174.64" data-end="177.022">for us to move the web platform forward,</span> <span data-start="177.022" data-end="178.48">even if we have to go out on a limb</span> <span data-start="178.48" data-end="180.85">sometimes, but also work together with the standards</span> <span data-start="180.85" data-end="181.35">process.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="184.04" data-end="186.29"><span class="speaker">Greg Whitworth</span>: And at Microsoft, we completely agree.</span> <span data-start="186.29" data-end="188.373">On the move from EdgeHTML over to Chromium,</span> <span data-start="188.373" data-end="190.79">we did a full inventory of some of the goodness we thought</span> <span data-start="190.79" data-end="193.547">was in EdgeHTML and wanted to bring over to Chromium.</span> <span data-start="193.547" data-end="195.63">We reached out to our good friends over at Google,</span> <span data-start="195.63" data-end="197.3">and they completely agreed, because one</span> <span data-start="197.3" data-end="199.842">of the things we wanted to look into, that we'll be covering,</span> <span data-start="199.842" data-end="200.66">is form controls.</span> <span data-start="200.66" data-end="203.75">And starting up, we were with accessibility, touch,</span> <span data-start="203.75" data-end="205.7">and ultimately a fresh coat of paint,</span> <span data-start="205.7" data-end="207.242">because when we were looking at them,</span> <span data-start="207.242" data-end="209.01">they were pretty dated as you'll see.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="209.01" data-end="211.13">And we'll also be covering scalability,</span> <span data-start="211.13" data-end="213.23">extending functionality, and then ultimately,</span> <span data-start="213.23" data-end="215.48">as Nicole was saying, new components.</span> <span data-start="215.48" data-end="218.27">And then we have this lovely Windows 95</span> <span data-start="218.27" data-end="222.147">draggable element here in the range, which is definitely</span> <span data-start="222.147" data-end="223.23">in the need of an upgrade.</span> <span data-start="223.23" data-end="226.11">So we gave it a more modern splash coat of paint</span> <span data-start="226.11" data-end="227.575">to flatten it up a little bit.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="227.575" data-end="229.7">So hopefully, it looks a lot better to you as well.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="229.7" data-end="231.795"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: And for Chrome, we</span> <span data-start="231.795" data-end="233.42">decided to experiment with a little bit</span> <span data-start="233.42" data-end="235.36">of a different visual detail.</span> <span data-start="235.36" data-end="237.865">We are showing the selected portion of the range in color.</span> <span data-start="237.865" data-end="239.24">We'd love to know what you think.</span> <span data-start="239.24" data-end="241.52">This is something we're still playing with and trying</span> <span data-start="241.52" data-end="243.65">to figure out what works well.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="243.65" data-end="246.77"><span class="speaker">Greg Whitworth</span>: And checkbox and radio, they're small,</span> <span data-start="246.77" data-end="249.98">but they're also really, really impactful form controls.</span> <span data-start="249.98" data-end="251.75">They're on almost all of our forms.</span> <span data-start="251.75" data-end="253.49">And while, again, there's subtle changes,</span> <span data-start="253.49" data-end="255.89">those gradients are very, very indicative of the era</span> <span data-start="255.89" data-end="256.972">that they came out.</span> <span data-start="256.972" data-end="258.68">And we've now flattened, modernized them.</span> <span data-start="258.68" data-end="260.99">And hopefully, they fit better in all of your form controls</span> <span data-start="260.99" data-end="262.44">on your websites that you're making.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="262.44" data-end="264.982"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: I believe that you lit the path for us here.</span> <span data-start="264.982" data-end="266.06">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="266.06" data-end="267.92">On Chrome, again, we decided to experiment</span> <span data-start="267.92" data-end="270.35">with color for the selected state.</span> <span data-start="270.35" data-end="273.26">So that said, though, we share about 99%</span> <span data-start="273.26" data-end="274.85">of the code for these elements.</span> <span data-start="274.85" data-end="277.058">And so that's going to make the next steps that we're</span> <span data-start="277.058" data-end="278.49">talking about a lot easier.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="278.49" data-end="279.47"><span class="speaker">Greg Whitworth</span>: Another important aspect,</span> <span data-start="279.47" data-end="281.33">as we started off with, was accessibility.</span> <span data-start="281.33" data-end="282.83">And one of these things is it really</span> <span data-start="282.83" data-end="285.038">doesn't matter about the input modality you're using.</span> <span data-start="285.038" data-end="287.5">You should be able to use the control in a good way.</span> <span data-start="287.5" data-end="290.24">And touch is one of those things, as you all know.</span> <span data-start="290.24" data-end="292.85">I've been using the Macs over at the booth,</span> <span data-start="292.85" data-end="295.79">and I keep touching the touchscreen that isn't there.</span> <span data-start="295.79" data-end="297.53">We have the 2-in-1 Windows devices,</span> <span data-start="297.53" data-end="300.14">and so touch is very important to us.</span> <span data-start="300.14" data-end="303.02">And so we increased the hit test regions on —  here's Date.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="303.02" data-end="306.59">But the control, I think, that shows this the most is the Time</span> <span data-start="306.59" data-end="309.2">element, which, as you can see, here's the current Chromium</span> <span data-start="309.2" data-end="310.7">one with those wonderful little tiny</span> <span data-start="310.7" data-end="312.53">spinners that good luck trying to touch</span> <span data-start="312.53" data-end="314.16">those with your fingers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="314.16" data-end="316.94">We now have the similar pop-up that we have in Date.</span> <span data-start="316.94" data-end="320.6">And you've got the normal touch scroll carousel-type feel</span> <span data-start="320.6" data-end="322.378">to have a good user experience.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="322.378" data-end="324.17"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: So we wanted to understand</span> <span data-start="324.17" data-end="327.53">why form elements are recreated as sort of a starting point</span> <span data-start="327.53" data-end="330.92">for understanding what we could do differently.</span> <span data-start="330.92" data-end="335.26">The top 10 form controls that are recreated by web developers</span> <span data-start="335.26" data-end="336.26">are here on this screen.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="336.26" data-end="337.67">The top one is Select.</span> </p>

</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="338.793" data-end="341.21"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: Yeah, I think we all saw that one coming.</span> <span data-start="341.21" data-end="344.45">Checkbox, Date, Radio, and File, and then a few others</span> <span data-start="344.45" data-end="345.86">that are used as well.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="348.005" data-end="349.88"><span class="speaker">Paul Lewis</span>: For the most part, we can probably</span> <span data-start="349.88" data-end="352.07">agree that most web developers do not</span> <span data-start="352.07" data-end="355.82">build entirely custom infrastructure and tooling.</span> <span data-start="355.82" data-end="358.01">Where possible, developers usually</span> <span data-start="358.01" data-end="362.19">prefer to rely on open source tools.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="362.19" data-end="366.05">So one way to improve actual websites that developers ship</span> <span data-start="366.05" data-end="368.93">are to improve the actual tools that are being</span> <span data-start="368.93" data-end="371.72">used to build those sites.</span> <span data-start="371.72" data-end="373.91">Better open source tooling can directly</span> <span data-start="373.91" data-end="376.39">result in a better web.</span> <span data-start="376.39" data-end="379.16">MDN will soon release the first edition of their developer</span> <span data-start="379.16" data-end="381.53">and designer survey to try and learn more</span> <span data-start="381.53" data-end="385.61">about the needs and frustrations of web developers.</span> <span data-start="385.61" data-end="390.14">With over 28,000 responses, one interesting result</span> <span data-start="390.14" data-end="393.5">from the survey was that 72% of respondents</span> <span data-start="393.5" data-end="398.665">actively use React, Angular, or View for their sites.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="398.665" data-end="400.79"><span class="speaker">Timothy Jordan</span>: So how should we invest in the framework</span> <span data-start="400.79" data-end="406.49">ecosystem to address both DX and UX challenges?</span> <span data-start="406.49" data-end="409.34">We think there's a big opportunity here for tooling</span> <span data-start="409.34" data-end="411.53">to help with both of these problems,</span> <span data-start="411.53" data-end="414.14">in particular, by bringing good defaults</span> <span data-start="414.14" data-end="416.473">and by being opinionated.</span> <span data-start="416.473" data-end="417.89">So I'm going to take a moment here</span> <span data-start="417.89" data-end="420.38">to define this notion of what we decided</span> <span data-start="420.38" data-end="422.06">to call a web framework.</span> <span data-start="422.06" data-end="425.42">It's an end-to-end system that controls every aspect</span> <span data-start="425.42" data-end="428.12">from getting started, everyday development,</span> <span data-start="428.12" data-end="429.59">through deployment.</span> </p>
