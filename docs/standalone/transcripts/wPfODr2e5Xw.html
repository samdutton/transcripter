<p><span data-start="39.96" data-end="43.29">The web empowers users to explore and discover easily,</span> <span data-start="43.29" data-end="46.26">and in the moment without the burden of installation.</span> <span data-start="46.26" data-end="48.75">In addition, the web also unifies hardware</span> <span data-start="48.75" data-end="50.05">and ecosystems.</span> <span data-start="50.05" data-end="54.21">It runs on laptops, phones, desktops, even cars.</span> <span data-start="54.21" data-end="57.18">For XR hardware, like virtual reality headsets,</span> <span data-start="57.18" data-end="60.27">there are already numerous siloed app ecosystems</span> <span data-start="60.27" data-end="64.019">that exclusively cater to their respective hardware platforms.</span> <span data-start="64.019" data-end="66.3">The web unifies these device ecosystems</span> <span data-start="66.3" data-end="69.54">under one common XR platform, while also serving</span> <span data-start="69.54" data-end="73.2">foreign factors like smartphones and augmented reality headsets.</span> <span data-start="73.2" data-end="76.02">The web provides a clear path to broadly access</span> <span data-start="76.02" data-end="78.78">users, devices, and ecosystems.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="78.78" data-end="81.21">That, in conjunction with compelling use cases</span> <span data-start="81.21" data-end="83.13">that are best served ephemerally,</span> <span data-start="83.13" data-end="85.727">has driven us to push the immersive web forward.</span> <span data-start="85.727" data-end="87.81">And we have some exciting updates and user stories</span> <span data-start="87.81" data-end="89.4">to share.</span> <span data-start="89.4" data-end="93.13">Last year at CDS, we previewed the WebXR device API,</span> <span data-start="93.13" data-end="96.3">an imperative API that enables web developers to create</span> <span data-start="96.3" data-end="100.47">VR experiences for tethered and mobile VR systems.</span> <span data-start="100.47" data-end="102.57">We're excited to announce that the core VR</span> <span data-start="102.57" data-end="105.09">capabilities of the WebXR device API</span> <span data-start="105.09" data-end="108.72">are available now in Chrome 79 beta.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="108.72" data-end="112.35">Next month, we will ship WebXR in Chrome Stable in the 79</span> <span data-start="112.35" data-end="113.82">release.</span> <span data-start="113.82" data-end="115.95">We're ecstatic to be joined by other browsers,</span> <span data-start="115.95" data-end="118.86">like Firefox Reality and Oculus Browser, who</span> <span data-start="118.86" data-end="122.16">will also be shipping WebXR before the end of the year.</span> <span data-start="122.16" data-end="125.7">This solidifies the foundation for VR within the web platform,</span> <span data-start="125.7" data-end="129.21">completing what WebVR started years ago.</span> <span data-start="129.21" data-end="132.75">Three.js continues to be a flagship library in simplifying</span> <span data-start="132.75" data-end="136.26">and extending access for web developers to 3D programming.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="136.26" data-end="139.26">Version 110 and later feature important updates</span> <span data-start="139.26" data-end="141.545">to its WebXR support, taking care</span> <span data-start="141.545" data-end="142.92">of the heavy lifting with regards</span> <span data-start="142.92" data-end="145.53">to rendering and controller inputs.</span> <span data-start="145.53" data-end="148.23">For enhanced testing and debugging of immersive VR</span> <span data-start="148.23" data-end="151.05">experiences, a WebXR emulator extension</span> <span data-start="151.05" data-end="153.39">was created by Mozilla.</span> <span data-start="153.39" data-end="154.92">This extension enables developers</span> <span data-start="154.92" data-end="157.95">to test WebVR experiences from their desktops</span> <span data-start="157.95" data-end="160.71">with selectable XR hardware emulators.</span> <span data-start="160.71" data-end="162.42">Another announcement we made last year</span> <span data-start="162.42" data-end="165.36">was the introduction of model-viewer, a web component</span> <span data-start="165.36" data-end="169.29">that makes it easy to embed interactive 3D models to view</span> <span data-start="169.29" data-end="172.41">on the web and in AR.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="172.41" data-end="175.23">Since then, we've added features, such as advanced</span> <span data-start="175.23" data-end="179.16">controls to access and position the camera, animation support,</span> <span data-start="179.16" data-end="181.74">and integrations to view models in 3D</span> <span data-start="181.74" data-end="186.96">and AR via Quick Look on iOS and Scene Viewer on Android.</span> <span data-start="186.96" data-end="189.87">It's been exciting to see XR making waves on the web,</span> <span data-start="189.87" data-end="192.27">empowering developers to innovate and address</span> <span data-start="192.27" data-end="194.13">real market needs.</span> <span data-start="194.13" data-end="195.63">Let's hear from a few companies that</span> <span data-start="195.63" data-end="199.152">have applied some of these tools to their sites.</span> </p>
