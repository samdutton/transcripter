<p><span data-start="42.74" data-end="43.82">This is it.</span> <span data-start="43.82" data-end="47.45">Surely they'll see that this is in every design system ever,</span> <span data-start="47.45" data-end="49.95">and they'll build it into the browser</span> <span data-start="49.95" data-end="52.44">Then imagine my disappointment when we actually</span> <span data-start="52.44" data-end="54.6">got a side article and section.</span> <span data-start="54.6" data-end="55.962">They're totally fine.</span> <span data-start="55.962" data-end="57.42">They just didn't solve the problems</span> <span data-start="57.42" data-end="59.64">that I was trying to solve.</span> <span data-start="59.64" data-end="62.61">So since then, I've held onto the core belief</span> <span data-start="62.61" data-end="64.41">that HTML shouldn't be finished.</span> <span data-start="64.41" data-end="66.6">Design systems have been innovating and lighting</span> <span data-start="66.6" data-end="70.14">the path forward for HTML for a long time, and I think now,</span> <span data-start="70.14" data-end="73.16">browsers can pave those cow paths.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="73.16" data-end="75.46"><span class="speaker">Greg Whitworth</span>: And at Microsoft, we completely agree.</span> <span data-start="75.46" data-end="77.543">On the move from Edge HTML over to Chromium,</span> <span data-start="77.543" data-end="79.96">we did a full inventory of some of the goodness we thought</span> <span data-start="79.96" data-end="82.687">was in HTML and wanted to bring over to Chromium.</span> <span data-start="82.687" data-end="84.77">We reached out to our good friends over at Google,</span> <span data-start="84.77" data-end="86.44">and they completely agreed, because one</span> <span data-start="86.44" data-end="88.898">of the things we wanted to look into that we'll be covering</span> <span data-start="88.898" data-end="89.79">is form controls.</span> <span data-start="89.79" data-end="92.92">And starting up, we were with accessibility, touch,</span> <span data-start="92.92" data-end="94.87">and ultimately a fresh coat of paint,</span> <span data-start="94.87" data-end="96.412">because when we were looking at them,</span> <span data-start="96.412" data-end="98.25">they were pretty dated, as you'll see.</span> <span data-start="98.25" data-end="100.3">We'll also be covering stylability,</span> <span data-start="100.3" data-end="102.4">extending functionality, and then ultimately,</span> <span data-start="102.4" data-end="104.103">as Nicole was saying, new components.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="111.418" data-end="114.02"><span class="speaker">Greg Whitworth</span>: So as I noted, we</span> <span data-start="114.02" data-end="116.49">wanted to have the first run on accessibility.</span> <span data-start="116.49" data-end="118.38">And as we were going through them,</span> <span data-start="118.38" data-end="120.708">we also noted there was a huge need for look and feel.</span> <span data-start="120.708" data-end="122.75">So we decided to go ahead and tackle both of them</span> <span data-start="122.75" data-end="124.792">and update the look and feel, and they're planned</span> <span data-start="124.792" data-end="127.91">for both Mac and Windows.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="127.91" data-end="130"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: So we specifically wanted</span> <span data-start="130" data-end="133.42">the form elements to look like part of a matched set.</span> <span data-start="133.42" data-end="137.32">We were going for beautiful, webby, and neutral.</span> <span data-start="137.32" data-end="140.41">We hope that every design system would see a bit of themselves</span> <span data-start="140.41" data-end="142.72">in the new designs and easily imagine</span> <span data-start="142.72" data-end="145.6">how they might be adapted for their own branding.</span> <span data-start="145.6" data-end="148.16">The progress bar was not so bad.</span> <span data-start="148.16" data-end="151.09">It's a little further along than the others and a little newer.</span> <span data-start="151.09" data-end="153.34">And so we took it as a starting point</span> <span data-start="153.34" data-end="157.18">to move all of the other form controls into the future.</span> <span data-start="160.3" data-end="162.98">So if the progress bar had set the standard,</span> <span data-start="162.98" data-end="166.08">the meter needed an upgrade.</span> <span data-start="166.08" data-end="167.673">Super ugly.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="167.673" data-end="169.59">We're still working out the last little tweaks</span> <span data-start="169.59" data-end="171.63">to get the strokes exactly right,</span> <span data-start="171.63" data-end="175.18">but you can check it out on Canary and give us feedback.</span> <span data-start="175.18" data-end="178.32">This is the before, and on the right-hand side is the after.</span> <span data-start="181.27" data-end="184.21">You'll need to enable the Web Platform Controls updated UI</span> <span data-start="184.21" data-end="189.57">flag to see the latest in about://flags.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="189.57" data-end="193.45"><span class="speaker">Greg Whitworth</span>: And then we have this lovely Windows 95</span> <span data-start="193.45" data-end="197.077">draggable element here in the range, which is definitely</span> <span data-start="197.077" data-end="198.16">in the need of an upgrade.</span> <span data-start="198.16" data-end="200.4">So we gave it a more modern splash</span> <span data-start="200.4" data-end="202.77">coat of paints to flatten it up a little bit.</span> <span data-start="202.77" data-end="205.845">So hopefully it looks a lot better to you as well.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="242.76" data-end="246.1"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: I believe that you lit the path for us here.</span> <span data-start="246.1" data-end="247.33">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="247.33" data-end="249.19">On Chrome, again, we decided to experiment</span> <span data-start="249.19" data-end="251.62">with color for the selected state.</span> <span data-start="251.62" data-end="254.53">So that said, though, we share about 99%</span> <span data-start="254.53" data-end="256.12">of the code for these elements.</span> <span data-start="256.12" data-end="258.328">And so that's going to make the next steps that we're</span> <span data-start="258.328" data-end="261.602">talking about a lot easier.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="261.602" data-end="263.31"><span class="speaker">Greg Whitworth</span>: Another important aspect,</span> <span data-start="263.31" data-end="265.098">as we started off with, was accessibility.</span> <span data-start="265.098" data-end="266.64">And one of these things is, it really</span> <span data-start="266.64" data-end="268.848">doesn't matter about the input modality you're using.</span> <span data-start="268.848" data-end="271.035">You should be able to use the control in a good way.</span> <span data-start="271.035" data-end="272.41">And touch is one of those things.</span> <span data-start="272.41" data-end="276.66">As you all know, I've been using the Macs over at the booth,</span> <span data-start="276.66" data-end="279.6">and I keep touching the touch screen that isn't there.</span> <span data-start="279.6" data-end="281.35">We have the 2-in-1 Windows devices,</span> <span data-start="281.35" data-end="283.96">and so touch is very important to us.</span> <span data-start="283.96" data-end="286.79">And so we increased the hit test regions on —  here's date.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="286.79" data-end="289.29">But the thing, the control I think that shows this the most,</span> <span data-start="289.29" data-end="292.01">is the time element, which as you can see here</span> <span data-start="292.01" data-end="294.51">is the current Chromium one with those wonderful little tiny</span> <span data-start="294.51" data-end="296.34">spinners that, good luck trying to touch</span> <span data-start="296.34" data-end="297.97">those with your fingers.</span> <span data-start="297.97" data-end="300.75">We now have the similar pop-up that we have within date,</span> <span data-start="300.75" data-end="302.82">and you've got the normal touch scroll,</span> <span data-start="302.82" data-end="306.18">carousel-type feel to have a good user experience.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="330.48" data-end="332.947">Our friends at Google feel the exact same way, because</span> <span data-start="332.947" data-end="335.28">of the fact that it doesn't matter whether you're blind,</span> <span data-start="335.28" data-end="338.215">you're driving a car, you're only able to use one arm,</span> <span data-start="338.215" data-end="339.84">you're holding a baby, a cup of coffee,</span> <span data-start="339.84" data-end="342.24">you're, using a mouse, keyboard, touch, or pen.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="342.24" data-end="347.33">Everyone benefits from making your stuff inclusive.</span> <span data-start="347.33" data-end="349.22">One aspect of great accessibility</span> <span data-start="349.22" data-end="350.48">is keyboard accessibility.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="350.48" data-end="353.09"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: Yeah, and the previous Chromium color picker</span> <span data-start="353.09" data-end="356.75">didn't have keyboard access to all parts of the control.</span> <span data-start="356.75" data-end="358.855">In particular, the color well wasn't accessible.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="362.61" data-end="363.95"><span class="speaker">Greg Whitworth</span>:  — color control here,</span> <span data-start="363.95" data-end="365.783">but it's also the keyboard navigation thing.</span> <span data-start="365.783" data-end="368.762">It's actually true, also, of the Apple-native one as well.</span> <span data-start="368.762" data-end="370.97">But we went ahead and did all of the keyboard support</span> <span data-start="370.97" data-end="372.63">that any user would expect.</span> <span data-start="372.63" data-end="374.54">So if you're navigating this with a keyboard,</span> <span data-start="374.54" data-end="376.8">everything works, including the color well.</span> <span data-start="376.8" data-end="379.07">And we also have keyboard modifier keys</span> <span data-start="379.07" data-end="380.27">that use Control or Command.</span> <span data-start="380.27" data-end="382.94">You jump 10 color values, so that you also</span> <span data-start="382.94" data-end="385.153">get the same speed and intuitiveness</span> <span data-start="385.153" data-end="387.32">that you would with a mouse, rather than just having</span> <span data-start="387.32" data-end="389.237">to go every single pixel value, which would be</span> <span data-start="389.237" data-end="390.59">really annoying and monotonous.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="390.59" data-end="391.55"><span class="speaker">Nicole Sullivan</span>: And this is the kind of thought</span> <span data-start="391.55" data-end="393.53">that Greg's team really puts into these things,</span> <span data-start="393.53" data-end="395.3">because it would be super annoying to have</span> <span data-start="395.3" data-end="397.97">to go color by color by color by a keyboard.</span> <span data-start="397.97" data-end="403.17">And so being able to make that 10-pixel jump is great.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="403.17" data-end="405.48"><span class="speaker">Greg Whitworth</span>: So Edge also had high-contrast support.</span> <span data-start="405.48" data-end="406.82">It's something we value.</span> <span data-start="406.82" data-end="409.402">And one misnomer, also, is, it's called high-contrast,</span> <span data-start="409.402" data-end="411.36">but it's actually a color theme a user can set,</span> <span data-start="411.36" data-end="413.193">because people actually do set low contrasts</span> <span data-start="413.193" data-end="414.503">as well in different scenarios.</span> <span data-start="414.503" data-end="415.92">But here, we're showing that these</span> <span data-start="415.92" data-end="418.08">now in Chromium work by default.

<p><span data-start="527.74" data-end="530.69">So ultimately, this is what it comes down to — </span> <span data-start="530.69" data-end="533.89">and hopefully you heard in Yoav and Chris's talk — </span> <span data-start="533.89" data-end="536.08">that we want to build stuff you use.</span> <span data-start="536.08" data-end="538.57">We don't spend all these days doing this stuff for you</span> <span data-start="538.57" data-end="540.22">all to throw it all away.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="886.94" data-end="889.76">And so we started looking into raw value and other solutions</span> <span data-start="889.76" data-end="893.04">for preserving the characters typed by the user.</span> <span data-start="893.04" data-end="895.85">We want controls to also work for frameworks.</span> <span data-start="895.85" data-end="898.2">I don't think we have the end solution there,</span> <span data-start="898.2" data-end="899.24">but we're looking at it.</span> <span data-start="901.843" data-end="903.76">We also asked you which form elements give you</span> <span data-start="903.76" data-end="905.68">the most frustration.</span> <span data-start="905.68" data-end="909.16">And you really couldn't have been more clear.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="909.16" data-end="911.47">You kind of hate the select element.</span> <span data-start="911.47" data-end="913.45">You hate it!</span> <span data-start="913.45" data-end="917.23">42.7% are the most frustrated with the select control.</span> <span data-start="917.23" data-end="919.9">Let's just see —  how many people here would put select</span> <span data-start="919.9" data-end="921.73">at the top of their list?</span> <span data-start="921.73" data-end="922.23">Yep.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="922.23" data-end="923.95"><span class="speaker">Greg Whitworth</span>: It feels like, actually, a little bit higher</span> <span data-start="923.95" data-end="924.45">than 40%.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="943.712" data-end="945.67"><span class="speaker">Greg Whitworth</span>: So since the select</span> <span data-start="945.67" data-end="949.123">was by far the winner of being the worst,</span> <span data-start="949.123" data-end="950.29">we decided to dig into that.</span> <span data-start="950.29" data-end="952.44">We did another survey that had a bunch of different questions</span> <span data-start="952.44" data-end="954.523">that started digging into use cases and everything</span> <span data-start="954.523" data-end="955.44">about the select.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="959.93" data-end="962.263"><span class="speaker">Greg Whitworth</span>: It's very useful, because ultimately, we</span> <span data-start="962.263" data-end="964.347">ended up having a bunch of questions that ended up</span> <span data-start="964.347" data-end="965.47">in these various buckets.</span> <span data-start="965.47" data-end="968.47">And so overwhelmingly, styling is the largest pain point</span> <span data-start="968.47" data-end="970.95">that we should go try to tackle first, then behavior</span> <span data-start="970.95" data-end="972.8">and extensibility and content adjustments.</span> <span data-start="972.8" data-end="974.68">One aspect I would like to call out —  again,</span> <span data-start="974.68" data-end="976.847">why we had the individual questions, because earlier</span> <span data-start="976.847" data-end="979.097">we were talking about, oh, do you want to extend them?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="979.097" data-end="980.347">And a lot of people said that.</span> <span data-start="980.347" data-end="982.055">But when we were digging into the select,</span> <span data-start="982.055" data-end="983.95">because each control has a different meaning</span> <span data-start="983.95" data-end="987.07">of extensibility, the select —  the number one,</span> <span data-start="987.07" data-end="989.23">if you take out just the top issue that people</span> <span data-start="989.23" data-end="991.3">had in this bucket, which is being</span> <span data-start="991.3" data-end="993.61">able to provide a good user experience while searching</span> <span data-start="993.61" data-end="997.018">the select, if you take that out, this is nonexistent.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1114.85" data-end="1118.76">Display locking is available in origin trial right now,</span> <span data-start="1118.76" data-end="1122.38">and it unlocks a lot of different features.</span> <span data-start="1122.38" data-end="1124.27">It allows you to batch rendering updates</span> <span data-start="1124.27" data-end="1126.77">to avoid paying the performance costs for — </span> <span data-start="1126.77" data-end="1130.27">yeah, it's really good for large amounts of DOM.</span> <span data-start="1130.27" data-end="1133.648">It also means that locked sub-trees are not</span> <span data-start="1133.648" data-end="1135.19">rendered immediately, which means you</span> <span data-start="1135.19" data-end="1137.65">can keep more stuff in the DOM.</span> <span data-start="1137.65" data-end="1140.46">That's great, because it becomes searchable both by Find</span> <span data-start="1140.46" data-end="1144.31">in Page as well as by assistive technologies.</span> <span data-start="1144.31" data-end="1145.06">So let's be clear.</span> <span data-start="1145.06" data-end="1146.65">This isn't UI table view.</span> <span data-start="1146.65" data-end="1147.91">I'm sorry, Pete.</span> <span data-start="1147.91" data-end="1149.44">I hope we'll get there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1149.44" data-end="1152.08">But it is definitely a step in that direction.</span> <span data-start="1152.08" data-end="1153.55">It's IN origin trial right now.</span> <span data-start="1153.55" data-end="1154.883">Please, we'd love your feedback.</span> <span data-start="1157.27" data-end="1159.91">We've also been working on the toggle switch, which</span> <span data-start="1159.91" data-end="1163.42">allows developers to semantically express the on/off</span> <span data-start="1163.42" data-end="1165.88">state.</span> <span data-start="1165.88" data-end="1167.5">We started out with a ton of research</span> <span data-start="1167.5" data-end="1170.89">into how other design systems handle toggle behavior.</span> <span data-start="1170.89" data-end="1173.8">We coded a prototype —  you can try it, it's on GitHub — </span> <span data-start="1173.8" data-end="1177.28">and we used it to drive out new low-level APIs and better</span> <span data-start="1177.28" data-end="1180.24">accessibility.</span> <span data-start="1180.24" data-end="1183.18">So three low-level APIs and improvements in particular</span> <span data-start="1183.18" data-end="1186.45">are form-associated custom elements, custom element</span> <span data-start="1186.45" data-end="1191.305">accessibility, and focusable custom elements.</span> </p>
