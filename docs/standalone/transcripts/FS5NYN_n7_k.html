<p><span data-start="13.8" data-end="15.39">Imagine that we're in the subway,</span> <span data-start="15.39" data-end="16.74">waiting for the next train.</span> <span data-start="16.74" data-end="20.19">In the meantime, we open our favorite Wikipedia app</span> <span data-start="20.19" data-end="22.74">and decide to learn more about cheese.</span> <span data-start="22.74" data-end="26.52">Just around the time it gets tasty, our train arrives.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="26.52" data-end="29.09">We get into the car and depart.</span> <span data-start="29.09" data-end="32.49">While sitting there, we decide to continue reading more,</span> <span data-start="32.49" data-end="34.02">but we have a poor signal.</span> <span data-start="34.02" data-end="37.24">We start angrily rage-clicking on the links,</span> <span data-start="37.24" data-end="38.55">but it doesn't help.</span> <span data-start="38.55" data-end="42.17">It just makes the situation even more frustrating.</span> <span data-start="42.17" data-end="45.24">Let us see how we can use prefetching for fewer</span> <span data-start="45.24" data-end="47.73">rage-clicking experiences.</span> <span data-start="47.73" data-end="50.64">First, let us explain what is prefetching.</span> <span data-start="50.64" data-end="54.31">Imagine a user is reading the cheese article from before.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="54.31" data-end="56.49">In the background, we can download and cache</span> <span data-start="56.49" data-end="59.28">the content associated with other pages</span> <span data-start="59.28" data-end="61.44">that there are likely to be needed next,</span> <span data-start="61.44" data-end="63.78">so when they perform a navigation,</span> <span data-start="63.78" data-end="66.57">they can have an instant experience.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="66.57" data-end="69.04">There are different prefetching strategies.</span> <span data-start="69.04" data-end="73.12">For example, we can prefetch all the assets in the app,</span> <span data-start="73.12" data-end="76.86">prefetch only the assets associated with visible links,</span> <span data-start="76.86" data-end="80.61">initiate prefetching when the user's cursor is above link,</span> <span data-start="80.61" data-end="84.3">or apply predictive prefetching.</span> <span data-start="84.3" data-end="85.92">Predictive prefetching is a technique</span> <span data-start="85.92" data-end="89.81">that uses methods from data analytics and machine learning</span> <span data-start="89.81" data-end="92.22">to provides a data-driven approach.</span> <span data-start="92.22" data-end="94.27">In order to use predictive prefetching,</span> <span data-start="94.27" data-end="97.2">we need an app usage report that we</span> <span data-start="97.2" data-end="100.22">can feed into a machine-learning model, which</span> <span data-start="100.22" data-end="103.98">enhances the app by providing a predictive experience.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="103.98" data-end="107.67">Microsoft's Office 365 uses predictive prefetching</span> <span data-start="107.67" data-end="111.48">with Angular to improve the responsiveness of their lazily</span> <span data-start="111.48" data-end="113.01">loaded components.</span> <span data-start="113.01" data-end="115.35">YouTube is predictively prefetching content</span> <span data-start="115.35" data-end="118.59">for instant user experiences.</span> <span data-start="118.59" data-end="120.8">But you don't have to be Microsoft or Google</span> <span data-start="120.8" data-end="122.67">to take advantage of this technique.</span> <span data-start="122.67" data-end="125.21">Guess.js is a library that adds predictive prefetching</span> <span data-start="125.21" data-end="128.72">support for apps using popular frameworks.</span> <span data-start="128.72" data-end="131.03">And you can take advantage of it today.</span> <span data-start="131.03" data-end="133.58">It tracks the possible navigations from a page</span> <span data-start="133.58" data-end="136.16">and prefectures only the JavaScript that</span> <span data-start="136.16" data-end="138.23">is likely to be needed next.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="138.23" data-end="140.09">Now, let me tell you the story of Naveed,</span> <span data-start="140.09" data-end="143.09">who introduced predictive prefetching with Guess.js</span> <span data-start="143.09" data-end="144.23">to his web app.</span> <span data-start="144.23" data-end="147.68">Naveed is building a popular web app with tens of thousands</span> <span data-start="147.68" data-end="150.83">of users for finding jobs in Pakistan.</span> <span data-start="150.83" data-end="153.17">He developed his web app with Angular</span> <span data-start="153.17" data-end="155.96">using the Angular Router and CLI.</span> <span data-start="155.96" data-end="158.06">Let us compare how three different prefetching</span> <span data-start="158.06" data-end="161.27">strategies would perform on Naveed's website.</span> <span data-start="161.27" data-end="164.45">If he was prefetching all the modules in the app,</span> <span data-start="164.45" data-end="167.84">this will have consumed 2.56 megabytes</span> <span data-start="167.84" data-end="172.22">of data for a single user visiting the home page.</span> <span data-start="172.22" data-end="174.92">With a more efficient strategy, if he was only</span> <span data-start="174.92" data-end="177.57">prefetching the visible links on the page,</span> <span data-start="177.57" data-end="181.85">this will have consumed 1.22 megabytes of data.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="181.85" data-end="187.37">With Guess.js, Naveed's website consumes only 0.18 megabytes</span> <span data-start="187.37" data-end="191.31">of data for prefetching when the user visits the home page.</span> <span data-start="191.31" data-end="195.02">This is 7% of the traffic consumed by the most aggressive</span> <span data-start="195.02" data-end="196.06">strategy.</span> <span data-start="196.06" data-end="198.29">With the tens of thousands of users</span> <span data-start="198.29" data-end="200.75">visiting Naveed's websites daily,</span> <span data-start="200.75" data-end="202.97">he saves gigabytes of traffic.</span> <span data-start="202.97" data-end="207.56">The prefetching of Guest.js comes with over 90% accuracy.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="207.56" data-end="210.29">Combined with prefetching on mouse-over,</span> <span data-start="210.29" data-end="212.12">it can provide instant experiences</span> <span data-start="212.12" data-end="214.91">for all the users of his website,</span> <span data-start="214.91" data-end="217.03">while saving their data.</span> <span data-start="217.03" data-end="220.31">Additionally, Guess.js adapts its prefetching algorithm</span> <span data-start="220.31" data-end="221.99">to the user's connection speeds.</span> <span data-start="221.99" data-end="223.76">It performs more aggressive prefetching</span> <span data-start="223.76" data-end="226.82">for users on fast network, and less aggressive</span> <span data-start="226.82" data-end="228.9">for users on a slower network.</span> <span data-start="228.9" data-end="232.01">Guess.js prefetches the individual JavaScript chunks,</span> <span data-start="232.01" data-end="235.1">depending on their likelihoods to be used.</span> <span data-start="235.1" data-end="238.04">It calculates the probabilities for all the chunks</span> <span data-start="238.04" data-end="241.34">to be needed at build time so its payload could</span> <span data-start="241.34" data-end="243.36">be reduced to the minimum.</span> <span data-start="243.36" data-end="246.05">And finally, it does not block the main thread,</span> <span data-start="246.05" data-end="249.95">since it performs prefetching only when the browser is idle.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="249.95" data-end="254.45">Today you can use Guest.js with Angular, Next.js, Gatsby,</span> <span data-start="254.45" data-end="256.37">and Next.js.</span> <span data-start="256.37" data-end="257.959">The important takeaways from today</span> <span data-start="257.959" data-end="261.5">are that predictive prefetching can speed up page navigation</span> <span data-start="261.5" data-end="263.63">and improve the user experience.</span> <span data-start="263.63" data-end="267.1">By doing so, it will increase user satisfaction</span> <span data-start="267.1" data-end="269.3">and reduce their data usage.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="269.3" data-end="272.3">If you're using Angular or a popular React or Vue</span> <span data-start="272.3" data-end="276.63">meta-framework, you can take advantage of Guess.js today.</span> <span data-start="276.63" data-end="278.06">You can learn more about Guess.js</span> <span data-start="278.06" data-end="281.27">and predictive prefetching on Web.dev.</span> <span data-start="281.27" data-end="282.56">Thanks for watching.</span> <span data-start="282.56" data-end="286.21">[MUSIC PLAYING]</span> </p>
