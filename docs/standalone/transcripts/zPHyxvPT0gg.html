</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="192.17" data-end="193.78"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: So back in 2008, Chrome</span> <span data-start="193.78" data-end="196.49">launched with process isolation, an architecture that</span> <span data-start="196.49" data-end="199.72">put each tab in its own operating system process,</span> <span data-start="199.72" data-end="203.26">making Chrome exceptionally stable, but also exceptionally</span> <span data-start="203.26" data-end="204.4">secure.</span> <span data-start="204.4" data-end="206.86">The process boundary acts as a line of defense in the event</span> <span data-start="206.86" data-end="209.23">malicious code is able to exploit a bug</span> <span data-start="209.23" data-end="211.81">and attempt to read data from another tab.</span> <span data-start="211.81" data-end="213.73">Over the past 10 years, this model</span> <span data-start="213.73" data-end="215.68">has become the industry standard.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="215.68" data-end="217.84"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: This year, desktop Chrome browsers</span> <span data-start="217.84" data-end="221.89">took this model further with the launch of Site Isolation.</span> <span data-start="221.89" data-end="225.49">So now, Chrome ensures that even within a single tab,</span> <span data-start="225.49" data-end="228.71">content from different Domains is isolated.</span> <span data-start="228.71" data-end="230.59">So in this example, in the iframe,</span> <span data-start="230.59" data-end="233.77">this news site is using a display ad,</span> <span data-start="233.77" data-end="235.6">and it's running in a different process</span> <span data-start="235.6" data-end="237.52">than the rest of the page.</span> <span data-start="237.52" data-end="239.65">We've wanted to extend process isolation this way</span> <span data-start="239.65" data-end="242.5">for some time, and we think it's an important protection</span> <span data-start="242.5" data-end="244.019">for the web.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="244.019" data-end="246.31"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: Now we've also been continuing our efforts</span> <span data-start="246.31" data-end="250.84">to encourage developers to use HTTPS for all web traffic.</span> <span data-start="250.84" data-end="252.93">This ensures that the content of a site</span> <span data-start="252.93" data-end="255.43">isn't maliciously modified while in transit,</span> <span data-start="255.43" data-end="259.07">and also that user data is transferred securely.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="259.07" data-end="260.57"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: In the latest Chrome,</span> <span data-start="260.57" data-end="264.98">we mark pages as not secure when they're served from HTTP.</span> <span data-start="264.98" data-end="267.62">And when the user begins to interact with form fields,</span> <span data-start="267.62" data-end="272.2">we further emphasize the point with a stronger warning.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="272.2" data-end="275.14"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: The HTTPS movement is a collaborative effort,</span> <span data-start="275.14" data-end="277.27">with organizations like Let's Encrypt</span> <span data-start="277.27" data-end="279.82">playing a big role in lowering the barriers to upgrading</span> <span data-start="279.82" data-end="280.75">sites.</span> <span data-start="280.75" data-end="282.13">And it's working.</span> <span data-start="282.13" data-end="285.52">In Chrome itself, we're seeing big shifts to HTTPS.</span> <span data-start="285.52" data-end="290.47">And over 80% of the top 100 sites are now all HTTPS.</span> <span data-start="290.47" data-end="292.48">We think this is actually a major accomplishment</span> <span data-start="292.48" data-end="295.669">because the web is such a massive ecosystem.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="523.559" data-end="525.54"><span class="speaker">Ben Galbraith</span>: It's because since 2001, sites</span> <span data-start="525.54" data-end="528.18">use an average eight times more JavaScript</span> <span data-start="528.18" data-end="529.652">than they did before.</span> <span data-start="529.652" data-end="531.36">And that's a problem, because in addition</span> <span data-start="531.36" data-end="533.22">to having to be downloaded, all this code</span> <span data-start="533.22" data-end="536.96">needs to be compiled by the browser and executed.</span> <span data-start="536.96" data-end="539.07">And with mobile, many of the devices</span> <span data-start="539.07" data-end="540.54">that our users are using are slower</span> <span data-start="540.54" data-end="542.17">than they've been before.</span> <span data-start="542.17" data-end="545.79">And so increasingly, performance can include the CPU</span> <span data-start="545.79" data-end="546.84">as a bottleneck.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="546.84" data-end="548.34"><span class="speaker">Dion Almaer</span>: Now we've created tools</span> <span data-start="548.34" data-end="550.2">like Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights,</span> <span data-start="550.2" data-end="552">and the Chrome User Experience Report</span> <span data-start="552" data-end="554.85">that can provide deep insights into your site's performance</span> <span data-start="554.85" data-end="556.675">and how it can be improved.</span> </p>
