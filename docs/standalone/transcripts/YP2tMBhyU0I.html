<p><span data-start="54.96" data-end="56.94">And they're typically, like, single-page apps.</span> <span data-start="56.94" data-end="60.79">But this applies to any website that uses front-end JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="60.79" data-end="63.06">And they might be, say, powered with Ajax or web</span> <span data-start="63.06" data-end="65.26">sockets for content.</span> <span data-start="65.26" data-end="67.87">And lastly, what do we mean by indexable by Search?</span> <span data-start="67.87" data-end="72.43">Well, by indexable, I mean the content can be understood.</span> <span data-start="72.43" data-end="74.59">And by Search, we mean Google Search.</span> </p>

</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="217.56" data-end="220.32"><span class="speaker">Tom Greenaway</span>: Well, when we fetched a web page from a URL</span> <span data-start="220.32" data-end="223.2">and it was a traditional website, that web page was</span> <span data-start="223.2" data-end="225.45">complete when it arrived.</span> <span data-start="225.45" data-end="229.65">And we called this the rendering of the page</span> <span data-start="229.65" data-end="231.355">or the construction of the HTML.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="267.36" data-end="268.85"><span class="speaker">Tom Greenaway</span>: Yeah, it's a good question.</span> <span data-start="268.85" data-end="270.33">Basically, there's now a renderer</span> <span data-start="270.33" data-end="271.78">inside the process step.</span> <span data-start="271.78" data-end="274.71">So more specifically, we have a version of Chrome</span> <span data-start="274.71" data-end="278.01">that opens the content of the page and runs some JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="278.01" data-end="280.74">And then it spits out the final HTML.</span> <span data-start="280.74" data-end="283.62">But we also have a queue as well, which is quite important.</span> <span data-start="283.62" data-end="287.01">And that leads into this next point, which John Wheeler and I</span> <span data-start="287.01" data-end="288.78">revealed at I/O earlier this year, which</span> <span data-start="288.78" data-end="290.79">is that, in a nutshell, the rendering</span> <span data-start="290.79" data-end="293.28">of JavaScript-powered websites in Google Search</span> <span data-start="293.28" data-end="295.8">is actually deferred until Googlebot</span> <span data-start="295.8" data-end="298.515">has the resources available to process that content.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="304.794" data-end="306.21"><span class="speaker">Tom Greenaway</span>: Well, it could take</span> <span data-start="306.21" data-end="309.9">minutes or maybe an hour or maybe even days or up to a week</span> <span data-start="309.9" data-end="312.48">before the render is actually completed.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="374.045" data-end="375.42"><span class="speaker">Tom Greenaway</span>: Well, here you can</span> <span data-start="375.42" data-end="378.45">see how a server identifies that the device requesting the page</span> <span data-start="378.45" data-end="380.11">is a user browser.</span> <span data-start="380.11" data-end="384.134">And then it serves a payload of HTML and JavaScript</span> <span data-start="384.134" data-end="385.8">that gets rendered on the client, right?</span> <span data-start="385.8" data-end="388.05">So that's basic stuff.</span> <span data-start="388.05" data-end="390.15">But when a crawler like Googlebot makes a request,</span> <span data-start="390.15" data-end="392.91">the server sends a different payload.</span> <span data-start="392.91" data-end="395.64">And instead of sending the HTML JavaScript directly</span> <span data-start="395.64" data-end="397.2">to the browser — </span> <span data-start="397.2" data-end="399.09">or in this case, the crawler — </span> <span data-start="399.09" data-end="401.13">we send what is normally sent to the browser,</span> <span data-start="401.13" data-end="404.02">but we send it to the dynamic rendering service.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="404.02" data-end="406.96">And we run the payload through that service.</span> <span data-start="406.96" data-end="409.17">So the dynamic renderer then spits out</span> <span data-start="409.17" data-end="412.609">a completely statically rendered HTML payload for the crawlers.</span> </p>

</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="414.96" data-end="417.168"><span class="speaker">Tom Greenaway</span>: And to be clear, that dynamic renderer</span> <span data-start="417.168" data-end="418.65">could be an external service or it</span> <span data-start="418.65" data-end="421.08">could be running on the same web server infrastructure.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="421.08" data-end="421.56"><span class="speaker">Martin Splitt</span>: All right.</span> <span data-start="421.56" data-end="422.4">Yeah, that makes sense.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="423.233" data-end="425.31"><span class="speaker">Martin Splitt</span>: I guess, for this kind of stuff,</span> <span data-start="425.31" data-end="428.85">you can use tools such as — </span> <span data-start="428.85" data-end="430.92">Puppeteer is one that you mentioned already.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="430.92" data-end="431.07"><span class="speaker">Tom Greenaway</span>: Yeah.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="431.07" data-end="431.58"><span class="speaker">Martin Splitt</span>: But you could also</span> <span data-start="431.58" data-end="434.52">probably use Rendertron, which is a higher-level abstraction.</span> <span data-start="434.52" data-end="437.1">Puppeteer is basically an NPM module that you install.</span> <span data-start="437.1" data-end="440.22">And that remote controls or programmatically</span> <span data-start="440.22" data-end="442.11">controls a Chrome instance that runs</span> <span data-start="442.11" data-end="443.73">headlessly, which is great.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="443.73" data-end="445.75">But I'd like something more high level.</span> <span data-start="445.75" data-end="447.45">And I think Rendertron steps in there,</span> <span data-start="447.45" data-end="449.79">where you basically just have the server running, which</span> <span data-start="449.79" data-end="452.91">is a Rendertron server that uses Puppeteer to steer that.</span> <span data-start="452.91" data-end="454.53">And you give it a URL to render.</span> <span data-start="454.53" data-end="457.009">And you get the rendered static HTML back.</span> <span data-start="457.009" data-end="457.8">That's pretty cool.</span> <span data-start="457.8" data-end="458.3">OK.</span> <span data-start="458.3" data-end="460.29">It's fantastic.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="460.29" data-end="462.35">I guess you can also deploy that pretty easily.</span> <span data-start="462.35" data-end="463.89">I think there's this thing called</span> <span data-start="463.89" data-end="465.51">Google Cloud Platform that's probably</span> <span data-start="465.51" data-end="466.659">pretty easy to deploy too.</span> <span data-start="466.659" data-end="469.2">But I guess you can also deploy it pretty much anywhere else,</span> <span data-start="469.2" data-end="469.74">right?</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="469.74" data-end="470.91"><span class="speaker">Tom Greenaway</span>: Do you have an example?</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="470.91" data-end="472.785"><span class="speaker">Martin Splitt</span>: I do have an example actually.</span> <span data-start="472.785" data-end="476.22">So there's a NPM module that is called the Rendertron</span> <span data-start="476.22" data-end="477.46">middleware.</span> <span data-start="477.46" data-end="480.24">So if you are using, let's say, for instance, Express.js,</span> <span data-start="480.24" data-end="482.37">you can use that as the middleware.</span> <span data-start="482.37" data-end="485.04">But what you're doing here is basically just — </span> <span data-start="485.04" data-end="488.1">first step, you require it.</span> <span data-start="488.1" data-end="489.99">You need to get that into your project.</span> <span data-start="489.99" data-end="492.36">And then what you're doing is you basically</span> <span data-start="492.36" data-end="494.7">configure it to do the right thing for you.</span> <span data-start="494.7" data-end="498.75">In this case, we want to specifically jump the rendering</span> <span data-start="498.75" data-end="500.61">pipeline of the Googlebot.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="500.61" data-end="503.73">Rendertron, by default, doesn't do prerendering for Googlebot,</span> <span data-start="503.73" data-end="505.93">because the Googlebot does run JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="505.93" data-end="508.8">But we want to get the advantage here anyways.</span> <span data-start="508.8" data-end="515.28">So we can just use the preconfigured and prebuilt list</span> <span data-start="515.28" data-end="517.26">of render agents that they are rendering for</span> <span data-start="517.26" data-end="519.33">and add Googlebot in there.</span> <span data-start="519.33" data-end="521.309">And then once we have that configuration ready</span> <span data-start="521.309" data-end="523.47">and have imported it, we can go on</span> <span data-start="523.47" data-end="526.23">to actually use it in our application middleware stack.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="526.23" data-end="529.86">So we can basically point it to the running server somewhere</span> <span data-start="529.86" data-end="534.49">and say, for all these user agent patterns, prerender.</span> <span data-start="534.49" data-end="536.41">By the way, now that I have got you here — </span> <span data-start="536.41" data-end="539.83">because you never respond to emails timely, which is fine.</span> <span data-start="539.83" data-end="541.95">Neither do I —  no offense.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="541.95" data-end="544.19">And Chrome Dev Sum is a big event.</span> <span data-start="544.19" data-end="548.455">So this rendering does cost a bit of resources.</span> <span data-start="548.455" data-end="550.24">So I'm wondering, is there any way</span> <span data-start="550.24" data-end="552.972">to figure out what Googlebot —  like, what does Rendertron</span> <span data-start="552.972" data-end="554.68">really do to figure out what's Googlebot?</span> <span data-start="554.68" data-end="556.3">And how can it verify that is really</span> <span data-start="556.3" data-end="558.806">is Googlebot and not just pretending to be Googlebot?</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="560.71" data-end="562.168"><span class="speaker">Tom Greenaway</span>:  — the easiest way is</span> <span data-start="562.168" data-end="564.46">to do user agent sniffing for the Googlebot string.</span> <span data-start="564.46" data-end="566.477">And here's an example with the mobile user</span> <span data-start="566.477" data-end="567.31">agent for Googlebot.</span> <span data-start="567.31" data-end="568.44">[WHISTLING]</span> <span data-start="568.44" data-end="571.6">But you might want to do this for other services</span> <span data-start="571.6" data-end="573.85">as well that you want to serve prerendered content to,</span> <span data-start="573.85" data-end="575.89">like social media services.</span> <span data-start="575.89" data-end="579.839">And also, for Googlebot, you can do, additionally, a reverse DNS</span> <span data-start="579.839" data-end="581.38">look-up, to confirm that it really is</span> <span data-start="581.38" data-end="584.012">coming from the Google servers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="584.012" data-end="585.97">And like I said, this is the mobile user agent.</span> <span data-start="585.97" data-end="589.102">So you can detect the desktop user agent as well.</span> <span data-start="589.102" data-end="591.435">And that URL will give you a list of all the different — </span> </p>

<p><span data-start="798.48" data-end="800.521"><span class="speaker">Martin Splitt</span>: So you have this really nice flow.</span> <span data-start="800.521" data-end="803.04">So let's say, someone in your company or agency</span> <span data-start="803.04" data-end="805.422">or wherever has access to Search Console.</span> <span data-start="805.422" data-end="807.63">I don't have access to Search Console as a developer,</span> <span data-start="807.63" data-end="810.54">normally, because I have so much other things to worry</span> <span data-start="810.54" data-end="812.34">about really.</span> <span data-start="812.34" data-end="816.66">And then someone finds an issue through one of the reports.</span> <span data-start="816.66" data-end="819.84">So how do they get this information to me?</span> <span data-start="819.84" data-end="821.64">Well, one way of doing so is, basically,</span> <span data-start="821.64" data-end="825.24">they can just go and see this issue from the Reports page,</span> <span data-start="825.24" data-end="826.92">where —  there's a bunch of samples here.</span> <span data-start="826.92" data-end="829.32">In this case, the content is wider than the screen.</span> <span data-start="829.32" data-end="832.47">And in the second stage of this, they can basically</span> <span data-start="832.47" data-end="833.55">just say, all right.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="833.55" data-end="835.65">So our developers might be an external developer.</span> <span data-start="835.65" data-end="837.733">We don't want to give them access to all the data.</span> <span data-start="837.733" data-end="839.647">So we share this particular issue with them.</span> <span data-start="839.647" data-end="840.48">And they get a link.</span> <span data-start="840.48" data-end="842.105">They don't have to sign in or anything.</span> <span data-start="842.105" data-end="844.71">They can just use the link that is shared here</span> <span data-start="844.71" data-end="846.9">to see what the issue is, get access</span> <span data-start="846.9" data-end="849.3">to the documentation that explains what the problem is</span> <span data-start="849.3" data-end="850.77">and how to fix it.</span> <span data-start="850.77" data-end="853.33">And then, last but not least, when I, as a developer,</span> <span data-start="853.33" data-end="854.76">then go, I fixed this — </span> </p>
<p><span data-start="854.76" data-end="856.762">I have this under control — </span> <span data-start="856.762" data-end="858.22">we know that that's often not true.</span> <span data-start="858.22" data-end="862.36">So what Search Console offers us is this Validate Fix button.</span> <span data-start="862.36" data-end="864.99">So if I'm like, Tom, I gotcha.</span> <span data-start="864.99" data-end="865.78">I fixed this.</span> <span data-start="865.78" data-end="868.77">You or I can press this button and go,</span> <span data-start="868.77" data-end="870.06">I got you in 10 minutes.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1040.21" data-end="1041.71"><span class="speaker">Tom Greenaway</span>: That's a good answer.</span> <span data-start="1041.71" data-end="1043.66">Yeah, OK.</span> <span data-start="1043.66" data-end="1045.19">More than 0.</span> <span data-start="1045.19" data-end="1046.325">Yeah, exactly.</span> <span data-start="1046.325" data-end="1047.95">Now, we might forget that some of these</span> <span data-start="1047.95" data-end="1050.92">are relatively recent features, like advanced object literals</span> <span data-start="1050.92" data-end="1053.605">or const definitions, backwards, and variable substitution.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1053.605" data-end="1055.03"><span class="speaker">Martin Splitt</span>: Yeah, you use them every day.</span> <span data-start="1055.03" data-end="1055.27">Why — </span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1055.27" data-end="1056.2"><span class="speaker">Tom Greenaway</span>: Yeah, exactly.</span> <span data-start="1056.2" data-end="1056.699">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="1056.699" data-end="1060.13">So one way to deal with this, if you need a solution,</span> <span data-start="1060.13" data-end="1061.81">is to use something like Babel, which</span> <span data-start="1061.81" data-end="1067.12">allows you to transpile ES6 code down to ES5 automatically.</span> <span data-start="1067.12" data-end="1070.3">And you can easily compile a set of files or a directory</span> <span data-start="1070.3" data-end="1072.91">and compile it into a single file for serving.</span> <span data-start="1072.91" data-end="1075.972">And using presets, you can also detect a minimum browser</span> <span data-start="1075.972" data-end="1077.43">version and use that as a baseline.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1077.43" data-end="1077.75"><span class="speaker">Martin Splitt</span>: Oh, right.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1077.75" data-end="1080.41"><span class="speaker">Tom Greenaway</span>: So you can ensure that, like, ES6 features</span> <span data-start="1080.41" data-end="1083.05">and ES6 code go to browsers that can support it.</span> <span data-start="1083.05" data-end="1085.866">And then browsers that can't get the ES5 transpiled code.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1085.866" data-end="1087.49"><span class="speaker">Martin Splitt</span>: Right, that makes sense.</span> <span data-start="1087.49" data-end="1087.99">OK.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1149.39" data-end="1149.8"><span class="speaker">Tom Greenaway</span>: So, Martin, do you</span> <span data-start="1149.8" data-end="1151.75">have any suggestions for how we can substitute</span> <span data-start="1151.75" data-end="1153.11">for some of these things?</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1153.11" data-end="1154.485"><span class="speaker">Martin Splitt</span>: So I think, if you</span> <span data-start="1154.485" data-end="1157.99">look at things like the web components</span> <span data-start="1157.99" data-end="1160.54">and a few of these features, like intersection, observe,</span> <span data-start="1160.54" data-end="1163.24">and all these things, I guess polyfills is a good way,</span> <span data-start="1163.24" data-end="1165.112">once you've already done your homework</span> <span data-start="1165.112" data-end="1166.57">and did the progressive enhancement</span> <span data-start="1166.57" data-end="1169.66">or graceful degradation at least.</span> <span data-start="1169.66" data-end="1171.91">But the problem with polyfills, I feel at least,</span> <span data-start="1171.91" data-end="1175.68">is that there is a bit of a risk to ship dead code to people — </span> <span data-start="1175.68" data-end="1178.33">like, give them a bunch of stuff over the network which,</span> <span data-start="1178.33" data-end="1180.91">depending on where they are and what plan they're on,</span> <span data-start="1180.91" data-end="1184.075">might be actually pretty expensive and time-consuming.</span> <span data-start="1184.075" data-end="1185.2">So you want to reduce that.</span> <span data-start="1185.2" data-end="1188.69">And actually, I really like this library called Polyfill.io.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1188.69" data-end="1192.28">So Polyfill.io basically sniffs on the user</span> <span data-start="1192.28" data-end="1196.61">agent of the person requesting or the browser requesting it.</span> <span data-start="1196.61" data-end="1198.64">So if the crawler comes by and there's like,</span> <span data-start="1198.64" data-end="1201.34">ooh, this is a Googlebot crawler, Chrome 41 — </span> <span data-start="1201.34" data-end="1204.26">so I give them a bunch of stuff that the normal user</span> <span data-start="1204.26" data-end="1207.95">on a more recent Chrome or Firefox or Edge or whatever</span> <span data-start="1207.95" data-end="1209">doesn't need.</span> <span data-start="1209" data-end="1211.9">So basically, it tries to give you the right amount of code</span> <span data-start="1211.9" data-end="1213.41">that you need to make this work.</span> <span data-start="1213.41" data-end="1215.06">So that's pretty fantastic, I think.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1224.157" data-end="1225.49"><span class="speaker">Tom Greenaway</span>: Yeah, definitely.</span> <span data-start="1225.49" data-end="1226.906">If you check out caniuse.com, it's</span> <span data-start="1226.906" data-end="1228.573">a great resource for this sort of thing,</span> <span data-start="1228.573" data-end="1230.28">because you can check, like, the features</span> <span data-start="1230.28" data-end="1231.34">across various browsers.</span> <span data-start="1231.34" data-end="1233.805">You can also specify specific browser versions as well.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1238.31" data-end="1239.976"><span class="speaker">Tom Greenaway</span>: And also, the golden rule</span> <span data-start="1239.976" data-end="1243.326">of any indexability and building a website for search crawlers</span> <span data-start="1243.326" data-end="1244.7">and that kind of thing is to just</span> <span data-start="1244.7" data-end="1246.23">make sure you test really frequently as well.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1246.23" data-end="1246.92"><span class="speaker">Martin Splitt</span>: Yeah, fair enough.</span> <span data-start="1246.92" data-end="1247.42">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="1247.42" data-end="1248.45">Test, test, test.</span> <span data-start="1248.45" data-end="1249.28">Fair enough.</span> <span data-start="1249.28" data-end="1250.02">Cool.</span> <span data-start="1250.02" data-end="1254.88">So going back to dynamic rendering for just a second</span> <span data-start="1254.88" data-end="1258.83">and the tools discussion —  so if I test my stuff and I figure</span> <span data-start="1258.83" data-end="1261.77">out, oh no, this feature is really tricky to work around</span> <span data-start="1261.77" data-end="1263.676">and I want to not change my code — </span> <span data-start="1263.676" data-end="1265.55">I guess I can use dynamic rendering for that.</span> <span data-start="1265.55" data-end="1266.842">But I guess there's trade-offs.</span> <span data-start="1266.842" data-end="1269.133">And there's situations where I shouldn't be doing that.</span> <span data-start="1269.133" data-end="1271.58">So what are the sites that should, generally speaking,</span> <span data-start="1271.58" data-end="1272.777">look into dynamic rendering?</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1272.777" data-end="1275.36"><span class="speaker">Tom Greenaway</span>: Well, because the rendering queue can introduce</span> <span data-start="1275.36" data-end="1278.511">some delay, if your site has lots of frequently changing</span> <span data-start="1278.511" data-end="1280.76">content —  like a news publisher or something like that</span> <span data-start="1280.76" data-end="1283.176">and you've got, maybe, breaking news and articles that are</span> <span data-start="1283.176" data-end="1285.62">coming out and changing very frequently — </span> <span data-start="1285.62" data-end="1288.65">you probably might want to look into using dynamic rendering</span> <span data-start="1288.65" data-end="1290.87">to overcome those delays.</span> <span data-start="1290.87" data-end="1293.69">And if your pages use features that aren't available in Chrome</span> <span data-start="1293.69" data-end="1296.52">41 and it's not possible to work around those limitations,</span> <span data-start="1296.52" data-end="1299.06">maybe, in the short-term, then using dynamic rendering</span> <span data-start="1299.06" data-end="1303.26">is a useful workaround until either Googlebot catches up</span> <span data-start="1303.26" data-end="1305.57">or you have the time to adapt that</span> <span data-start="1305.57" data-end="1306.706">in your own implementation.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1306.706" data-end="1308.33"><span class="speaker">Martin Splitt</span>: Right, that makes sense.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1308.33" data-end="1309.996"><span class="speaker">Tom Greenaway</span>: And also, while Googlebot</span> <span data-start="1309.996" data-end="1312.18">is supporting JavaScript, other crawlers might not.</span> <span data-start="1312.18" data-end="1315.36">So for example, if your site is using social media interactions</span> <span data-start="1315.36" data-end="1317.63">a lot, those crawlers tend to not run JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="1317.63" data-end="1321.92">So if I share a link and I'm sharing it on social media</span> <span data-start="1321.92" data-end="1325.4">but I want a nice preview card to be created,</span> <span data-start="1325.4" data-end="1327.107">it probably wants to try and access</span> <span data-start="1327.107" data-end="1329.69">the image and the title and the meta-description, or something</span> <span data-start="1329.69" data-end="1331.009">like that.</span> <span data-start="1331.009" data-end="1333.05">So if you're actually using client-side rendering</span> <span data-start="1333.05" data-end="1335.075">for those things, then you might get,</span> <span data-start="1335.075" data-end="1337.81">just, the variable templates [INAUDIBLE] in the content.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1337.81" data-end="1338.86"><span class="speaker">Martin Splitt</span>: Ah, you use an image, and it doesn't — </span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1338.86" data-end="1340.55"><span class="speaker">Tom Greenaway</span>: Yeah —  in the preview, which would be bad.</span> <span data-start="1340.55" data-end="1341.31">[RASPBERRY SOUND]</span> <span data-start="1341.31" data-end="1343.31">So in order to get better representations there,</span> <span data-start="1343.31" data-end="1346.78">you can also serve a dynamically rendered version page.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1346.78" data-end="1347.809"><span class="speaker">Martin Splitt</span>: Cool.</span> <span data-start="1347.809" data-end="1348.6">Sounds pretty good.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1348.6" data-end="1350.39"><span class="speaker">Tom Greenaway</span>: But ultimately, dynamic</span> <span data-start="1350.39" data-end="1352.04">rendering —  it's a powerful technique.</span> <span data-start="1352.04" data-end="1352.87">But it's still a workaround.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1352.87" data-end="1353.116"><span class="speaker">Martin Splitt</span>: Yes!</span> <span data-start="1353.116" data-end="1353.49">It's a workaround.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="1353.49" data-end="1355.031"><span class="speaker">Tom Greenaway</span>: So Martin, do you have</span> <span data-start="1355.031" data-end="1358.61">any ideas on if we've got plans to improve this on the Google</span> <span data-start="1358.61" data-end="1359.497">side?</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1359.497" data-end="1360.33"><span class="speaker">Martin Splitt</span>: Yeah.</span> <span data-start="1360.33" data-end="1361.413">Way to put me on the spot.</span> <span data-start="1361.413" data-end="1363.95">So I don't like to make predictions</span> <span data-start="1363.95" data-end="1364.92">on that kind of stuff.</span> <span data-start="1364.92" data-end="1369.44">But definitely, the way that our infrastructure is set up,</span> <span data-start="1369.44" data-end="1372.11">there is a bit of a gap between when we actually</span> <span data-start="1372.11" data-end="1374.9">execute the JavaScript and do the rendering and then</span> <span data-start="1374.9" data-end="1377.09">the indexing bits and the crawling.</span> <span data-start="1377.09" data-end="1380.03">So we try to bring these closer together, which</span> <span data-start="1380.03" data-end="1381.71">is an interesting technical challenge.</span> <span data-start="1381.71" data-end="1383.6">And then, at the same time, we are</span> <span data-start="1383.6" data-end="1385.67">trying to catch up with Chrome.</span> <span data-start="1385.67" data-end="1387.607">But we don't want to just catch up,</span> <span data-start="1387.607" data-end="1389.69">because then we're going to have the same frickin'</span> <span data-start="1389.69" data-end="1390.856">conversation in a few years.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1390.856" data-end="1392.774">Like, oh yeah, Chrome's running version 70.</span> <span data-start="1392.774" data-end="1394.19">And everyone's like, oh, when does</span> <span data-start="1394.19" data-end="1396.71">it get into three-digits land?</span> <span data-start="1396.71" data-end="1399.98">So we basically work on a process</span> <span data-start="1399.98" data-end="1401.98">that we're, hopefully, going to start very soon.</span> <span data-start="1401.98" data-end="1403.58">So I make no promises on when.</span> <span data-start="1403.58" data-end="1407.24">But we are working on figuring out a process to stay</span> <span data-start="1407.24" data-end="1410.45">up-to-date with Chrome, so that Googlebot does run with</span> <span data-start="1410.45" data-end="1412.22">the Chrome release schedule — </span> <span data-start="1412.22" data-end="1412.73">so that we are basically — </span> </p>
