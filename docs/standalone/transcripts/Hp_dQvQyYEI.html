<p><span data-start="5.325" data-end="7.45"><span class="speaker">Pj Mclachlan</span>: Your users know that the word install</span> <span data-start="7.45" data-end="9.742">means that it's software that's meant for their device,</span> <span data-start="9.742" data-end="11.815">and you want to meet your users' expectations.</span> <span data-start="11.815" data-end="14.44">So that's what you see there on the right, an app that launches</span> <span data-start="14.44" data-end="17.5">from the home screen and is essentially indistinguishable</span> <span data-start="17.5" data-end="20.37">from a native experience.</span> <span data-start="20.37" data-end="22.43">Let's start at the beginning of the story though.</span> <span data-start="22.43" data-end="24.097">Bookmarks are the original way for users</span> <span data-start="24.097" data-end="27.34">to get back to anywhere on the web they wanted to get back to.</span> <span data-start="27.34" data-end="29.298">They're kind of a universal install button,</span> <span data-start="29.298" data-end="31.34">and they've been available on every major browser</span> <span data-start="31.34" data-end="32.49">since the dawn of the web.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="32.49" data-end="35.3">So a good question would be, why don't we just use that?</span> <span data-start="35.3" data-end="37.62">And in a word, the answer is mobile.</span> <span data-start="37.62" data-end="39.56">Of course, you can bookmark on mobile,</span> <span data-start="39.56" data-end="41.81">but it never really fully made the jump.</span> <span data-start="41.81" data-end="44.21">And we do see significantly less bookmark usage on mobile</span> <span data-start="44.21" data-end="45.555">than we see on desktop.</span> <span data-start="45.555" data-end="47.18">One reason for that is that the UI just</span> <span data-start="47.18" data-end="48.31">isn't quite as convenient.</span> <span data-start="48.31" data-end="50.018">And that's not just saving the bookmarks,</span> <span data-start="50.018" data-end="55.69">it's also organizing and finding them as well.</span> <span data-start="55.69" data-end="58.08">The second challenge that we see for bookmarks on mobile</span> <span data-start="58.08" data-end="60.375">is that apps, as we just saw right now,</span> <span data-start="60.375" data-end="62.25">integrate into the mobile OS in ways that are</span> <span data-start="62.25" data-end="63.73">important for functionality.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="63.73" data-end="66.277">So for example, a lot of apps do need</span> <span data-start="66.277" data-end="68.61">to tie in to, say, Android's native sharing sheet, which</span> <span data-start="68.61" data-end="70.568">is what you see on the right side of the slide,</span> <span data-start="70.568" data-end="73.2">where a URL is shared from the Myntra PWA to Twitter.</span> <span data-start="73.2" data-end="76.99">And to enable a share target, we needed OS level entity.</span> <span data-start="76.99" data-end="78.93">We need something like an APK on Android,</span> <span data-start="78.93" data-end="82">and not just a bookmark</span> <span data-start="82" data-end="84.07">A lot of you will be familiar with this term Add</span> <span data-start="84.07" data-end="84.695">to Home Screen.</span> <span data-start="84.695" data-end="86.903">And again, you see that on the right in the Starbucks</span> <span data-start="86.903" data-end="88.125">screenshot in this example.</span> <span data-start="88.125" data-end="89.5">Unfortunately, Add to Home Screen</span> <span data-start="89.5" data-end="91.602">can actually mean two different things.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="91.602" data-end="93.31">It could mean that it's a bookmark that's</span> <span data-start="93.31" data-end="95.8">being placed on the home screen, or it could also</span> <span data-start="95.8" data-end="97.48">mean that it's actually an integrated</span> <span data-start="97.48" data-end="99.19">experience on the device.</span> <span data-start="99.19" data-end="101.11">And that's why we'll be using the word install</span> <span data-start="101.11" data-end="103.36">for the rest of this talk to talk about the integrated</span> <span data-start="103.36" data-end="103.96">experience.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="103.96" data-end="106.99">And in the future, you're going to see this in the browser UI</span> <span data-start="106.99" data-end="108.67">on mobile and desktop.</span> <span data-start="108.67" data-end="111.28">The reason for that is install is a UX affordance</span> <span data-start="111.28" data-end="113.32">that's familiar to mobile users who</span> <span data-start="113.32" data-end="116.53">are used to adding content from their OS's stores,</span> <span data-start="116.53" data-end="119.53">such as Play, and then finding that content again</span> <span data-start="119.53" data-end="122.74">on the device through whatever the native launch surfaces are.</span> <span data-start="122.74" data-end="125.77">So on mobile, usually from the home screen.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="125.77" data-end="130.433">Install aligns to a user's mental model for how install — </span> <span data-start="130.433" data-end="132.85">basically, how experiences ought to operate on the device.</span> <span data-start="132.85" data-end="136.9">An installed web app looks and feels like every other app.</span> <span data-start="136.9" data-end="139.45">And the fact that your user discovered and installed</span> <span data-start="139.45" data-end="142.12">your app from the browser or from Play</span> <span data-start="142.12" data-end="144.07">shouldn't actually matter when they go back</span> <span data-start="144.07" data-end="146.09">to use your app again.</span> <span data-start="146.09" data-end="149.2">Most importantly, the word install signals to users</span> <span data-start="149.2" data-end="152.005">that the experience was meant to be great on their device.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="158.607" data-end="160.19">Here's a summary of how web install is</span> <span data-start="160.19" data-end="161.65">different from bookmarks.</span> <span data-start="161.65" data-end="164.41">Web install offers users access to web apps</span> <span data-start="164.41" data-end="165.88">from familiar discovery and launch</span> <span data-start="165.88" data-end="167.71">surfaces for their device.</span> <span data-start="167.71" data-end="169.448">So install web apps can be standalone.</span> <span data-start="169.448" data-end="171.49">That means they can be separate from the browser.</span> <span data-start="171.49" data-end="174.19">It also means that they can be integrated into the native task</span> <span data-start="174.19" data-end="175.06">switcher.</span> <span data-start="175.06" data-end="178.03">And they can —  this is gonna be a more familiar way for users</span> <span data-start="178.03" data-end="179.47">to interact with apps, or it might</span> <span data-start="179.47" data-end="183.18">be more suitable to certain types of tasks than tabs.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="183.18" data-end="185.14">Web install integrates the web apps</span> <span data-start="185.14" data-end="188.27">with the device services that expect an installed app.</span> <span data-start="188.27" data-end="191.14">The important thing to remember when you're asking a user</span> <span data-start="191.14" data-end="193.69">to install a PWA is that with an installed app,</span> <span data-start="193.69" data-end="196.03">you're telling the user that it is an experience that</span> <span data-start="196.03" data-end="198.19">is meant for the device that the user is using,</span> <span data-start="198.19" data-end="199.36">and that means that you need to live up</span> <span data-start="199.36" data-end="201.068">to those expectations of what you design,</span> <span data-start="201.068" data-end="202.85">or you're going to have unhappy users.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="202.85" data-end="205.183">There's a good thing that we have a pattern for building</span> <span data-start="205.183" data-end="207.54">experiences that do just that.</span> <span data-start="207.54" data-end="210.6">Progressive Web Apps are a pattern for great apps</span> <span data-start="210.6" data-end="211.86">that use web technology.</span> <span data-start="211.86" data-end="213.86">And they have all the features and functionality</span> <span data-start="213.86" data-end="216.24">users expect from a modern app on mobile or desktop.</span> <span data-start="216.24" data-end="217.74">I'm sure most of you in this room</span> <span data-start="217.74" data-end="219.55">are quite familiar with PWAs at this point,</span> <span data-start="219.55" data-end="222.27">so I'll just cover some of the very high level background</span> <span data-start="222.27" data-end="224.37">information about PWAs for those of you who</span> <span data-start="224.37" data-end="226.323">maybe are new to the concept.</span> <span data-start="226.323" data-end="228.24">PWAs include things like personalized content,</span> <span data-start="228.24" data-end="230.25">offline mode, push notifications,</span> <span data-start="230.25" data-end="231.51">and instant loading.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="231.51" data-end="234.46">And PWAs and installed web apps do go hand in hand.</span> <span data-start="234.46" data-end="237.91">You need to have a PWA in order to offer install.</span> <span data-start="237.91" data-end="239.487">There are, of course, other projects</span> <span data-start="239.487" data-end="241.07">that are trying to crack this problem,</span> <span data-start="241.07" data-end="244.513">and you can take a look at React Native, at Electron or Cordova.</span> <span data-start="244.513" data-end="246.305">And all of these are basically offering you</span> <span data-start="246.305" data-end="249.3">a way to build native apps using web technology,</span> <span data-start="249.3" data-end="252.06">but those experiences do depend on functionality that won't</span> <span data-start="252.06" data-end="253.85">also work in the web browser.</span> <span data-start="253.85" data-end="256.617">PWA's goal is to build directly on the web.</span> <span data-start="256.617" data-end="258.45">So that means you can maintain one code base</span> <span data-start="258.45" data-end="261.72">and that's going to work for visitors both in the browser</span> <span data-start="261.72" data-end="263.43">as well as for your installed users.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="266.7" data-end="267.857"><span class="speaker">Sam Thorogood</span>: So hi.</span> <span data-start="267.857" data-end="269.94">I'm lucky enough to get to work on "Santa Tracker"</span> <span data-start="269.94" data-end="272.22">every year, which is a fun holiday themed</span> <span data-start="272.22" data-end="273.81">experience for all ages.</span> <span data-start="273.81" data-end="277.343">And so we'll be using this as an example as we go along.</span> <span data-start="277.343" data-end="278.76">Santa runs on basically everything</span> <span data-start="278.76" data-end="282.163">with a browser, even this magical screen changing device.</span> <span data-start="282.163" data-end="283.83">And so we find that folks who install it</span> <span data-start="283.83" data-end="285.99">to their home screens on any one of these platforms</span> <span data-start="285.99" data-end="288.323">where it's supported are some of our most engaged users,</span> <span data-start="288.323" data-end="289.88">coming back the most often.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="289.88" data-end="291.57">And on Android alone, a few years ago,</span> <span data-start="291.57" data-end="293.25">we found that about 10% of all our loads</span> <span data-start="293.25" data-end="294.96">were coming from that installed icon.</span> <span data-start="294.96" data-end="298.02">So that's a quite nice number.</span> <span data-start="298.02" data-end="300.44">This is fundamentally because, when an app is installed,</span> <span data-start="300.44" data-end="302.76">your users will feel like it is designed for them.</span> <span data-start="302.76" data-end="305.01">Users will have better engagement, more loyalty,</span> <span data-start="305.01" data-end="306.635">and have a positive experience with you</span> <span data-start="306.635" data-end="309.64">with your installed application.</span> <span data-start="309.64" data-end="311.98">But of course, who are these users?</span> <span data-start="311.98" data-end="314.345">Who is going to benefit from this extra power?</span> <span data-start="314.345" data-end="316.72">We're the first ones to admit that it won't be everybody.</span> <span data-start="316.72" data-end="319.57">The power of the web has always been that it is ephemeral.</span> <span data-start="319.57" data-end="322.09">Users can move seamlessly between experiences,</span> <span data-start="322.09" data-end="325.08">and so you shouldn't expect all of your users to install.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="325.08" data-end="327.79">And to that end, there is a bit of an install funnel.</span> <span data-start="327.79" data-end="331.87">This is the same as native apps or e-commerce conversions.</span> <span data-start="331.87" data-end="334.245">Most strategies for optimization apply here as well.</span> <span data-start="334.245" data-end="336.37">You don't want to push the user to convert too soon</span> <span data-start="336.37" data-end="339.33">or they'll leave your site running.</span> <span data-start="339.33" data-end="342.13">You should only promote install to users who are frequent users</span> <span data-start="342.13" data-end="344.19">or who will actually benefit from your services.</span> <span data-start="344.19" data-end="346.27">You know, focus on features that users</span> <span data-start="346.27" data-end="350.758">might care about, like smaller download size or faster access.</span> <span data-start="350.758" data-end="353.05">You'll also want to track the right events in analytics</span> <span data-start="353.05" data-end="354.675">to make sure you know what to optimize.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="354.675" data-end="357.26">PJ will cover this a bit later on.</span> <span data-start="357.26" data-end="359.08">So promote web install on screens</span> <span data-start="359.08" data-end="361.64">where the use case makes sense, including desktop, tablet,</span> <span data-start="361.64" data-end="362.35">and mobile.</span> <span data-start="362.35" data-end="366.29">Take this example of Spotify's CTA from a landing page.</span> <span data-start="366.29" data-end="369.91">We'll also be covering more of these as we go along.</span> <span data-start="369.91" data-end="372.16">So we've covered some of the what and some of the why.</span> <span data-start="372.16" data-end="376.54">And I'll continue now by talking about the how of install.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="376.54" data-end="379.1">Your basic requirements for supporting the installable web</span> <span data-start="379.1" data-end="381.86">are to have both our Web App Manifest and a Service Worker.</span> <span data-start="381.86" data-end="384.917">These are actually, in 2019, pretty well documented.</span> <span data-start="384.917" data-end="386.5">These are the same requirements, as we</span> <span data-start="386.5" data-end="389.05">mentioned, to be called a PWA.</span> <span data-start="389.05" data-end="391.36">I'll mostly be covering the Manifest.</span> <span data-start="391.36" data-end="393.97">For the Service Worker, just briefly, the requirement</span> <span data-start="393.97" data-end="396.16">is that you do actually load offline.</span> <span data-start="396.16" data-end="398.63">If your user clicks on your app icon while they're offline,</span> <span data-start="398.63" data-end="400.99">and they see nothing or an offline dino,</span> <span data-start="400.99" data-end="402.96">users will have a bad time and so will not</span> <span data-start="402.96" data-end="404.963">allow it to be installed in this case.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="404.963" data-end="407.38">I think you'll find some great amazing content on Codelabs</span> <span data-start="407.38" data-end="408.963">for Google and Service Workers online.</span> <span data-start="414.29" data-end="415.93">The Manifest is a simple JSON file,</span> <span data-start="415.93" data-end="418.44">which basically informs your user how the site acts</span> <span data-start="418.44" data-end="419.323">when it's installed.</span> <span data-start="419.323" data-end="421.74">You need one per app, and you need to include a link to it</span> <span data-start="421.74" data-end="423.573">from every page of your site so the user can</span> <span data-start="423.573" data-end="425.05">tap install anywhere.</span> <span data-start="425.05" data-end="427.745">And I'm kind of trivializing it, but pretty</span> <span data-start="427.745" data-end="429.87">much all modern browsers have some level of support</span> <span data-start="429.87" data-end="434.047">for this file, and including it's quite simple.</span> <span data-start="434.047" data-end="435.88">You simply include a link in pretty much all</span> <span data-start="435.88" data-end="437.56">your pages, as I mentioned, because you</span> <span data-start="437.56" data-end="439.602">don't know where your user will hit install from.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="491.41" data-end="493.63">Like I said, there's actually tons of information</span> <span data-start="493.63" data-end="496.34">out there on the web.</span> <span data-start="496.34" data-end="498.323">But I want to cover some important patterns.</span> <span data-start="498.323" data-end="500.24">You need to include a few icons, including one</span> <span data-start="500.24" data-end="502.37">which is at least 512 by 512.</span> <span data-start="502.37" data-end="504.53">And remember that this isn't your site's fav icon,</span> <span data-start="504.53" data-end="506.872">so you still need to include one of those.</span> <span data-start="506.872" data-end="509.33">In building "Santa Tracker," one thing we really discovered</span> <span data-start="509.33" data-end="511.798">was that there's no implicit internationalization support.</span> <span data-start="511.798" data-end="514.215">You need to serve a different Manifest for every language.</span> <span data-start="516.85" data-end="520.48">And icons, the standard also now describes maskable icons.</span> <span data-start="520.48" data-end="522.799">The very short version is, if you provide an icon</span> <span data-start="522.799" data-end="524.897">and indicate that it's maskable, this is a signal</span> <span data-start="524.897" data-end="527.23">to the platform that it can cut your icon down to safely</span> <span data-start="527.23" data-end="529.89">display crazy icon types like circles,</span> <span data-start="529.89" data-end="531.94">[? square-circles, ?] or teardrops,</span> <span data-start="531.94" data-end="534.58">making your users feel like the app was really made for them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="534.58" data-end="536.08">And with this, we actually recommend</span> <span data-start="536.08" data-end="538.9">not using transparency in your PWA icons at all,</span> <span data-start="538.9" data-end="541.43">because the OS is handling this part for you.</span> <span data-start="541.43" data-end="543.17">Of course, this is still a bit brand new,</span> <span data-start="543.17" data-end="544.48">so we recommend also loading up your app</span> <span data-start="544.48" data-end="545.938">in some major environments to check</span> <span data-start="545.938" data-end="548.06">what the icon will look like.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="548.06" data-end="550.31">There's a few more things coming in the Manifest which</span> <span data-start="550.31" data-end="551.772">are also worth mentioning.</span> <span data-start="551.772" data-end="553.73">App shortcuts have just been added to the spec.</span> <span data-start="553.73" data-end="556.55">This lets an install icon provide secondary intents,</span> <span data-start="556.55" data-end="557.77">perhaps with one press.</span> <span data-start="557.77" data-end="560.145">I've kind of cheated here and show you an Android example</span> <span data-start="560.145" data-end="561.4">of this case.</span> <span data-start="561.4" data-end="563.51">And Web Share Target, which we'll cover more,</span> <span data-start="563.51" data-end="568.15">allows an installed web app to be a target for sharing.</span> <span data-start="568.15" data-end="570.638">We're also just seeing a bunch of tooling around manifests.</span> <span data-start="570.638" data-end="572.68">And we think that honestly, going forward, nearly</span> <span data-start="572.68" data-end="576.17">every tool chain will just provide you a web app manifest.</span> <span data-start="576.17" data-end="577.878">And so while we're glad you're listening,</span> <span data-start="577.878" data-end="579.795">this stuff is also becoming just boring enough</span> <span data-start="579.795" data-end="582.22">that it's likely handled for you, which is great for us</span> <span data-start="582.22" data-end="585.22">as web developers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="585.22" data-end="586.85">So as I mentioned earlier, Manifests</span> <span data-start="586.85" data-end="589.19">are supported by pretty much all modern browsers, which</span> <span data-start="589.19" data-end="591.95">leads me on to, well, the nuances,</span> <span data-start="591.95" data-end="595.18">a web developer's best friend.</span> <span data-start="595.18" data-end="596.29">Let's start with Android.</span> <span data-start="596.29" data-end="598.58">This was the first place that install was available,</span> <span data-start="598.58" data-end="601.27">and once installed, apps are first class citizens</span> <span data-start="601.27" data-end="605.29">provided by real native APKs.</span> <span data-start="605.29" data-end="607.12">Importantly, Chrome on Android is actually</span> <span data-start="607.12" data-end="608.98">able to prompt your users to install</span> <span data-start="608.98" data-end="611.5">if your site includes a Service Worker and a Manifest.</span> <span data-start="611.5" data-end="613.18">"Santa Tracker" here is actually pretty ambitious.</span> <span data-start="613.18" data-end="614.722">If you take a look at this animation,</span> <span data-start="614.722" data-end="616.24">even during the loading screen, it</span> <span data-start="616.24" data-end="618.13">pops up a little mini info bar.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="618.13" data-end="621.93">It's not ideal, but we'll revisit this in a bit.</span> <span data-start="621.93" data-end="624.03">Regardless, if you then tap that info bar,</span> <span data-start="624.03" data-end="626.35">you'll get a full screen prompt to install.</span> <span data-start="626.35" data-end="628.35">There's a few things to dissect here.</span> <span data-start="628.35" data-end="630.9">While this does say Add to Home Screen, as we mentioned,</span> <span data-start="630.9" data-end="632.52">we're moving away from that verbiage</span> <span data-start="632.52" data-end="635.4">as we support really so many platforms now.</span> <span data-start="635.4" data-end="637.468">And as I mentioned, this generates a real APK</span> <span data-start="637.468" data-end="639.26">that works with any launcher, and is really</span> <span data-start="639.26" data-end="642.05">a first class system for users like any other installed</span> <span data-start="642.05" data-end="644.368">application.</span> <span data-start="644.368" data-end="645.91">Another option for install on Android</span> <span data-start="645.91" data-end="648.847">is something called Trusted Web Activities or TWA.</span> <span data-start="648.847" data-end="650.93">While this has a few [? details ?] to get through,</span> <span data-start="650.93" data-end="652.76">fundamentally, you're writing an Android application which</span> <span data-start="652.76" data-end="654.98">features a core activity provided by Chrome,</span> <span data-start="654.98" data-end="657.58">or actually, fairly soon, Firefox as well.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="657.58" data-end="659.33">And you're uploading it to the Play Store,</span> <span data-start="659.33" data-end="660.83">so it's discoverable and promotable</span> <span data-start="660.83" data-end="662.84">like any other native app.</span> <span data-start="662.84" data-end="666.11">The best way to learn more here is to go and follow</span> <span data-start="666.11" data-end="667.94">Google's Codelabs on this.</span> <span data-start="667.94" data-end="671.49">Do a search for TWA Codelabs to find out more.</span> <span data-start="671.49" data-end="672.99">We've also got an interesting option</span> <span data-start="672.99" data-end="675.87">for folks who are using Managed Play with G Suite.</span> <span data-start="675.87" data-end="678.36">This means if your organization signs into corporate Gmail</span> <span data-start="678.36" data-end="679.98">on their devices, you can simply push</span> <span data-start="679.98" data-end="683.31">real APKs that load your website by Managed Play.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="683.31" data-end="684.99">There's quite a few steps.</span> <span data-start="684.99" data-end="686.29">This video is quite long.</span> <span data-start="686.29" data-end="687.87">But if you watch closely here, I've</span> <span data-start="687.87" data-end="690.57">built "Santa Tracker for Work," which pushes "Santa Tracker"</span> <span data-start="690.57" data-end="692.388">to all the elves and in Santa's org.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="692.388" data-end="694.18">So while we think this is real interesting,</span> <span data-start="694.18" data-end="696.763">it's also worth noting that your corporate users will actually</span> <span data-start="696.763" data-end="699.48">never see the URL that's being added to their device.</span> <span data-start="699.48" data-end="702.3">You're able to push any website as a real app, not just</span> <span data-start="702.3" data-end="704.94">your own.</span> <span data-start="704.94" data-end="707.4">Finally, and probably most interestingly,</span> <span data-start="707.4" data-end="709.12">let's talk about the how in iOS.</span> <span data-start="709.12" data-end="711.37">iOS has had install for web apps since the beginning,</span> <span data-start="711.37" data-end="712.912">but the last few releases have really</span> <span data-start="712.912" data-end="715.07">made install in iOS quite practical.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="715.07" data-end="717.68">Here's an example of loading "Santa Tracker" from the iPad.</span> <span data-start="717.68" data-end="719.13">We do have to have custom icons.</span> <span data-start="719.13" data-end="722.21">This is done by the iOS metadata icon tags, which I won't really</span> <span data-start="722.21" data-end="723.223">cover here.</span> <span data-start="723.223" data-end="724.64">And while they're a bit of a pain,</span> <span data-start="724.64" data-end="727.022">tooling can help you generate these.</span> <span data-start="727.022" data-end="728.48">Apple has also previously suggested</span> <span data-start="728.48" data-end="730.07">providing splash screens.</span> <span data-start="730.07" data-end="733.53">Honestly, we don't think this is that important anymore.</span> <span data-start="733.53" data-end="735.94">IOS 13 has brought you nice animations and fades</span> <span data-start="735.94" data-end="738.44">that make sure that your website isn't just jarringly dumped</span> <span data-start="738.44" data-end="739.55">on the screen.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="739.55" data-end="741.155">We didn't use one in this example.</span> <span data-start="743.81" data-end="746.74">And last but not least, I also want to talk about desktop.</span> <span data-start="746.74" data-end="748.96">Only Chrome provides install on desktop right now,</span> <span data-start="748.96" data-end="752.02">but it works well across all platforms, macOS, Linux,</span> <span data-start="752.02" data-end="753.858">Chrome OS, and Windows.</span> <span data-start="753.858" data-end="755.65">Your sites will get the little plus button,</span> <span data-start="755.65" data-end="758.07">and users will get a native app that lives in their launcher.</span> <span data-start="758.07" data-end="759.76">The plus button will even wiggle a little bit</span> <span data-start="759.76" data-end="762.093">if you do the right thing, calling attention to the fact</span> <span data-start="762.093" data-end="763.319">that install is available.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="787.07" data-end="789.77">Now, keep in mind that there's all kinds of reasons</span> <span data-start="789.77" data-end="792.43">that a user may not have or want your native app</span> <span data-start="792.43" data-end="794.18">but might still want the web app.</span> <span data-start="794.18" data-end="796.73">Storage, for example, is the number one reason</span> <span data-start="796.73" data-end="798.95">that users remove apps from their device.</span> <span data-start="798.95" data-end="801.23">But most web apps are tiny, and the stores</span> <span data-start="801.23" data-end="803.24">that most web apps use can be dynamically purged</span> <span data-start="803.24" data-end="805.91">from the browser through either a manual cache clear</span> <span data-start="805.91" data-end="807.607">or in response to storage pressure.</span> <span data-start="807.607" data-end="809.69">So you may want to let users know that the web app</span> <span data-start="809.69" data-end="812.24">option exists, but you don't want to create any channel</span> <span data-start="812.24" data-end="814.56">conflict with your native apps.</span> <span data-start="814.56" data-end="817.58">So to avoid promoting your PWA install feature to native app</span> <span data-start="817.58" data-end="820.46">users, you want to use the getInstalledRelatedApps,</span> <span data-start="820.46" data-end="821.9">just there to help.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="988.62" data-end="992.08">So the first is when that prompt is actually available,</span> <span data-start="992.08" data-end="995.72">when did the site fulfill the installability criteria?</span> <span data-start="995.72" data-end="997.93">And that happens with the beforeinstallprompt event.</span> <span data-start="997.93" data-end="1000.013">And that's what you listen for, and you can set up</span> <span data-start="1000.013" data-end="1001.72">an analytics event there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1001.72" data-end="1005.7">The second is the analytics for when the prompt is triggered.</span> <span data-start="1005.7" data-end="1007.89">If you're taking the recommended approach here</span> <span data-start="1007.89" data-end="1012.6">and you're tying that to a piece of UI inside of your web</span> <span data-start="1012.6" data-end="1015.12">content, then this is going to be probably a click</span> <span data-start="1015.12" data-end="1018.8">handler on some element inside of your page.</span> <span data-start="1018.8" data-end="1021.03">And finally, when the user has actually</span> <span data-start="1021.03" data-end="1022.8">completed the app install, you're</span> <span data-start="1022.8" data-end="1025.55">going to want to listen for the app installed event.</span> <span data-start="1025.55" data-end="1027.99">And this is what's going to tell you that the app install</span> <span data-start="1027.99" data-end="1029.97">was completed successfully and the user</span> <span data-start="1029.97" data-end="1032.43">hit OK from the browser UI.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1035.06" data-end="1037.609">So you may be asking yourself, what about iOS?</span> <span data-start="1037.609" data-end="1040.64">And the great news here is that iOS Safari has had support</span> <span data-start="1040.64" data-end="1043.31">for the essential PWA Ingredient Service Worker</span> <span data-start="1043.31" data-end="1045.089">for quite a while now.</span> <span data-start="1045.089" data-end="1047.51">And it's easier than ever to install PWAs</span> <span data-start="1047.51" data-end="1050.99">from iOS Safari with Add to Home Screen</span> <span data-start="1050.99" data-end="1053.18">like moving to an option on the first level menu.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1053.18" data-end="1056.207">So here's an install promotional pattern for iOS</span> <span data-start="1056.207" data-end="1058.04">that we're going to use for "Santa Tracker."</span> <span data-start="1058.04" data-end="1059.84">Notice how this —  we're basically</span> <span data-start="1059.84" data-end="1062.6">triggering a pop-up helper to help</span> <span data-start="1062.6" data-end="1065.27">the user through the install experience from the Install</span> <span data-start="1065.27" data-end="1065.98">button.</span> <span data-start="1065.98" data-end="1067.07">And this is the same Install button</span> <span data-start="1067.07" data-end="1068.91">that we're going to use on Android as well.</span> <span data-start="1068.91" data-end="1071.33">So the delta between the two experiences</span> <span data-start="1071.33" data-end="1072.77">is really quite small.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1103.06" data-end="1105.56">So we at Google love the web, and there's now an expectation</span> <span data-start="1105.56" data-end="1107.72">that perhaps an installed app acts and feels</span> <span data-start="1107.72" data-end="1109.38">like it's always been that way.</span> <span data-start="1109.38" data-end="1111.452">And this advice isn't really unique to PWAs.</span> <span data-start="1111.452" data-end="1112.91">I want to talk about the feeling we</span> <span data-start="1112.91" data-end="1116.36">get when we use web apps like Gmail, Spotify, or even</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1116.36" data-end="1117.38">Google Docs.</span> <span data-start="1117.38" data-end="1120.2">When I use these apps, I almost forget that I'm on the web.</span> <span data-start="1120.2" data-end="1123.468">How can you help your users have that same level of immersion?</span> <span data-start="1123.468" data-end="1125.26">There's a few tips I'd like to talk through</span> <span data-start="1125.26" data-end="1127">to make your site feel more native</span> <span data-start="1127" data-end="1129.26">and lose the uncanny feeling.</span> <span data-start="1129.26" data-end="1131.21">Focus rings are where I'm going to start.</span> <span data-start="1131.21" data-end="1133.22">These let the user know where the cursor is.</span> <span data-start="1133.22" data-end="1134.63">Pretty basic access accessibility</span> <span data-start="1134.63" data-end="1136.4">feature, which you should keep.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1136.4" data-end="1138.758">But the default ring is a definite tell of the web.</span> <span data-start="1138.758" data-end="1141.05">So mix it up, and this applies to form elements as well</span> <span data-start="1141.05" data-end="1143.302">as links.</span> <span data-start="1143.302" data-end="1145.01">Text selection is also probably something</span> <span data-start="1145.01" data-end="1147.218">you want to disable, especially on UI components,</span> <span data-start="1147.218" data-end="1148.76">because it's not an expected behavior</span> <span data-start="1148.76" data-end="1150.56">of installed applications.</span> <span data-start="1150.56" data-end="1152.57">Personally, I'm not ever a fan of making this UI</span> <span data-start="1152.57" data-end="1154.945">part of a page selectable, but it's especially pronounced</span> <span data-start="1154.945" data-end="1157.6">when installed.</span> <span data-start="1157.6" data-end="1158.8">And set a theme color.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1158.8" data-end="1160.72">This refers to the window color of your app,</span> <span data-start="1160.72" data-end="1162.97">as you see in this desktop version of "Santa Tracker,"</span> <span data-start="1162.97" data-end="1163.94">where it's a dark blue.</span> <span data-start="1163.94" data-end="1165.22">By the default, it's from the platform,</span> <span data-start="1165.22" data-end="1167.39">so you don't really know what you're going to get.</span> <span data-start="1167.39" data-end="1169.33">An over scroll, which you can see happening here,</span> <span data-start="1169.33" data-end="1170.997">is actually somewhat related, because it</span> <span data-start="1170.997" data-end="1173.71">can mean that three contrasting colors end up showing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1173.71" data-end="1176.35">And in most cases, you just want to disable over scroll</span> <span data-start="1176.35" data-end="1178.07">to prevent this from happening.</span> <span data-start="1178.07" data-end="1179.368">It's a very web pattern.</span> <span data-start="1179.368" data-end="1180.91">As an alternative, at least make sure</span> <span data-start="1180.91" data-end="1185.26">that your HTML tag is set to a reasonable background color</span> <span data-start="1185.26" data-end="1187.12">that's not the default white.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1187.12" data-end="1190.3">Also very briefly mention safe area inset,</span> <span data-start="1190.3" data-end="1192.19">which if you're a fan of notches on phones,</span> <span data-start="1192.19" data-end="1194.26">let you avoid that notch and put some color</span> <span data-start="1194.26" data-end="1197.94">or interesting content behind that area.</span> <span data-start="1197.94" data-end="1201.6">You'll also want to think about some UX changes.</span> <span data-start="1201.6" data-end="1203.52">I'm going to go through these fairly quickly.</span> <span data-start="1203.52" data-end="1206.19">First, don't allow navigation outside your own site.</span> <span data-start="1206.19" data-end="1209.24">If you do, users will get a really ugly URL bar.</span> <span data-start="1209.24" data-end="1210.99">Make sure you always open external content</span> <span data-start="1210.99" data-end="1212.7">in a new window.</span> <span data-start="1212.7" data-end="1215.58">Next, think about better behavior for extended actions</span> <span data-start="1215.58" data-end="1218.25">like select all, undo, and redo, especially</span> <span data-start="1218.25" data-end="1219.83">if your experience is app like.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1597.01" data-end="1599.92">With each of these key interventions</span> <span data-start="1599.92" data-end="1603.79">we were able to see good, sizable lift in conversion,</span> <span data-start="1603.79" data-end="1606.52">as well as key capability increase.</span> <span data-start="1606.52" data-end="1611.53">Also, our product was made more accessible to the end users.</span> <span data-start="1611.53" data-end="1614.89">Let me take you through each of these interventions one by one.</span> <span data-start="1618.72" data-end="1622.29">PWA was the first major intervention for us.</span> <span data-start="1622.29" data-end="1625.11">It provided users with key UX capabilities,</span> <span data-start="1625.11" data-end="1627">like offline support, reliability</span> <span data-start="1627" data-end="1631.15">on different networks, which was especially important for us,</span> <span data-start="1631.15" data-end="1636.21">given the markets we were present in, and also better</span> <span data-start="1636.21" data-end="1637.5">latency.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1637.5" data-end="1641.11">Overall, we saw a conversion lift of around 2.2X,</span> <span data-start="1641.11" data-end="1644.73">while our user base also rose by 4X.</span> <span data-start="1644.73" data-end="1647.17">We saw a latency rise of almost 75%.</span> <span data-start="1650.02" data-end="1653.71">Our product was optimized leaps and bounds.</span> <span data-start="1653.71" data-end="1656.16">And this was one of the first major breakthroughs</span> <span data-start="1656.16" data-end="1659.61">which really made us believe in OYO mobile web.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1659.61" data-end="1662.32">With an already optimized product in our hands,</span> <span data-start="1662.32" data-end="1664.92">we were looking to make it more and more accessible to the end</span> <span data-start="1664.92" data-end="1666.16">users.</span> <span data-start="1666.16" data-end="1670.283">This is where the capability of browser installs</span> <span data-start="1670.283" data-end="1671.2">came into the picture.</span> <span data-start="1673.78" data-end="1676.33">From browser installs, users were already</span> <span data-start="1676.33" data-end="1680.56">converting by around 2X as compared to PWA.</span> <span data-start="1680.56" data-end="1682.72">Having these metrics [? insight, ?] we</span> <span data-start="1682.72" data-end="1685.82">were actually looking to increase its adoption.</span> <span data-start="1685.82" data-end="1689.14">This is where we started doing a lot of A/B experiments</span> <span data-start="1689.14" data-end="1693.4">around how to have nudges across user journeys.</span> <span data-start="1693.4" data-end="1698.29">We started making nudges on home pages and [INAUDIBLE] pages</span> <span data-start="1698.29" data-end="1702.38">in which we saw adoption increase of around 1.5X,</span> <span data-start="1702.38" data-end="1706.52">whereas we did not see any drop in PWA conversion.</span> <span data-start="1709.16" data-end="1711.95">Finally, this May, we released OYO Lite,</span> <span data-start="1711.95" data-end="1714.74">which was built on Trusted Web Activity.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1714.74" data-end="1719.6">It was a major breakthrough in the world of OYO mobile web.</span> <span data-start="1719.6" data-end="1721.67">Users were starting to get access</span> <span data-start="1721.67" data-end="1726.42">to OYO PWA on Play Store, which was really cool.</span> <span data-start="1726.42" data-end="1729.39">The numbers since have been incredible.</span> <span data-start="1729.39" data-end="1733.61">We have a similar rating on OYO Lite as compared to native app.</span> <span data-start="1733.61" data-end="1737.24">This showcases the importance of core capabilities</span> <span data-start="1737.24" data-end="1740.66">like low size, easy over the air updates,</span> <span data-start="1740.66" data-end="1744.17">deep linking support, full screen, and a lot</span> <span data-start="1744.17" data-end="1747.18">of other capabilities.</span> <span data-start="1747.18" data-end="1751.35">Overall, we were seeing a conversion lift of 3X as</span> <span data-start="1751.35" data-end="1754.74">compared to PWA, and our conversion</span> <span data-start="1754.74" data-end="1758.27">was similar to the native app.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1758.27" data-end="1761.42">To summarize, each of these interventions</span> <span data-start="1761.42" data-end="1766.4">has brought about a good growth in our channel.</span> <span data-start="1766.4" data-end="1771.11">From [?
