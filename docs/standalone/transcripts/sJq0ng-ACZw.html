<p><span data-start="0.02" data-end="2.52"><span class="speaker">Sam Thorogood</span>: Hi, I'm Sam from the Developer Relations Team</span> <span data-start="2.52" data-end="3.7">here at Google.</span> <span data-start="3.7" data-end="6.6">And I'm here to tell you that it's OK to abandon all hope,</span> <span data-start="6.6" data-end="9.91">to give up, and to go back on your plans.</span> <span data-start="9.91" data-end="11.43">Let me set the scene for you.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="11.43" data-end="13.95">As you plan your next release and you look at your code,</span> <span data-start="13.95" data-end="15.45">it's very easy to fall into the trap</span> <span data-start="15.45" data-end="18.877">of improving your code base rather than moving forward.</span> <span data-start="18.877" data-end="20.46">You might consider having faster build</span> <span data-start="20.46" data-end="23.52">times, more readable code, or to upgrade to the latest web</span> <span data-start="23.52" data-end="26.22">framework that everyone's talking about.</span> <span data-start="26.22" data-end="29.023">This happened to me back in November, 2018 in the lead</span> <span data-start="29.023" data-end="31.44">up to releasing "Santa Tracker," which is a holiday themed</span> <span data-start="31.44" data-end="33.06">experience for all ages.</span> <span data-start="33.06" data-end="34.98">We were in the middle of a rewrite,</span> <span data-start="34.98" data-end="37.09">mainly because our build times were enormous,</span> <span data-start="37.09" data-end="39.09">and we wanted to use Google's new web components</span> <span data-start="39.09" data-end="41.01">library, LitElement.</span> <span data-start="41.01" data-end="43.53">But we made a hard decision to give up on our tech debt</span> <span data-start="43.53" data-end="46.11">and to ship our old code base because Santa only</span> <span data-start="46.11" data-end="47.34">comes once a year.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="47.34" data-end="49.63">And by being busy refactoring a code base,</span> <span data-start="49.63" data-end="53.41">we just weren't checking off our task list fast enough.</span> <span data-start="53.41" data-end="55.68">So let's talk a bit about what we were dealing with.</span> <span data-start="55.68" data-end="58.3">"Santa Tracker," at its core, is a shell,</span> <span data-start="58.3" data-end="60.39">which hosts lots of small games or scenes,</span> <span data-start="60.39" data-end="63.66">like this are fun snowball throwing game here.</span> <span data-start="63.66" data-end="66.815">And on December 24, we unlock the tracker itself,</span> <span data-start="66.815" data-end="68.19">where you can see Santa traveling</span> <span data-start="68.19" data-end="70.77">around the world on his journey delivering presents</span> <span data-start="70.77" data-end="73.59">and finding out when he'll arrive in your town.</span> <span data-start="73.59" data-end="75.94">Some of these games have code that is years old.</span> <span data-start="75.94" data-end="77.58">And, as much as possible, we want</span> <span data-start="77.58" data-end="80.55">to avoid throwing these games out in a rewrite.</span> <span data-start="80.55" data-end="82.56">So, in 2018, we decide to migrate</span> <span data-start="82.56" data-end="85.77">about 50 different games to work on this new platform.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="85.77" data-end="87.33">And, fundamentally, the rate we were</span> <span data-start="87.33" data-end="88.89">getting through our migration tasks</span> <span data-start="88.89" data-end="91.375">just didn't equal our December 1 release date.</span> <span data-start="91.375" data-end="92.5">And this is why we gave up.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="95.08" data-end="98.27">So we've now successfully migrated for 2019 and beyond.</span> <span data-start="98.27" data-end="101.74">But what did we learn in the process?</span> <span data-start="101.74" data-end="103.83">The first learning is the old idiom of,</span> <span data-start="103.83" data-end="105.96">don't let perfect be the enemy of good</span> <span data-start="105.96" data-end="107.76">as it applies to developer experience</span> <span data-start="107.76" data-end="109.245">versus user experience.</span> <span data-start="109.245" data-end="111.12">I imagined that "Santa Tracker" would somehow</span> <span data-start="111.12" data-end="113.1">be infinitely better for our users</span> <span data-start="113.1" data-end="116.16">if we had a faster build time and a more modern stack.</span> <span data-start="116.16" data-end="118.5">But the reality is that an upgrade would mostly</span> <span data-start="118.5" data-end="121.11">help my team and have very little benefit to our end</span> <span data-start="121.11" data-end="122.695">users.</span> <span data-start="122.695" data-end="124.32">Keep in mind, of course, that sometimes</span> <span data-start="124.32" data-end="126.9">your technical choices are changed from underneath you.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="126.9" data-end="129.479">And, in our case, we were using Hastymail inports,</span> <span data-start="129.479" data-end="131.37">which shipped in Chrome but never really got</span> <span data-start="131.37" data-end="132.84">wider adoption.</span> <span data-start="132.84" data-end="135.15">The truth is though there's often really fewer reasons</span> <span data-start="135.15" data-end="139.41">than we think as developers to change the stack.</span> <span data-start="139.41" data-end="141.81">Secondly, we learned the value of allocating time</span> <span data-start="141.81" data-end="143.58">to prototyping before you decided</span> <span data-start="143.58" data-end="145.23">on a new technical stack.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="145.23" data-end="147.66">This can save you a lot of grief and technical debt.</span> <span data-start="147.66" data-end="149.91">Technical debt is when you're on a tight deadline</span> <span data-start="149.91" data-end="151.92">and, instead of properly solving some problem,</span> <span data-start="151.92" data-end="154.378">you're patching over it and leaving it for your future self</span> <span data-start="154.378" data-end="155.1">to solve.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="155.1" data-end="157.397">And, of course, all software has technical debt.</span> <span data-start="157.397" data-end="159.48">But it's even worse when you're blazing new paths,</span> <span data-start="159.48" data-end="161.61">like we were, into a totally unknown framework</span> <span data-start="161.61" data-end="163.33">for a library.</span> <span data-start="163.33" data-end="165.99">And, for us, we didn't really allocate time for prototyping.</span> <span data-start="165.99" data-end="167.72">We were on a tight schedule.</span> <span data-start="167.72" data-end="169.303">You know, we'd bought into this vision</span> <span data-start="169.303" data-end="171.04">of a new, amazing developer experience.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="171.04" data-end="173.34">But, in practice, "Santa Tracker," like every site,</span> <span data-start="173.34" data-end="175.74">has edge cases that we didn't really plan for</span> <span data-start="175.74" data-end="178.17">and didn't fit into the mold of this new stack which</span> <span data-start="178.17" data-end="182.71">we'd chosen, which caused us to incur this technical debt.</span> <span data-start="182.71" data-end="184.62">Software always has innate knowledge.</span> <span data-start="184.62" data-end="186">Our old "Santa Tracker" code base</span> <span data-start="186" data-end="188.39">had years upon years of hacks and work arounds.</span> <span data-start="188.39" data-end="189.84">And, in any rewrite, it's enticing</span> <span data-start="189.84" data-end="191.85">to skip these weird code paths.</span> <span data-start="191.85" data-end="194.25">But, in the end, they were there for a reason.</span> <span data-start="194.25" data-end="196.59">By building a working prototype in a new stack,</span> <span data-start="196.59" data-end="198.45">you can test these edge cases to see</span> <span data-start="198.45" data-end="200.13">if they still matter to you.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="200.13" data-end="202.83">Because we skipped this step, we hit all sorts of challenges</span> <span data-start="202.83" data-end="204.84">way late into our development cycle</span> <span data-start="204.84" data-end="206.1">when it was just too late.</span> <span data-start="206.1" data-end="208.878">We had to give up on the refactor.</span> <span data-start="208.878" data-end="210.42">In hindsight, we should have built up</span> <span data-start="210.42" data-end="213.06">all these tricky nuances of our site in a full prototype</span> <span data-start="213.06" data-end="215.67">before attempting to replace the entire tech stack.</span> <span data-start="215.67" data-end="217.77">What we ended up doing with what we're using what</span> <span data-start="217.77" data-end="220.41">we built in 2018 as the prototype for what you now</span> <span data-start="220.41" data-end="222.72">seen in 2019 and beyond.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="222.72" data-end="223.8">Don't get me wrong.</span> <span data-start="223.8" data-end="226.02">In 2019, we still shipped some of the best</span> <span data-start="226.02" data-end="227.19">parts of the product type.</span> <span data-start="227.19" data-end="230.67">And that leads me to the final learning.</span> <span data-start="230.67" data-end="232.337">Ship early and ship often.</span> <span data-start="232.337" data-end="234.42">You always want to validate your technical choices</span> <span data-start="234.42" data-end="236.04">with real users.</span> <span data-start="236.04" data-end="238.89">So we'd written a whole new game, "Elf Maker," entirely</span> <span data-start="238.89" data-end="240">on the new stack.</span> <span data-start="240" data-end="242.59">It wasn't part of the old codebase whatsoever.</span> <span data-start="242.59" data-end="245.2">So we felt comfortable testing it with real users.</span> <span data-start="245.2" data-end="248.557">And, in fact, if you closely at how that scene loaded in 2018,</span> <span data-start="248.557" data-end="250.89">you could see how we introduced a bit of magic deferring</span> <span data-start="250.89" data-end="254.43">to an iframe, with a small shim between the codebases.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="254.43" data-end="257.191">We had to come talk to Frank in build system to make this work.</span> <span data-start="257.191" data-end="258.899">But, as part of that, we forced ourselves</span> <span data-start="258.899" data-end="261.69">to have an end-to-end build process of the new prototype,</span> <span data-start="261.69" data-end="263.95">even though we weren't shipping it wholesale.</span> <span data-start="263.95" data-end="266.325">And this meant that our rewrite wasn't just wholly turned</span> <span data-start="266.325" data-end="267.285">into just a prototype.</span> <span data-start="267.285" data-end="269.91">And we got a small slice of the new code in front of real users</span> <span data-start="269.91" data-end="271.956">to show that it could work.</span> <span data-start="271.956" data-end="272.862">[BELLS JINGLING]</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="272.862" data-end="275.07">We're hoping to open source the new version of "Santa</span> <span data-start="275.07" data-end="276.72">Tracker" in early 2020.</span> <span data-start="276.72" data-end="277.758">It's not perfect.</span> <span data-start="277.758" data-end="279.3">But it is a real website with a bunch</span> <span data-start="279.3" data-end="282.15">of build tooling, legacy card, and necessary technology</span> <span data-start="282.15" data-end="283.23">choices.</span> <span data-start="283.23" data-end="284.82">I hope you'll check it out and get</span> <span data-start="284.82" data-end="288.16">some insights into how to best structure your next project.</span> <span data-start="288.16" data-end="290.7">Remember, don't let perfect be the enemy of good.</span> <span data-start="290.7" data-end="292.962">Your users don't care how the sausage is made.</span> <span data-start="292.962" data-end="294.42">Ruminate on your technology choices</span> <span data-start="294.42" data-end="296.04">by building a prototype.</span> <span data-start="296.04" data-end="298.65">And, if possible, try to get the safest parts of your code</span> <span data-start="298.65" data-end="300.93">in front of real users, even if your whole refactor</span> <span data-start="300.93" data-end="302.37">isn't done yet.</span> <span data-start="302.37" data-end="304.65">Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.</span> <span data-start="304.65" data-end="308">[MUSIC PLAYING]</span> </p>
