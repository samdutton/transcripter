<p><span data-start="26.97" data-end="29.61">The tool uses SAS variables to show users</span> <span data-start="29.61" data-end="31.5">how to adjust an interface style,</span> <span data-start="31.5" data-end="34.41">and make their own brands shine by changing just a few lines</span> <span data-start="34.41" data-end="37.14">of code within a theme file.</span> <span data-start="37.14" data-end="39.27">For example, color can be adjusted</span> <span data-start="39.27" data-end="42.87">via a series of variables, such as primary, secondary,</span> <span data-start="42.87" data-end="45.27">background, and surface colors.</span> <span data-start="45.27" data-end="47.22">These come paired with on colors,</span> <span data-start="47.22" data-end="49.35">which represent the text color on top</span> <span data-start="49.35" data-end="52.04">of a variable background.</span> <span data-start="52.04" data-end="55.05">Shape customization can be made for three component size</span> <span data-start="55.05" data-end="56.34">classes — </span> <span data-start="56.34" data-end="58.89">small, medium, and large components.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="58.89" data-end="61.77">Small components include buttons and input,</span> <span data-start="61.77" data-end="65.19">medium components include modals and dialogues,</span> <span data-start="65.19" data-end="68.79">and large components include menus and drawers.</span> <span data-start="68.79" data-end="70.99">There's a great shape tool on material.io</span> <span data-start="70.99" data-end="74.1">to help you visualize these changes on our components</span> <span data-start="74.1" data-end="77.59">before applying them to your code base.</span> <span data-start="77.59" data-end="79.68">And finally, we can adjust typography</span> <span data-start="79.68" data-end="82.44">through the generalized MDC typography variable,</span> <span data-start="82.44" data-end="84.81">or through SAS maps that allow you to customize</span> <span data-start="84.81" data-end="87.69">individual typographic levels, such as having</span> <span data-start="87.69" data-end="91.11">a separate weight and font family for primary headlines</span> <span data-start="91.11" data-end="93.3">rather than the body copy.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="93.3" data-end="96.1">In the end, your theme could look something like this.</span> <span data-start="96.1" data-end="98.55">This is just one example that comes from Google Developer</span> <span data-start="98.55" data-end="99.742">Days in China.</span> <span data-start="99.742" data-end="101.7">We've made thousands of themes around the world</span> <span data-start="101.7" data-end="104.52">so far, so head over to Glitch to add your own.</span> <span data-start="104.52" data-end="106.44">We're also working on a set of guidelines</span> <span data-start="106.44" data-end="110.37">for adapting dark themes using Material components.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="110.37" data-end="113.91">For example, in a dark theme, Google Materials color palette</span> <span data-start="113.91" data-end="117.3">reduces intensity to mitigate visual vibration</span> <span data-start="117.3" data-end="121.05">or strong color contrast against a darker background.</span> <span data-start="121.05" data-end="124.02">Instead of solely adding drop shadows to illustrate elevation</span> <span data-start="124.02" data-end="128.13">and depth, in a dark theme, a lighter overlay is applied.</span> <span data-start="128.13" data-end="130.11">Check out the material.io guidelines</span> <span data-start="130.11" data-end="133.17">for more design guidance on how to transition your designs</span> <span data-start="133.17" data-end="137.79">into a dark theme, considering contrast, depth, desaturation,</span> <span data-start="137.79" data-end="140.76">and limiting colors for accessibility.</span> <span data-start="140.76" data-end="143.1">To help with this transition, MDC Web</span> <span data-start="143.1" data-end="145.92">has released a set of typography-themed variables</span> <span data-start="145.92" data-end="149.79">that respond to background shades for text styles.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="149.79" data-end="151.89">You can now also use the theme variables</span> <span data-start="151.89" data-end="153.94">in three different ways.</span> <span data-start="153.94" data-end="155.76">The most supportive and robust technique</span> <span data-start="155.76" data-end="159.57">is with our SAS styling API, using variables and mix-ins</span> <span data-start="159.57" data-end="161.61">to override styles.</span> <span data-start="161.61" data-end="164.46">You can also create CSS classes with the variable names</span> <span data-start="164.46" data-end="166.12">to style them by.</span> <span data-start="166.12" data-end="167.95">And finally, for modern browsers,</span> <span data-start="167.95" data-end="171.865">CSS custom properties can be used for the theme styling.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="171.865" data-end="174.24">We're still working on full support for custom properties</span> <span data-start="174.24" data-end="176.52">at this time.</span> <span data-start="176.52" data-end="179.22">We provide so many options because theming should not</span> <span data-start="179.22" data-end="180.39">be limiting.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="180.39" data-end="183">You can extend the theme builder to make your own theme</span> <span data-start="183" data-end="184.95">as unique as your product.</span> <span data-start="184.95" data-end="188.13">Leverage our code and build on top of our Material components</span> <span data-start="188.13" data-end="190.35">to quickly and easily get started building product</span> <span data-start="190.35" data-end="193.15">on the web.</span> <span data-start="193.15" data-end="195.97">The next new feature in Material is data tables.</span> <span data-start="195.97" data-end="197.95">You asked, we listened.</span> <span data-start="197.95" data-end="200.17">Our designers consider these three principles</span> <span data-start="200.17" data-end="202.43">when it comes to data tables.</span> <span data-start="202.43" data-end="206.74">The first is that data must be organized in a meaningful way.</span> <span data-start="206.74" data-end="210.64">Data tables should also be allowed for user interaction.</span> <span data-start="210.64" data-end="213.28">And finally, those interactions should be as logical</span> <span data-start="213.28" data-end="217.36">as the structure of the data table itself.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="217.36" data-end="219.97">Data tables come with some basic default functionality,</span> <span data-start="219.97" data-end="221.77">such as row selection.</span> <span data-start="221.77" data-end="224.39">But you can also hook them up to other components,</span> <span data-start="224.39" data-end="226.407">such as these filter chips.</span> <span data-start="226.407" data-end="228.49">Check out the links provided below for a deep dive</span> <span data-start="228.49" data-end="229.948">into how you can actually implement</span> <span data-start="229.948" data-end="233.65">data tables in your web projects and combine Material components</span> <span data-start="233.65" data-end="235.93">for orchestrated actions.</span> <span data-start="235.93" data-end="239.71">We also have a new density subsystem option in Material.</span> <span data-start="239.71" data-end="243.07">Material design uses low-density space by default,</span> <span data-start="243.07" data-end="245.56">with large tap targets and margins,</span> <span data-start="245.56" data-end="248.14">but offers high-density space when it improves the user</span> <span data-start="248.14" data-end="250.15">experience.</span> <span data-start="250.15" data-end="251.62">We brought density into our system</span> <span data-start="251.62" data-end="253.43">for the following reasons.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="253.43" data-end="255.43">The first is for scanability.</span> <span data-start="255.43" data-end="258.519">Scanability is improved for data-heavy applications</span> <span data-start="258.519" data-end="261.079">with a higher density interface.</span> <span data-start="261.079" data-end="262.99">The second is that dense UIs may actually</span> <span data-start="262.99" data-end="267.23">help users focus by reducing space between actions.</span> <span data-start="267.23" data-end="269.65">And finally, more content is available to the user</span> <span data-start="269.65" data-end="274.07">on a single screen in more high-density applications.</span> <span data-start="274.07" data-end="276.07">Whether or not to increase your UI's density</span> <span data-start="276.07" data-end="279.324">can be determined by how users interact with the component.</span> <span data-start="279.324" data-end="281.23">Components with high density enable</span> <span data-start="281.23" data-end="284.26">users to process and take action against large amounts</span> <span data-start="284.26" data-end="287.23">of information in a more manageable way.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="287.23" data-end="290.08">Lists, tables, and long forums are components that</span> <span data-start="290.08" data-end="292.52">benefit from increased density.</span> <span data-start="292.52" data-end="295.33">But density shouldn't be used for every component.</span> <span data-start="295.33" data-end="297.61">For example, don't apply density to components</span> <span data-start="297.61" data-end="300.93">that involve focused tasks or alert the user of changes,</span> <span data-start="300.93" data-end="303.49">such as snack bars or dialogues.</span> <span data-start="303.49" data-end="306.25">Applying high density to alerts reduces their ability</span> <span data-start="306.25" data-end="307.9">to command attention.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="307.9" data-end="309.91">A series of new styling classes on the web</span> <span data-start="309.91" data-end="312.86">allows for us to access density in three ways — </span> <span data-start="312.86" data-end="315.76">the default component size, a comfortable size,</span> <span data-start="315.76" data-end="318.64">which provides a higher density display while respecting</span> <span data-start="318.64" data-end="321.85">minimum touch target size, and compact,</span> <span data-start="321.85" data-end="324.82">which may be used for pages with a lot of information</span> <span data-start="324.82" data-end="328.16">but may be inappropriate for user actions.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="328.16" data-end="330.91">Materials.io got an update as well.</span> <span data-start="330.91" data-end="332.86">We now provide a cross platform view</span> <span data-start="332.86" data-end="334.45">of all of our component offerings</span> <span data-start="334.45" data-end="337.49">on a dedicated components page.</span> <span data-start="337.49" data-end="339.01">This page allows for quick access</span> <span data-start="339.01" data-end="342.385">to components and overview of cross-platform availability.</span> <span data-start="342.385" data-end="344.59">It should make it easier to navigate our product</span> <span data-start="344.59" data-end="346.78">and implement it for your needs.</span> <span data-start="346.78" data-end="352.45">Check out material.io/components to browse them all yourself.</span> <span data-start="352.45" data-end="355.12">And finally, we're kicking off a new initiative this year</span> <span data-start="355.12" data-end="358.48">to focus on supporting Material across web frameworks.</span> <span data-start="358.48" data-end="359">Why?</span> <span data-start="359" data-end="361">We know that most of you are developing web apps</span> <span data-start="361" data-end="362.26">using a framework.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="362.26" data-end="364.95">And the open source community has stepped up immensely,</span> <span data-start="364.95" data-end="367.72">building components for some of the most adopted web frameworks</span> <span data-start="367.72" data-end="368.893">out there.</span> <span data-start="368.893" data-end="371.31">We want to celebrate this work and help bring the Material</span> <span data-start="371.31" data-end="374.937">design vision to life, along with our open source community.</span> <span data-start="374.937" data-end="377.02">So many of you have already built your own wrapper</span> <span data-start="377.02" data-end="380.83">libraries using MDC Web's components, foundations,</span> <span data-start="380.83" data-end="382.327">and adapters.</span> <span data-start="382.327" data-end="384.16">And we're working more closely with the rest</span> <span data-start="384.16" data-end="386.03">of the open source community as well.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="386.03" data-end="388.15">We've updated material.io to link</span> <span data-start="388.15" data-end="390.88">to three of the most popular open source component</span> <span data-start="390.88" data-end="392.362">libraries.</span> <span data-start="392.362" data-end="394.57">They've already uncovered bugs in the Material design</span> <span data-start="394.57" data-end="396.59">guidelines, and asked great questions,</span> <span data-start="396.59" data-end="398.753">helping us to make Material even better.</span> <span data-start="398.753" data-end="401.17">And we're helping them to follow the spec and the Material</span> <span data-start="401.17" data-end="403.42">guidelines more closely as well.</span> <span data-start="403.42" data-end="405.623">We look forward to continuing the conversation</span> <span data-start="405.623" data-end="407.29">and working to bring the Material design</span> <span data-start="407.29" data-end="410.14">vision to every platform and framework, making it easier</span> <span data-start="410.14" data-end="414.07">for everyone to use Material design on the web.</span> <span data-start="414.07" data-end="415.81">There's so much to explore and play with,</span> <span data-start="415.81" data-end="418.66">from theming to density to data tables</span> <span data-start="418.66" data-end="421.81">to new website features, and our open source community.</span> </p>
