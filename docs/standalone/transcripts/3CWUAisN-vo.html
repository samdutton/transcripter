<p><span data-start="5.61" data-end="8.46">Today, I'm going to talk about web development on Chromebooks.</span> <span data-start="8.46" data-end="12.57">Here is a quote from you, a skilled web developer.</span> <span data-start="12.57" data-end="15.58">"Chromebooks are awesome."</span> <span data-start="15.58" data-end="17.85">And if you don't remember saying this recently,</span> <span data-start="17.85" data-end="19.78">I hope that after watching this video,</span> <span data-start="19.78" data-end="21.81">it will become a daily thing.</span> <span data-start="21.81" data-end="25.41">Chromebooks are known for being lightweight, fast, secure web</span> <span data-start="25.41" data-end="26.7">browsing machines.</span> <span data-start="26.7" data-end="28.5">They are so much more.</span> <span data-start="28.5" data-end="31.23">The device portfolio has grown to include tablets,</span> <span data-start="31.23" data-end="34.11">detachables, all-in-one, mini desktops,</span> <span data-start="34.11" data-end="36.63">and of course, laptops and convertibles.</span> <span data-start="36.63" data-end="40.59">Many of these are capable development devices.</span> <span data-start="40.59" data-end="42.62">So what can you run on them?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="42.62" data-end="47.87">Well, IDEs like Visual Studio Code, Atom, WebStorm,</span> <span data-start="47.87" data-end="51.29">tools like Node, React, Docker, and Git,</span> <span data-start="51.29" data-end="54.32">and you can test your web apps with multiple browsers,</span> <span data-start="54.32" data-end="56.57">including real mobile browsers.</span> <span data-start="56.57" data-end="59.36">As well, you can check how your mobile app interacts</span> <span data-start="59.36" data-end="63.03">with your web server, all right on the same device.</span> <span data-start="63.03" data-end="63.53">OK.</span> <span data-start="63.53" data-end="65.39">Let's get started and get your Chrome OS</span> <span data-start="65.39" data-end="67.82">device ready for development.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="67.82" data-end="70.07">We are going to set up a Linux environment</span> <span data-start="70.07" data-end="71.78">and then install the tools you need.</span> <span data-start="71.78" data-end="75.37">To start, open Chrome settings and search</span> <span data-start="75.37" data-end="77.36">or scroll down to Linux.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="77.36" data-end="79.64">Click Turn on.</span> <span data-start="79.64" data-end="82.37">This will download and setup a Linux environment.</span> <span data-start="82.37" data-end="85.03">When it's complete, you'll see a terminal prompt.</span> <span data-start="85.03" data-end="88.55">Pro tip —  if you will be doing a lot of development,</span> <span data-start="88.55" data-end="91.25">pin the Terminal by right-clicking and choosing</span> <span data-start="91.25" data-end="93.35">Pin.</span> <span data-start="93.35" data-end="95.24">Now we have a Linux environment.</span> <span data-start="95.24" data-end="97.55">Let's install some tools.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="97.55" data-end="100.34">Head over to the Visual Studio Code website</span> <span data-start="100.34" data-end="104.27">and download the Linux.deb package.</span> <span data-start="104.27" data-end="106.7">Double-click and choose Install.</span> <span data-start="106.7" data-end="108.35">Once it's installed, you can find</span> <span data-start="108.35" data-end="110.42">VS Code in your App Launcher.</span> <span data-start="110.42" data-end="112.565">If you're going to be using this IDE a lot,</span> <span data-start="112.565" data-end="114.44">you can pin it like we did with the Terminal.</span> <span data-start="120.53" data-end="124.58">Any application with a .deb package can be installed</span> <span data-start="124.58" data-end="125.96">in a similar way.</span> <span data-start="125.96" data-end="127.91">Let's install Atom.</span> <span data-start="127.91" data-end="130.58">The process is exactly the same — </span> <span data-start="130.58" data-end="137.66">download, install, and launch.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="137.66" data-end="140.692">Not every app has a .deb package,</span> <span data-start="140.692" data-end="143.15">but you can install any of your favorite tools that support</span> <span data-start="143.15" data-end="144.38">Debian Linux.</span> <span data-start="144.38" data-end="147.35">For example, to install Sublime Text,</span> <span data-start="147.35" data-end="149.57">follow the Linux instructions on the website</span> <span data-start="149.57" data-end="152.81">to set up the APT repo and install the editor using</span> <span data-start="152.81" data-end="155.69">the command line.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="155.69" data-end="157.95">When we install Node in a few seconds,</span> <span data-start="157.95" data-end="161.04">we'll take a closer look at command line installation.</span> <span data-start="161.04" data-end="164">And the same thing goes for apps like WebStorm.</span> <span data-start="164" data-end="166.61">Just go to the website, follow the Linux download</span> <span data-start="166.61" data-end="168.35">and install instructions.</span> <span data-start="168.35" data-end="170.15">I won't do WebStorm right now.</span> <span data-start="170.15" data-end="173.09">Let's get right on to the server side of things.</span> <span data-start="173.09" data-end="175.86">Oh, and by the way, at the end of this video,</span> <span data-start="175.86" data-end="178.1">I will direct you to a page by the Chrome OS DevRel</span> <span data-start="178.1" data-end="181.25">team with installation instructions for all the apps</span> <span data-start="181.25" data-end="184.36">and more discussed in this video.</span> <span data-start="184.36" data-end="186.49">Now, beyond what I mention today in this video,</span> <span data-start="186.49" data-end="188.67">if your favorite tool is supported in Linux,</span> <span data-start="188.67" data-end="190.17">it should run on Chromebooks.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="190.17" data-end="193.37">For example, I like gedit for text editing,</span> <span data-start="193.37" data-end="197.76">FileZilla as an FTP client, and Inkscape for vector graphics</span> <span data-start="197.76" data-end="199.21">editing.</span> <span data-start="199.21" data-end="201.55">Today, web development usually takes more</span> <span data-start="201.55" data-end="205.15">than a text editor, an IDE, or an FTP client.</span> <span data-start="205.15" data-end="207.25">Let's get to some other tools so we can</span> <span data-start="207.25" data-end="209.97">make some really nice web apps.</span> <span data-start="209.97" data-end="213.39">Node.js requires gnupg2.</span> <span data-start="213.39" data-end="217.38">Open up your Terminal and install it with apt.</span> <span data-start="217.38" data-end="223.56">That command is sudo apt install gnupg2.</span> <span data-start="223.56" data-end="225.81">If you're new to apt, you can probably</span> <span data-start="225.81" data-end="230.04">guess that by replacing gnupg2 with whatever package name</span> <span data-start="230.04" data-end="233.082">you want, it will install that package.</span> <span data-start="233.082" data-end="234.54">Now, finding the right package name</span> <span data-start="234.54" data-end="236.86">can sometimes be the tricky part.</span> <span data-start="236.86" data-end="240.13">Note, as we continue with this video and other terminal</span> <span data-start="240.13" data-end="242.555">commands, I won't read every line out loud.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="242.555" data-end="244.18">But as mentioned, I will provide a link</span> <span data-start="244.18" data-end="247.47">at the end that has them all.</span> <span data-start="247.47" data-end="251.1">Now that the dependency is installed, let's get Node.js.</span> <span data-start="251.1" data-end="256.07">Run this cURL command followed by another apt install command</span> <span data-start="256.07" data-end="258.12">for node.</span> <span data-start="258.12" data-end="258.93">That's it.</span> <span data-start="258.93" data-end="261.399">Node.js is ready to go.</span> <span data-start="261.399" data-end="262.62">Don't believe me?</span> <span data-start="262.62" data-end="264.71">Well, let's try it out with PROXX.</span> <span data-start="264.71" data-end="269.58">Use git to clone the PROXX repo and NPM to install, build,</span> <span data-start="269.58" data-end="272.58">and serve the PROXX web app.</span> <span data-start="272.58" data-end="276.54">Navigate to localhost:8080 in your web browser and check it</span> <span data-start="276.54" data-end="278.21">out.</span> <span data-start="278.21" data-end="279.29">Pretty cool.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="279.29" data-end="281.94">So much minesweeping to be done.</span> <span data-start="281.94" data-end="283.61">Let's try React.</span> <span data-start="283.61" data-end="288.2">Using NPM, you can install, create-react-app,</span> <span data-start="288.2" data-end="291.86">then use create-react-app to create a skeleton project.</span> <span data-start="291.86" data-end="295.67">Here, I call it hello-world-react.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="295.67" data-end="298.73">Navigate into the directory where it was created</span> <span data-start="298.73" data-end="302.28">and call npm start.</span> <span data-start="302.28" data-end="306.09">Now, navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser and check it</span> <span data-start="306.09" data-end="308.33">out.</span> <span data-start="308.33" data-end="311.35">If you prefer Angular, install that, too.</span> <span data-start="311.35" data-end="313.76">The steps are almost the same.</span> <span data-start="313.76" data-end="319.58">Again, we use NPM to install @angular/cli.</span> <span data-start="319.58" data-end="324.2">Create an Angular app using ng new my-angular-project.</span> <span data-start="324.2" data-end="326">Change directories into the project</span> <span data-start="326" data-end="330.95">folder using cd, for change directory, my-angular-project.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="330.95" data-end="335.51">Now, in gServ, browse to localhost:4200 and check it</span> <span data-start="335.51" data-end="336.76">out.</span> <span data-start="336.76" data-end="339.67">Here, you'll notice that I have PROXX, a React</span> <span data-start="339.67" data-end="343.24">app, and an Angular app all running on different ports</span> <span data-start="343.24" data-end="345.31">all on the same Chromebook.</span> <span data-start="345.31" data-end="346.96">I think this is pretty handy.</span> <span data-start="346.96" data-end="349.69">What's more, this is all local, so</span> <span data-start="349.69" data-end="351.85">as long as your tools are already installed,</span> <span data-start="351.85" data-end="354.4">you could do all of your development offline — </span> <span data-start="354.4" data-end="356.9">say, like on a plane.</span> <span data-start="356.9" data-end="358.19">What about Docker?</span> <span data-start="358.19" data-end="359.4">No problem.</span> <span data-start="359.4" data-end="361.85">Again, we're going to follow the normal Linux installation</span> <span data-start="361.85" data-end="363.09">steps.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="363.09" data-end="366.08">First, we double-check that all the dependencies are installed.</span> <span data-start="366.08" data-end="369.05">We add the Docker repository to apt,</span> <span data-start="369.05" data-end="372.44">and then we update the apt package list since we just</span> <span data-start="372.44" data-end="374.15">added a new repository.</span> <span data-start="374.15" data-end="377.72">We use sudo apt update to do this.</span> <span data-start="377.72" data-end="379.89">Then install Docker.</span> <span data-start="379.89" data-end="382.22">Test it out by running hello-world.</span> <span data-start="382.22" data-end="385.058">This is done with sudo docker run hello-world.</span> <span data-start="385.058" data-end="386.6">You should get a nice message showing</span> <span data-start="386.6" data-end="387.77">that everything is working.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="387.77" data-end="389.27">Let's do something a little bit more</span> <span data-start="389.27" data-end="393.23">advanced by running an Ubuntu Linux container in Docker.</span> <span data-start="393.23" data-end="396.84">sudo docker run -it ubuntu bash.</span> <span data-start="396.84" data-end="397.85">And there you go.</span> <span data-start="397.85" data-end="400.04">Your output is going to look something like this.</span> <span data-start="400.04" data-end="402.89">In the Ubuntu container, I've taken a look at the OS version</span> <span data-start="402.89" data-end="410.15">with cat /etc/os-version and you can see, it's really Ubuntu.</span> <span data-start="410.15" data-end="414.47">Now, once an app is ready to deploy, it should be tested.</span> <span data-start="414.47" data-end="417.62">Because Chromebooks have web, Android, and Linux,</span> <span data-start="417.62" data-end="421.44">you can test across multiple browsers on multiple platforms</span> <span data-start="421.44" data-end="423.35">all right on the same device.</span> <span data-start="423.35" data-end="427.52">Let's install a whole pile of browsers to prove this point.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="427.52" data-end="432.56">Using the Terminal and apt, install Firefox for Linux.</span> <span data-start="432.56" data-end="435.41">Note in Debian, the package name is firefox-esr.</span> <span data-start="437.93" data-end="442.25">Then let's also install the Chromium browser for Linux.</span> <span data-start="442.25" data-end="443.49">Feeling brave?</span> <span data-start="443.49" data-end="446.06">Let's install the Brave browser for Linux.</span> <span data-start="446.06" data-end="448.37">I won't walk through all of these lines right now,</span> <span data-start="448.37" data-end="450.71">but again, they are just the standard installation</span> <span data-start="450.71" data-end="453.38">instructions for Debian Linux.</span> <span data-start="453.38" data-end="458.15">We install the GPG key, we install the repo, and finally</span> <span data-start="458.15" data-end="460.25">Brave.</span> <span data-start="460.25" data-end="465.368">Now, if four browsers aren't enough, let's add a few more.</span> <span data-start="465.368" data-end="466.785">Head over to the Google Play Store</span> <span data-start="466.785" data-end="469.61">and install some Android browsers.</span> <span data-start="469.61" data-end="473.87">Let's go with Firefox for Android, Opera for Android,</span> <span data-start="473.87" data-end="475.76">and Chrome Beta for Android.</span> <span data-start="475.76" data-end="478.8">We now have seven browsers installed,</span> <span data-start="478.8" data-end="482.87">which can give us a reasonable first attempt at test coverage.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="482.87" data-end="486.81">We have the Chrome OS Chrome browser,</span> <span data-start="486.81" data-end="491.21">three Android browsers —  that is Firefox, Chrome Beta,</span> <span data-start="491.21" data-end="492.78">and Opera — </span> <span data-start="492.78" data-end="497.81">three Linux browsers —  Firefox for Linux, Brave, and Chromium.</span> <span data-start="497.81" data-end="500.51">And here you can see that our PROXX web</span> <span data-start="500.51" data-end="502.62">app is running on all seven.</span> <span data-start="502.62" data-end="504.35">One last thing to mention.</span> <span data-start="504.35" data-end="507.02">In case you have a mobile app that interacts with your web</span> <span data-start="507.02" data-end="510.89">service, you can do Android, TWA, and Flutter</span> <span data-start="510.89" data-end="513.14">development on Chrome OS devices, which</span> <span data-start="513.14" data-end="515.21">means you can build and package your mobile app</span> <span data-start="515.21" data-end="517.94">on your Chromebook, test it right on the device you are</span> <span data-start="517.94" data-end="520.61">coding on, like any other Android app,</span> <span data-start="520.61" data-end="523.7">build your web component, start your web server,</span> <span data-start="523.7" data-end="526.25">and then test everything on multiple browsers</span> <span data-start="526.25" data-end="530.51">and see how it interacts right on the device.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="530.51" data-end="532.58">Android Studio is as easy to install</span> <span data-start="532.58" data-end="534.59">as Visual Studio Code or Atom.</span> <span data-start="534.59" data-end="538.02">Head over to the Android Studio site and download the .deb</span> <span data-start="538.02" data-end="539.997">file.</span> <span data-start="539.997" data-end="541.58">Then, you can code your app like you'd</span> <span data-start="541.58" data-end="544.97">expect in Android Studio with one cool difference.</span> <span data-start="544.97" data-end="548.87">You'll notice that you can push directly to the Chromebook</span> <span data-start="548.87" data-end="550.1">you're working on.</span> <span data-start="550.1" data-end="551.3">Pretty cool.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="551.3" data-end="553.4">Full instructions on how to set this up</span> <span data-start="553.4" data-end="556.01">can be found on the link at the end of this video</span> <span data-start="556.01" data-end="558.42">on the Android page.</span> <span data-start="558.42" data-end="560.99">So with your Chromebook, you can build web apps</span> <span data-start="560.99" data-end="563.12">with the tools you are used to, develop</span> <span data-start="563.12" data-end="566.96">and test right on device with tools like Node.js, Docker,</span> <span data-start="566.96" data-end="569.81">and Angular, test across multiple browsers,</span> <span data-start="569.81" data-end="574.37">including mobile browsers, and even test mobile app and web</span> <span data-start="574.37" data-end="576.77">interaction right on device.</span> </p>
