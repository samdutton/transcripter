<p><span data-start="0.12" data-end="0.58"><span class="speaker">Mustafa Kurtuidu</span>: Hello there.</span> <span data-start="0.58" data-end="2.487">My name is Mustafa, a UX designer at Google,</span> <span data-start="2.487" data-end="5.07">and in this talk, I'm going to be covering designing for speed</span> <span data-start="5.07" data-end="6.36">and hacking user perception.</span> <span data-start="6.36" data-end="8.96">So I'll go through some research and some design examples.</span> <span data-start="8.96" data-end="11.46">But before I get into that, I'd like to talk through a story</span> <span data-start="11.46" data-end="13.81">which will summarize pretty much most of the talk,</span> <span data-start="13.81" data-end="16.53">and that's the story of the slow elevator.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="16.53" data-end="18.66">So people often complain to building managers</span> <span data-start="18.66" data-end="20.74">that the elevator is running really slow.</span> <span data-start="20.74" data-end="22.485">So this is a big pain point.</span> <span data-start="22.485" data-end="25.72">One potential solution is to make the elevator faster.</span> <span data-start="25.72" data-end="27.18">So you can install a new motor.</span> <span data-start="27.18" data-end="28.38">You can upgrade the motor.</span> <span data-start="28.38" data-end="31.118">You can rip out the elevator, try different algorithms.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="31.118" data-end="33.66">The problem with this, though —  it's quite an expensive thing</span> <span data-start="33.66" data-end="34.42">to do.</span> <span data-start="34.42" data-end="36.76">And for legacy systems, this is really difficult.</span> <span data-start="36.76" data-end="38.788">So this parable kind of describes the web.</span> <span data-start="38.788" data-end="40.83">When new technologies or new techniques come out,</span> <span data-start="40.83" data-end="42.69">it's really difficult to rip out old code</span> <span data-start="42.69" data-end="44.29">and replace it with new code.</span> <span data-start="44.29" data-end="46.35">So what can we actually do in these situations?</span> <span data-start="46.35" data-end="48.94">Well, if we look at the problem and the pain point — </span> <span data-start="48.94" data-end="49.857">the elevator is slow — </span> <span data-start="49.857" data-end="51.357">really, from the user point of view,</span> <span data-start="51.357" data-end="53.07">it's not so much the elevator being slow,</span> <span data-start="53.07" data-end="55.2">but it's actually the waiting being quite annoying.</span> <span data-start="55.2" data-end="57.31">So if you reframe the problem, we say,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="57.31" data-end="58.59">OK, waiting is annoying.</span> <span data-start="58.59" data-end="61.59">So what can we do to actually make the waiting feel shorter?</span> <span data-start="61.59" data-end="63.99">So we say, OK, building managers will put up mirrors,</span> <span data-start="63.99" data-end="65.76">they'll install a hand sanitizer,</span> <span data-start="65.76" data-end="67.317">and perhaps they'll play music.</span> <span data-start="67.317" data-end="69.15">And this distraction technique will actually</span> <span data-start="69.15" data-end="71.41">make the whole experience feel much faster.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="71.41" data-end="73.2">So reframing the problem can actually</span> <span data-start="73.2" data-end="76.47">help us think about how we can hack things perceptively</span> <span data-start="76.47" data-end="78">for the users.</span> <span data-start="78" data-end="79.77">Because speed is broken down into two</span> <span data-start="79.77" data-end="81.75">things, real and perceived.</span> <span data-start="81.75" data-end="84.9">So looking at some of the technical speed data,</span> <span data-start="84.9" data-end="86.137">we see the "Financial Times."</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="86.137" data-end="88.47">So the "Financial Times" have this interesting algorithm</span> <span data-start="88.47" data-end="89.67">called the tipping point.</span> <span data-start="89.67" data-end="91.8">If the user comes to the website five times</span> <span data-start="91.8" data-end="93.96">a month to read five articles a month,</span> <span data-start="93.96" data-end="96.69">they're more likely to subscribe to their site.</span> <span data-start="96.69" data-end="98.52">And if they reach nine articles a month,</span> <span data-start="98.52" data-end="100.17">then they're definitely more likely to subscribe.</span> <span data-start="100.17" data-end="101.962">So they have this tipping point, the moment</span> <span data-start="101.962" data-end="104.95">the user starts accessing this five times a month.</span> <span data-start="104.95" data-end="107.32">So they'll start targeting and engaging with that user.</span> <span data-start="107.32" data-end="109.95">But what they found was by making the website one</span> <span data-start="109.95" data-end="111.87">second faster, they increased engagement</span> <span data-start="111.87" data-end="113.94">for everybody coming to the website.</span> <span data-start="113.94" data-end="117.39">So making the experience faster, from a technical point of view,</span> <span data-start="117.39" data-end="118.72">is really critical.</span> <span data-start="118.72" data-end="120.66">But also, the opposite is true.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="120.66" data-end="123">For every two seconds a site takes to load,</span> <span data-start="123" data-end="124.56">bounce rates go up by 50%.</span> <span data-start="124.56" data-end="127.52">So it's really critical to make your sites technically fast.</span> <span data-start="127.52" data-end="129.445">And from a UX point of view, when</span> <span data-start="129.445" data-end="131.82">you ask users, what's the most important thing on a page,</span> <span data-start="131.82" data-end="133.38">they always talk about speed.</span> <span data-start="133.38" data-end="135.06">As a matter of fact, the top four things</span> <span data-start="135.06" data-end="136.86">here are all about speed and perception,</span> <span data-start="136.86" data-end="138.027">if you think about them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="138.027" data-end="139.86">The bottom one, how attractive a site looks,</span> <span data-start="139.86" data-end="141.6">is quite depressing for me as a designer.</span> <span data-start="141.6" data-end="146">But on the mobile web, speed is really, really critical.</span> <span data-start="146" data-end="147.57">But what can we do as a quick win?</span> <span data-start="147.57" data-end="150.12">So we have an app called Squoosh that we released last year.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="150.12" data-end="151.92">This optimizes images on the web.</span> <span data-start="151.92" data-end="152.98">Why is that important?</span> <span data-start="152.98" data-end="155.16">Because average page content is images,</span> <span data-start="155.16" data-end="157.14">and images are really heavy.</span> <span data-start="157.14" data-end="158.28">So this is a PWA.</span> <span data-start="158.28" data-end="160.47">You can drag and drop images and start reducing</span> <span data-start="160.47" data-end="161.58">the size of the images.</span> <span data-start="161.58" data-end="164.61">And we demonstrated this at Chrome Dev Summit 2019</span> <span data-start="164.61" data-end="167.97">and showed, by taking the IO's home page image,</span> <span data-start="167.97" data-end="169.71">we reduced it by 83%.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="169.71" data-end="172.59">So we can all collectively start improving the experiences</span> <span data-start="172.59" data-end="174.9">on the web just by making images much smaller.</span> <span data-start="174.9" data-end="176.97">You can download the code here and also grab</span> <span data-start="176.97" data-end="179.88">any of the components that are useful, such as Pinch to Zoom.</span> <span data-start="179.88" data-end="181.61">And so please do check that out.</span> <span data-start="181.61" data-end="183.33">But speed on the mobile web is important,</span> <span data-start="183.33" data-end="185.73">but the perception of speed is just as important,</span> <span data-start="185.73" data-end="188.58">because what we find is at least a third of users</span> <span data-start="188.58" data-end="191.43">still feel experiences that are technically fast</span> <span data-start="191.43" data-end="192.82">actually feel really slow.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="192.82" data-end="194.92">So what can we do to actually improve that?</span> <span data-start="194.92" data-end="197.43">Well, perception and recognizable UI.</span> <span data-start="197.43" data-end="198.96">Making navigation front of center</span> <span data-start="198.96" data-end="200.73">is one small thing that you can do,</span> <span data-start="200.73" data-end="203.7">because if a button is recognized straight away,</span> <span data-start="203.7" data-end="205.44">the experiences feel faster, based</span> <span data-start="205.44" data-end="207.15">on the research that we've seen.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="207.15" data-end="209.46">So another example is making buttons</span> <span data-start="209.46" data-end="211.12">recognizable as buttons.</span> <span data-start="211.12" data-end="213.06">So the blue button here looks like a button.</span> <span data-start="213.06" data-end="214.56">It's more likely to be engaged with,</span> <span data-start="214.56" data-end="217.89">as opposed to the text button, it may be a button,</span> <span data-start="217.89" data-end="219.28">it may not be a button.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="219.28" data-end="221.25">So if a person is looking around a page</span> <span data-start="221.25" data-end="223.59">to see what they're supposed to tap or click on,</span> <span data-start="223.59" data-end="224.92">the experience feels slower.</span> <span data-start="224.92" data-end="228.24">So make your navigation items recognizable.</span> <span data-start="228.24" data-end="230.02">Also, give feedback to the user.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="230.02" data-end="232.74">So the typical life of a button is, a user will see a button,</span> <span data-start="232.74" data-end="234.582">they'll tap on a button, engage with it.</span> <span data-start="234.582" data-end="237.04">They get enraged, because they don't know what's happening.</span> <span data-start="237.04" data-end="238.457">And then they may tap on it again,</span> <span data-start="238.457" data-end="241.33">because maybe they didn't tap on it correctly the first time.</span> <span data-start="241.33" data-end="242.85">So what can we do to stop this?</span> <span data-start="242.85" data-end="244.74">Well, just giving back feedback mechanisms</span> <span data-start="244.74" data-end="246.75">like the ripple that we have in Material Design</span> <span data-start="246.75" data-end="248.97">can help, because on touchscreen devices,</span> <span data-start="248.97" data-end="250.08">you won't have a hover.</span> <span data-start="250.08" data-end="252.39">So just giving reassurances to the user</span> <span data-start="252.39" data-end="254.88">is a small thing to actually change the perceptive speed</span> <span data-start="254.88" data-end="256.86">of an actual experience.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="256.86" data-end="258.64">Progression is really key here as well,</span> <span data-start="258.64" data-end="261.813">giving users some indication how long something takes to load.</span> <span data-start="261.813" data-end="263.73">One interesting thing in research that we find</span> <span data-start="263.73" data-end="265.53">is ripples that animate towards the left</span> <span data-start="265.53" data-end="268.38">feel faster than other forms of progression.</span> <span data-start="268.38" data-end="269.88">So if you can see in this animation,</span> <span data-start="269.88" data-end="272.19">they're all the same, but the one third from bottom</span> <span data-start="272.19" data-end="273.33">feels faster.</span> <span data-start="273.33" data-end="275.94">In YouTube, what we do is we will stagger the progress</span> <span data-start="275.94" data-end="277.885">bar across the top just a little bit because,</span> <span data-start="277.885" data-end="279.51">it gives this anticipation and hanging,</span> <span data-start="279.51" data-end="281.052">so it feels like the site is loading.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="281.052" data-end="283.045">Again, this is a small perceptive thing</span> <span data-start="283.045" data-end="285.42">that hacks the perception that the experience is actually</span> <span data-start="285.42" data-end="286.573">in progress.</span> <span data-start="286.573" data-end="288.99">One other thing that you can do is skeleton screens, which</span> <span data-start="288.99" data-end="290.98">are placeholders for content.</span> <span data-start="290.98" data-end="292.92">So one thing that you don't want to do,</span> <span data-start="292.92" data-end="295.5">in the scale of good to bad, is a blank screen.</span> <span data-start="295.5" data-end="297.81">You want to make sure you show something.</span> <span data-start="297.81" data-end="300.38">The next thing along is an actual spinner.</span> <span data-start="300.38" data-end="302.047">Spinners are better than showing nothing</span> <span data-start="302.047" data-end="303.713">going into an experience, but they still</span> <span data-start="303.713" data-end="305.34">don't give any clear indication of what</span> <span data-start="305.34" data-end="307.62">and when something is actually coming.</span> <span data-start="307.62" data-end="310.98">A replacement of that would be the skeleton screen.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="310.98" data-end="313.22">Now, when you ask users about skeleton screens,</span> <span data-start="313.22" data-end="315.26">generally speaking, they'll say gray boxes makes</span> <span data-start="315.26" data-end="316.74">the experience feel broken.</span> <span data-start="316.74" data-end="318.98">And there's this mass reveal, which isn't great,</span> <span data-start="318.98" data-end="321.11">because conceptually, it's the same as the spinner.</span> <span data-start="321.11" data-end="323.09">What we really will need to do is</span> <span data-start="323.09" data-end="325.7">have metadata giving an indication to the user</span> <span data-start="325.7" data-end="328.08">as to what is coming above the skeletons.</span> <span data-start="328.08" data-end="329.9">The moment we have content, we load it.</span> <span data-start="329.9" data-end="333.41">And perhaps images we'll frost or show a pixelated version</span> <span data-start="333.41" data-end="335.85">first, and then load the actual full-quality image.</span> <span data-start="335.85" data-end="337.503">So you want to show at every step</span> <span data-start="337.503" data-end="339.17">some form of progression, so the user is</span> <span data-start="339.17" data-end="341.45">reassured that something is definitely coming.</span> <span data-start="341.45" data-end="344.4">Now, again, this is contextual to your own experiences.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="344.4" data-end="347.03">So in YouTube, what we do is, we'll load the video first,</span> <span data-start="347.03" data-end="348.29">as opposed to the rest of the content,</span> <span data-start="348.29" data-end="350.29">even though it's the heaviest thing on the page,</span> <span data-start="350.29" data-end="352.13">because as part of the experience,</span> <span data-start="352.13" data-end="354.09">the video is the most important thing.</span> <span data-start="354.09" data-end="356.84">So again, you have to target which content pieces are</span> <span data-start="356.84" data-end="359.51">critical in your experience and load them first,</span> <span data-start="359.51" data-end="362">because the transitions that we use,</span> <span data-start="362" data-end="364.43">we want to give the feeling of progression,</span> <span data-start="364.43" data-end="365.51">rather than processing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="365.51" data-end="367.91">So we don't just show a spinner and give no indication</span> <span data-start="367.91" data-end="368.66">of what is coming.</span> <span data-start="368.66" data-end="371.48">We need to show content coming in slowly and coming out,</span> <span data-start="371.48" data-end="374.942">because it feels like a much faster, progressive experience.</span> <span data-start="374.942" data-end="376.4">And so in summary, you want to make</span> <span data-start="376.4" data-end="377.87">sure you reframe the problem.</span> <span data-start="377.87" data-end="379.4">You want to avoid blank screens.</span> <span data-start="379.4" data-end="381.86">You want to show bold animations, making sure</span> <span data-start="381.86" data-end="384.02">that you're progressing, rather than processing,</span> <span data-start="384.02" data-end="386.56">and keep navigation clear and simple.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="386.56" data-end="388.73">To find out more about the research on speed,</span> <span data-start="388.73" data-end="392.76">you can download our ebook here, called "Brain Food."</span> <span data-start="392.76" data-end="395.72">You can also check out our PWA ebook</span> <span data-start="395.72" data-end="397.97">to learn more about Progressive Web Apps.</span> <span data-start="397.97" data-end="400.3">And I also have this course on SkillShare</span> <span data-start="400.3" data-end="402.17">so you can learn about the process of UX</span> <span data-start="402.17" data-end="404.3">to help improve your experiences.</span> <span data-start="404.3" data-end="406.04">And with that, I'd like to say thank you.</span> <span data-start="406.04" data-end="409.09">[MUSIC PLAYING]</span> </p>
