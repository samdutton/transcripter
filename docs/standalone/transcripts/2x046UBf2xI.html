<p><span data-start="33.1" data-end="35.41">All right, that's awesome.</span> <span data-start="35.41" data-end="38.17">Now, I was born in India and grew up</span> <span data-start="38.17" data-end="41.76">listening to a lot of music and a lot of bands.</span> <span data-start="41.76" data-end="45.12">But growing up, I never had the opportunity or the means</span> <span data-start="45.12" data-end="48.93">to see any of my favorite bands play live.</span> <span data-start="48.93" data-end="50.94">So I listened to a lot of their music</span> <span data-start="50.94" data-end="55.23">through conventional means, tapes, radio, CDs, and so on,</span> <span data-start="55.23" data-end="56.89">and so forth.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="56.89" data-end="61.64">But I always wished I could see my favorite band live.</span> <span data-start="61.64" data-end="65.57">Now, fast forward, and just a few years ago, my favorite band</span> <span data-start="65.57" data-end="66.29">reunited.</span> <span data-start="66.29" data-end="68.99">And I was able to see them in concert.</span> <span data-start="68.99" data-end="71.046">And man, what an experience that was.</span> <span data-start="71.046" data-end="74.63">I was all the way up in the front yelling at the band.</span> <span data-start="74.63" data-end="78.84">And it was the most beautiful thing in the world for me.</span> <span data-start="78.84" data-end="82.76">But that got me thinking, what if watching a band</span> <span data-start="82.76" data-end="85.4">live at the concert was the only way for me</span> <span data-start="85.4" data-end="87.92">to get exposure to their music?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="87.92" data-end="91.56">Could I have discovered the music back home in India?</span> <span data-start="91.56" data-end="95.77">Now the beauty of music is that the original song once recorded</span> <span data-start="95.77" data-end="99.77">by the artist is available in many different formats</span> <span data-start="99.77" data-end="101.583">and over devices.</span> <span data-start="101.583" data-end="103.25">And you can listen to your favorite song</span> <span data-start="103.25" data-end="108.85">whether you are working out, you are cooking, or driving.</span> <span data-start="108.85" data-end="113.11">So in short, as a listener, I don't have to go to the music</span> <span data-start="113.11" data-end="114.93">unless I want to.</span> <span data-start="114.93" data-end="118.75">The music is available to me wherever I am.</span> <span data-start="118.75" data-end="122.63">And in the same fashion, being able to deliver amazing web</span> <span data-start="122.63" data-end="125.78">content to your user wherever the user is,</span> <span data-start="125.78" data-end="127.762">that's leveraging the power of the web.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="127.762" data-end="129.22">And we'll dive into these concepts.</span> <span data-start="131.92" data-end="136.93">So 30 years ago, exactly to this day —  which is November 12th — </span> <span data-start="136.93" data-end="139.93">Tim Berners-Lee, the man who would go on to develop</span> <span data-start="139.93" data-end="141.28">the worldwide web — </span> <span data-start="141.28" data-end="144.58">he published a proposal for linking and accessing</span> <span data-start="144.58" data-end="148.36">information over a shared interface.</span> <span data-start="148.36" data-end="153.34">His proposal was to build a web of hypertext documents</span> <span data-start="153.34" data-end="156.57">that could be viewed on a browser.</span> <span data-start="156.57" data-end="159.735">Now I remember my first experience using a browser.</span> <span data-start="159.735" data-end="161.95">It was a simple process.</span> <span data-start="161.95" data-end="165.36">You sat in front of a computer, you fired up the browser,</span> <span data-start="165.36" data-end="168.03">you typed up the destination URL, and you hit Enter,</span> <span data-start="168.03" data-end="169.665">and you got to your destination.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="169.665" data-end="171.54">And then when you wanted to do something else</span> <span data-start="171.54" data-end="174.45">or access some other site, you followed the same process</span> <span data-start="174.45" data-end="176.16">all over again.</span> <span data-start="176.16" data-end="180.81">It was a deliberate, simple, and very linear process.</span> <span data-start="180.81" data-end="183.22">And even if as devices have changed</span> <span data-start="183.22" data-end="187.62">and we now carry mobile devices that can browse the web,</span> <span data-start="187.62" data-end="190.71">the idea of going to a browser on your device</span> <span data-start="190.71" data-end="194.43">is pretty much the same.</span> <span data-start="194.43" data-end="199.21">But technology and user behavior has changed quite a bit.</span> <span data-start="199.21" data-end="202.89">Now today, the browser isn't the only way to access the internet</span> <span data-start="202.89" data-end="205.648">or connect your users to your website.</span> <span data-start="205.648" data-end="207.69">And we are in such an exciting age for developers</span> <span data-start="207.69" data-end="210.48">with so many new devices and ways</span> <span data-start="210.48" data-end="211.65">to engage with your users — </span> <span data-start="211.65" data-end="215.55">all the way from tablets, to desktops, to phones,</span> <span data-start="215.55" data-end="220.75">to newer interactive methods like the Assistant.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="220.75" data-end="224.59">So thanks to the omnipresence of all these computing devices</span> <span data-start="224.59" data-end="229.27">around us, we have entered an era of ambient computing.</span> <span data-start="229.27" data-end="232.28">And so the devices aren't the center of attention anymore.</span> <span data-start="232.28" data-end="233.26">It's the user.</span> <span data-start="233.26" data-end="236.04">It's you and me.</span> <span data-start="236.04" data-end="240.63">So how does web development evolve to address this shift?</span> <span data-start="240.63" data-end="243.4">And just like in my concert example,</span> <span data-start="243.4" data-end="245.62">it's unrealistic to expect that the band is going</span> <span data-start="245.62" data-end="249.37">to rerecord their music every single time a new content</span> <span data-start="249.37" data-end="252.39">format or a new device shows up in the market.</span> <span data-start="254.99" data-end="258.11">But before we go ahead, let me just give a quick introduction.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="258.11" data-end="259.24">My name is Dev Gogate.</span> <span data-start="259.24" data-end="261.42">I've been at Google for 10 years.</span> <span data-start="261.42" data-end="264.98">And I lead a team of web solution consultants.</span> <span data-start="264.98" data-end="267.04">And we work with developers like yourself</span> <span data-start="267.04" data-end="271.18">to build engaging web experiences using the latest</span> <span data-start="271.18" data-end="273.39">modern web tech.</span> <span data-start="273.39" data-end="274.9">And it's really amazing to see some</span> <span data-start="274.9" data-end="276.61">of the things our partners have built,</span> <span data-start="276.61" data-end="279.1">the way they have completely transformed the way you</span> <span data-start="279.1" data-end="282.58">buy movie tickets online, buy flowers online, or listen</span> <span data-start="282.58" data-end="284.05">to music online — </span> <span data-start="284.05" data-end="285.82">all using the power of the web.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="288.975" data-end="290.35">So what are the underlying powers</span> <span data-start="290.35" data-end="292.96">of the web that make it so effective in today's</span> <span data-start="292.96" data-end="294.95">environment?</span> <span data-start="294.95" data-end="297.82">So I'm here to talk about how the web can be a key building</span> <span data-start="297.82" data-end="301.51">block for building immersive user experiences based</span> <span data-start="301.51" data-end="304.12">on its primary four superpowers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="304.12" data-end="309.248">The web is capable, it's interoperable, it's imbeddable,</span> <span data-start="309.248" data-end="310.54">and it's highly transformative.</span> <span data-start="310.54" data-end="312.332">And we'll dive into each of these concepts.</span> <span data-start="314.69" data-end="317.01">But before we go any further, it's</span> <span data-start="317.01" data-end="320.07">critical to acknowledge that we learn something completely</span> <span data-start="320.07" data-end="323.88">new when we moved from desktop devices</span> <span data-start="323.88" data-end="326.25">and started carrying handheld devices that</span> <span data-start="326.25" data-end="328.77">could browse the web.</span> <span data-start="328.77" data-end="331.53">We learned that you can't just be mobile first</span> <span data-start="331.53" data-end="334.29">by taking your desktop content and just resizing it</span> <span data-start="334.29" data-end="335.89">for a different screen size.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="335.89" data-end="339.28">And this is beside the obvious performance issues.</span> <span data-start="339.28" data-end="342.15">Because a user's expectation of how they interact with the web</span> <span data-start="342.15" data-end="343.99">has completely changed.</span> <span data-start="343.99" data-end="345.42">I mean we started with typing — </span> <span data-start="345.42" data-end="347.58">keyboards and mouse, right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="347.58" data-end="352.83">And with mobile, now we are all about tapping and swiping.</span> <span data-start="352.83" data-end="355.88">And now we are on the cusp of the ambient web,</span> <span data-start="355.88" data-end="361.11">with newer interactive patterns like the Assistant and Voice.</span> <span data-start="361.11" data-end="363.28">And besides the obvious performance-related issues,</span> <span data-start="363.28" data-end="366.46">as I mentioned earlier, these new experiences</span> <span data-start="366.46" data-end="369.69">lead to a completely new user expectation.</span> <span data-start="369.69" data-end="371.26">And a lot of this is based on how</span> <span data-start="371.26" data-end="375.108">the users interact with the real-life objects around them.</span> <span data-start="375.108" data-end="376.525">So they expect a similar response.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="379.96" data-end="381.69">However, in my experience working</span> <span data-start="381.69" data-end="385.17">with a lot of our partners, I feel like the web design</span> <span data-start="385.17" data-end="388.38">process still starts with the assumption</span> <span data-start="388.38" data-end="391.74">that the user will go to a browser</span> <span data-start="391.74" data-end="395.37">and then follow the steps that we have laid out for them.</span> <span data-start="395.37" data-end="400.41">But then if we only think of website design in this format,</span> <span data-start="400.41" data-end="403.5">I think we are drastically underestimating the impact</span> <span data-start="403.5" data-end="406.62">the web can have in our lives.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="406.62" data-end="409.2">And we are undervaluing the complexity</span> <span data-start="409.2" data-end="410.64">of a real user's journey.</span> <span data-start="413.41" data-end="417.028">Now, user journeys are getting increasingly complex.</span> <span data-start="417.028" data-end="418.695">And they are actually a lot more complex</span> <span data-start="418.695" data-end="421.56">than any of our analytics or data shows us.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="421.56" data-end="423.99">Now, when we look at our analytics data,</span> <span data-start="423.99" data-end="427.26">we might look at data in terms of a user's session</span> <span data-start="427.26" data-end="429.87">or time spent on our site.</span> <span data-start="429.87" data-end="432.562">But what is the user doing in between these sessions?</span> <span data-start="432.562" data-end="434.52">Like, how are they even getting to the website?</span> <span data-start="434.52" data-end="436.37">And it's important to think about that.</span> <span data-start="439.41" data-end="443.59">Now, research shows that a digital shopper</span> <span data-start="443.59" data-end="447.44">will have almost more than 100 touch points to the web.</span> <span data-start="447.44" data-end="449.41">And this is right from the intent</span> <span data-start="449.41" data-end="451.24">to purchase something all the way</span> <span data-start="451.24" data-end="456">through discovery, research, to the actual process of buying.</span> <span data-start="456" data-end="457.5">So people are no longer following</span> <span data-start="457.5" data-end="462.75">a linear path from awareness to discovery to purchase.</span> <span data-start="469.99" data-end="472.06">Now, let's look at a real-life example.</span> <span data-start="472.06" data-end="474.82">Now, I talked about my desire to be a rock star.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="474.82" data-end="477.25">So I want to look cool and I want to buy a Gibson Les Paul</span> <span data-start="477.25" data-end="478.54">guitar.</span> <span data-start="478.54" data-end="480.34">So this whole process of me even thinking</span> <span data-start="480.34" data-end="483.64">of buying a guitar to actually finding the perfect guitar</span> <span data-start="483.64" data-end="486.07">to buy, is long.</span> <span data-start="486.07" data-end="487.72">And the journey is perilous.</span> <span data-start="487.72" data-end="491.32">And it could take me days, and months, or weeks</span> <span data-start="491.32" data-end="493.17">to find the perfect guitar.</span> <span data-start="493.17" data-end="496.24">And the process of research and discovery</span> <span data-start="496.24" data-end="500.44">happens across mobile, desktop, tablets,</span> <span data-start="500.44" data-end="503.71">and could include a combination of web search, social media</span> <span data-start="503.71" data-end="508">ad, remarketing ads, video research, and research</span> <span data-start="508" data-end="510.14">on the retailer website.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="510.14" data-end="512.24">Now, let's say at the end of all of this,</span> <span data-start="512.24" data-end="515.12">I find the perfect guitar that I want to buy.</span> <span data-start="515.12" data-end="519.019">I go to the retailer's website and I purchase.</span> <span data-start="519.019" data-end="520.73">And the journey doesn't end there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="520.73" data-end="524.42">Now, I'm really anxious to get this guitar right in my hands.</span> <span data-start="524.42" data-end="527.6">So now I'm tracking the delivery.</span> <span data-start="527.6" data-end="530.72">Maybe I'm using the Assistant to track the delivery.</span> <span data-start="530.72" data-end="533.66">Or I could use mobile web to track</span> <span data-start="533.66" data-end="536.06">the progress in the delivery.</span> <span data-start="536.06" data-end="538.67">Now, the guitar shows up and I get a push notification.</span> <span data-start="542.377" data-end="543.71">By the way, the guitar shows up.</span> <span data-start="543.71" data-end="546.53">That means I'm also really very excited.</span> <span data-start="546.53" data-end="549.92">Whether it's obvious or not, a direct browser</span> <span data-start="549.92" data-end="553.73">or a version of a Chrome Custom Tab or a WebView</span> <span data-start="553.73" data-end="557.6">is part of almost every part of this journey leading up</span> <span data-start="557.6" data-end="559.76">to the event where the guitar actually</span> <span data-start="559.76" data-end="562.04">shows up at my doorstep.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1237.84" data-end="1241.92">Figma has been using WebAssembly to run their C++ code within</span> <span data-start="1241.92" data-end="1243.55">the browser.</span> <span data-start="1243.55" data-end="1245.79">And the biggest benefit Figma saw</span> <span data-start="1245.79" data-end="1248.83">from using WebAssembly was faster load time.</span> <span data-start="1248.83" data-end="1251.97">In fact, they are seeing 3x the load time</span> <span data-start="1251.97" data-end="1254.355">after they switch to WebAssembly.</span> <span data-start="1258.08" data-end="1261.11">So let's talk about the last superpower of the web, which is</span> <span data-start="1261.11" data-end="1263.12">the web's ability to transform.</span> <span data-start="1265.81" data-end="1268.31">Now as we've seen throughout this talk,</span> <span data-start="1268.31" data-end="1271.93">the digital ecosystem is getting more and more complex.</span> <span data-start="1271.93" data-end="1275.09">And it's no longer about worrying if your page can</span> <span data-start="1275.09" data-end="1277.46">render in the browser.</span> <span data-start="1277.46" data-end="1279.89">You now have to worry about platforms, apps,</span> <span data-start="1279.89" data-end="1284.347">and new computing surfaces that all seek for your attention.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1284.347" data-end="1285.68">So how do you keep up with this?</span> <span data-start="1289.05" data-end="1292">And maybe it doesn't make sense to publish a dedicated</span> <span data-start="1292" data-end="1295.47">UI for all of these surfaces.</span> <span data-start="1295.47" data-end="1298.77">Your content might be universal, but your UI</span> <span data-start="1298.77" data-end="1302.9">is increasingly custom to a particular surface.</span> <span data-start="1302.9" data-end="1305.68">So it might be interesting to see how your published end</span> <span data-start="1305.68" data-end="1308.57">points can be seen as separate entities — </span> <span data-start="1308.57" data-end="1313.45">like, let's say, business logic, content, and UI.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1313.45" data-end="1315.91">In a typical web page loaded in a browser</span> <span data-start="1315.91" data-end="1319">all three are combined to form the user experience</span> <span data-start="1319" data-end="1320.88">that you control.</span> <span data-start="1320.88" data-end="1324.3">But you might have noticed that some of the markup that you use</span> <span data-start="1324.3" data-end="1328.188">lets your content act independently.</span> <span data-start="1328.188" data-end="1329.73">And I'm talking about structured data</span> <span data-start="1329.73" data-end="1333.78">here, which is a way to mark up your pages so platforms</span> <span data-start="1333.78" data-end="1337.29">like Google can better understand your content</span> <span data-start="1337.29" data-end="1341.82">and can transform it if necessary.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1341.82" data-end="1344.73">Now, the end result is that your web content, which</span> <span data-start="1344.73" data-end="1347.73">was previously coupled with your UI,</span> <span data-start="1347.73" data-end="1352.26">can be decoupled and transformed into a richer UI within, let's</span> <span data-start="1352.26" data-end="1354.79">say, Google Search.</span> <span data-start="1354.79" data-end="1357.88">In this example, you can see snippets, events, and products,</span> <span data-start="1357.88" data-end="1361.93">and many more areas shown here, with a very rich UI that</span> <span data-start="1361.93" data-end="1363.82">shows up within Google Search.</span> <span data-start="1363.82" data-end="1368.35">So in a way, this extends your presence beyond your core page.</span> <span data-start="1371.69" data-end="1374.3">Earlier, we talked about how the Assistant can become</span> <span data-start="1374.3" data-end="1377.72">a good referrer to your site.</span> <span data-start="1377.72" data-end="1380.69">But what if you want to trigger a quick action before it even</span> <span data-start="1380.69" data-end="1382.78">gets to your site?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1382.78" data-end="1386.4">Now, what's neat about this ecosystem is that,</span> <span data-start="1386.4" data-end="1389.32">to enable actions on Google for your content,</span> <span data-start="1389.32" data-end="1392.52">you don't have to create something from scratch.</span> <span data-start="1392.52" data-end="1397.29">Because you already mark up your pages to describe your content,</span> <span data-start="1397.29" data-end="1400.15">Google can automatically generate actions for the Google</span> <span data-start="1400.15" data-end="1403.15">Assistant with a corresponding entry in the Assistant</span> <span data-start="1403.15" data-end="1405.28">Directory.</span> <span data-start="1405.28" data-end="1407.44">So when users ask the Assistant for one</span> <span data-start="1407.44" data-end="1410.9">of the available content types, the Assistant</span> <span data-start="1410.9" data-end="1413.12">is able to serve it up easily.</span> <span data-start="1413.12" data-end="1416.09">And we are already doing this for our podcasts, recipes,</span> <span data-start="1416.09" data-end="1418.65">and news articles.</span> <span data-start="1418.65" data-end="1421.89">And as a site owner, now you can go to the console</span> <span data-start="1421.89" data-end="1425.58">and claim your site content, knowing</span> <span data-start="1425.58" data-end="1427.17">that it has already been transformed</span> <span data-start="1427.17" data-end="1429.188">for use with the Assistant.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1433.42" data-end="1438.51">So as web developers, you have made huge investments</span> <span data-start="1438.51" data-end="1440.39">in the web platform.</span> <span data-start="1440.39" data-end="1442.22">So it's only logical that you should</span> <span data-start="1442.22" data-end="1446.03">be able to leverage this when new markets or platforms open</span> <span data-start="1446.03" data-end="1447.11">up.</span> <span data-start="1447.11" data-end="1449.03">And there's a way to do that.</span> <span data-start="1449.03" data-end="1452.36">Now, recently in India, we announced the Spot Platform,</span> <span data-start="1452.36" data-end="1455.32">which is powered by Google Pay.</span> <span data-start="1455.32" data-end="1458.6">A Spot is a digital front for a business that</span> <span data-start="1458.6" data-end="1462.63">is created, branded, and hosted by the business,</span> <span data-start="1462.63" data-end="1465.1">but powered by Google Pay.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1465.1" data-end="1468.32">Now users can discover a Spot online or at</span> <span data-start="1468.32" data-end="1471.59">a physical location by scanning a QR code</span> <span data-start="1471.59" data-end="1475.01">and transact with the merchant safely and securely, all</span> <span data-start="1475.01" data-end="1478.05">within the Google Pay app.</span> <span data-start="1478.05" data-end="1480.44">Now, the good news is, a Spot is built</span> <span data-start="1480.44" data-end="1483.11">using HTML and JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="1483.11" data-end="1486.41">So as developers, you can leverage your existing</span> <span data-start="1486.41" data-end="1490.34">investments in the web and transform it into a Spot</span> <span data-start="1490.34" data-end="1494.33">by just adding a few lines of JavaScript code.</span> <span data-start="1494.33" data-end="1496.19">Now this makes it possible for a merchant</span> <span data-start="1496.19" data-end="1499.79">to have a truly scalable solution, while maintaining</span> <span data-start="1499.79" data-end="1501.65">the consistency of your user flows</span> <span data-start="1501.65" data-end="1504.12">across different platforms.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1504.12" data-end="1507.18">And Google is not the only player who is doing this.</span> <span data-start="1507.18" data-end="1509.7">WeChat lets you do something similar on their platform</span> <span data-start="1509.7" data-end="1510.2">as well.</span> <span data-start="1514.04" data-end="1517.08">So to recap the four superpowers — </span> <span data-start="1517.08" data-end="1519.31">the web is capable.</span> <span data-start="1519.31" data-end="1522.57">You can do almost anything with the web today.</span> <span data-start="1522.57" data-end="1524.1">The web is interoperable.</span> <span data-start="1524.1" data-end="1528.62">You build something once, and it works almost everywhere.</span> <span data-start="1528.62" data-end="1530.36">The web is embeddable.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1530.36" data-end="1533.45">You can embed web tech into native platforms</span> <span data-start="1533.45" data-end="1536.25">and bring native to the web.</span> <span data-start="1536.25" data-end="1538.22">And the web is transformative.</span> <span data-start="1538.22" data-end="1541.76">Your web content can adapt and seed new platforms.</span> <span data-start="1544.71" data-end="1546.92">So now that we have discussed the main superpowers</span> <span data-start="1546.92" data-end="1551.85">of the web, here are some things to ponder and reflect on.</span> <span data-start="1551.85" data-end="1555.29">Are you building high-quality content?</span> <span data-start="1555.29" data-end="1558.85">Are you building highly-performant sites?</span> <span data-start="1558.85" data-end="1561.52">Are you taking advantages of all the capabilities</span> <span data-start="1561.52" data-end="1564.85">that the web has to offer, so that you are creating the best</span> <span data-start="1564.85" data-end="1567.7">experience for your users?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1567.7" data-end="1571.63">Are you really designing for a post-destination web?</span> <span data-start="1571.63" data-end="1574.09">You know that users are accessing your site through all</span> <span data-start="1574.09" data-end="1576.52">these non-conventional means, how</span> <span data-start="1576.52" data-end="1578.38">are you ensuring that your site is</span> <span data-start="1578.38" data-end="1581.56">interoperable and embeddable?</span> <span data-start="1581.56" data-end="1584.11">Is your web presence modular?</span> <span data-start="1584.11" data-end="1585.61">Are you designing your site in a way</span> <span data-start="1585.61" data-end="1587.77">so that you can leverage your investment</span> <span data-start="1587.77" data-end="1591.377">and apply it across platforms so when a new technology comes in,</span> <span data-start="1591.377" data-end="1591.96">you are ready?</span> <span data-start="1595.62" data-end="1598.29">Now you might leave CDS today and say,</span> <span data-start="1598.29" data-end="1600.44">hey, this is all great, but I have</span> <span data-start="1600.44" data-end="1603.05">to think of all this technical debt that I have accumulated</span> <span data-start="1603.05" data-end="1605.99">and deal with all these performance issues.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1605.99" data-end="1608.91">Now, it's not that different than the sound engineer</span> <span data-start="1608.91" data-end="1612.12">at a concert who has to stare at this jumble of cables</span> <span data-start="1612.12" data-end="1614.78">and try to make things work.</span> <span data-start="1614.78" data-end="1619.46">But I ask that you leave that aside for a moment.</span> <span data-start="1619.46" data-end="1623.63">Just like fans like me demand an amazing experience</span> <span data-start="1623.63" data-end="1628.56">at the concert, we are on the cusp of the ambient web,</span> <span data-start="1628.56" data-end="1631.95">and our users are demanding an amazing and immersive web</span> <span data-start="1631.95" data-end="1634.17">experience from us.</span> </p>
