<p><span data-start="37.89" data-end="41.45">No matter how many times you've seen ad experiences like this,</span> <span data-start="41.45" data-end="44.12">it still probably throws you for a loop.</span> <span data-start="44.12" data-end="46.64">How did this one website on one device</span> <span data-start="46.64" data-end="48.6">know your search history on another device</span> <span data-start="48.6" data-end="50.577">at a completely different time?</span> <span data-start="50.577" data-end="52.16">And what else might it know about you?</span> <span data-start="55.61" data-end="60.11">Or maybe you got an email, another mystifying experience,</span> <span data-start="60.11" data-end="62.72">from your bank, telling you to log</span> <span data-start="62.72" data-end="67.37">in to verify a fraudulent charge or to unfreeze your account.</span> <span data-start="67.37" data-end="70.04">And the email looks legit, the link looks legit,</span> <span data-start="70.04" data-end="71.72">but how do you know?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="71.72" data-end="73.88">How are you really supposed to tell?</span> <span data-start="73.88" data-end="76.88">And maybe even more importantly, how is a non-technical user</span> <span data-start="76.88" data-end="77.72">supposed to tell?</span> <span data-start="81.25" data-end="84.07">The fact is, it's not always easy to tell</span> <span data-start="84.07" data-end="87.01">where you are on the web or what websites</span> <span data-start="87.01" data-end="89.56">are observing about you.</span> <span data-start="89.56" data-end="93.3">Chrome's goal is to help people with both of these problems.</span> <span data-start="93.3" data-end="95.67">We want to help users make safe decisions</span> <span data-start="95.67" data-end="98.88">while staying in control of their personal data.</span> <span data-start="98.88" data-end="101.64">And we want to do this while preserving a thriving web</span> <span data-start="101.64" data-end="104.28">ecosystem where content creators can make money</span> <span data-start="104.28" data-end="106.305">through ads without invading users' privacy.</span> <span data-start="110.54" data-end="112.22">We'll start by talking about what Chrome</span> <span data-start="112.22" data-end="114.74">is doing to help people understand where they are</span> <span data-start="114.74" data-end="117.5">on the web, what's the identity of the website</span> <span data-start="117.5" data-end="120.26">that they're visiting, and particularly,</span> <span data-start="120.26" data-end="124.01">is the site being misleading about its identity?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="124.01" data-end="125.93">As developers, this may be a problem</span> <span data-start="125.93" data-end="128.78">that your users struggle with, or maybe even</span> <span data-start="128.78" data-end="131.55">something that you sometimes struggle with, yourself.</span> <span data-start="131.55" data-end="133.43">Because even as expert users, even</span> <span data-start="133.43" data-end="136.1">for myself, as a person who works on a browser security</span> <span data-start="136.1" data-end="138.41">team, it's not always obvious when</span> <span data-start="138.41" data-end="141.113">a site is being misleading about its identity.</span> <span data-start="144.29" data-end="147.11">In theory, the URL bar that's shown</span> <span data-start="147.11" data-end="150.62">at the top of a web browser is your unambiguous clue</span> <span data-start="150.62" data-end="152.72">to website identity.</span> <span data-start="152.72" data-end="157.05">If the URL bar says Google.com, you're at the real Google.</span> <span data-start="157.05" data-end="159.8">And if it says Evil.com, you're not,</span> <span data-start="159.8" data-end="163.64">no matter how much the web content area looks like Google.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="163.64" data-end="165.41">But in practice, it's not always so</span> <span data-start="165.41" data-end="168.65">easy to tell site identity from a domain,</span> <span data-start="168.65" data-end="171.99">as you can see here with these examples.</span> <span data-start="171.99" data-end="174.84">Some of these URLs might be hard for even expert users</span> <span data-start="174.84" data-end="177.27">to notice and distinguish from Google.com,</span> <span data-start="177.27" data-end="178.71">much less non-technical users.</span> <span data-start="182.26" data-end="184.16">And this isn't speculation.</span> <span data-start="184.16" data-end="187.34">There's lots of research, lab studies, surveys, field</span> <span data-start="187.34" data-end="190.91">experiments showing that many users don't notice</span> <span data-start="190.91" data-end="193.85">or understand URLs when they need to in order to make</span> <span data-start="193.85" data-end="195.53">effective security decisions.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="199.14" data-end="202.38">In a study that we did with over 1,000 participants,</span> <span data-start="202.38" data-end="204.99">we showed users a browser window where the website looked</span> <span data-start="204.99" data-end="207.45">like a Google login page, but the address bar</span> <span data-start="207.45" data-end="210.47">said tinyurl.com.</span> <span data-start="210.47" data-end="213.98">When asked to identify this website, over 85%</span> <span data-start="213.98" data-end="216.71">of participants said the website was Google,</span> <span data-start="216.71" data-end="219.61">even though the address bar clearly said tinyurl.com.</span> <span data-start="223.94" data-end="227.04">This presents a really hard problem.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="227.04" data-end="231.23">Lots of people use URLs for lots of really useful things,</span> <span data-start="231.23" data-end="233.42">but there are also lots of ways that URLs can be</span> <span data-start="233.42" data-end="236.36">used to trick or harm people.</span> <span data-start="236.36" data-end="238.61">So what can we do about it?</span> <span data-start="238.61" data-end="241.6">We're approaching this problem from a few angles.</span> <span data-start="241.6" data-end="244.66">First, we're actively combating sophisticated spoofing</span> <span data-start="244.66" data-end="247.21">techniques that abuse URLs to create</span> <span data-start="247.21" data-end="250.21">unusually deceptive attacks.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="250.21" data-end="251.95">Second, we're drawing â€”  we're trying</span> <span data-start="251.95" data-end="255.31">to draw people's attention to the information in URLs that's</span> <span data-start="255.31" data-end="259.11">most relevant for making security decisions.</span> <span data-start="259.11" data-end="261.35">And finally, we're building specialized tools</span> <span data-start="261.35" data-end="264.77">to support expert use cases so that we can help make URLs</span> <span data-start="264.77" data-end="267.14">better security tools without interfering</span> <span data-start="267.14" data-end="268.61">with expert workflows.</span> <span data-start="272.66" data-end="274.85">We've found that sites can be particularly</span> <span data-start="274.85" data-end="276.8">misleading about their identity when</span> <span data-start="276.8" data-end="281.21">they abuse Internationalized Domain Names, or IDNs.</span> <span data-start="281.21" data-end="283.91">These spoofing sites use non-Ascii characters</span> <span data-start="283.91" data-end="287.65">in the domain to look remarkably similar to a legitimate domain.</span> <span data-start="291.22" data-end="295.51">Suppose you were looking at Example.com, as written here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="295.51" data-end="298.63">You could do a very careful, character-by-character</span> <span data-start="298.63" data-end="300.88">comparison, and you would probably</span> <span data-start="300.88" data-end="304.66">conclude very confidently that you're at the real Example.com.</span> <span data-start="304.66" data-end="306.37">There is no way this is a spoof.</span> <span data-start="309.3" data-end="312.57">But it turns out, there's a Cyrillic character that</span> <span data-start="312.57" data-end="315.462">looks identical to a Latin letter A,</span> <span data-start="315.462" data-end="316.92">so this isn't the real Example.com.</span> <span data-start="316.92" data-end="319.23">It's a completely different domain,</span> <span data-start="319.23" data-end="321.99">even though it looks the same.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="321.99" data-end="324.51">The question that browsers are faced with</span> <span data-start="324.51" data-end="327.33">is when is it safe to display non-Ascii characters</span> <span data-start="327.33" data-end="329.76">in a domain, and when does it create a spoofing</span> <span data-start="329.76" data-end="332.25">opportunity like this?</span> <span data-start="332.25" data-end="335.73">You can see that with a naive IDN display policy,</span> <span data-start="335.73" data-end="338.1">or even with a sophisticated one,</span> <span data-start="338.1" data-end="339.6">there are many interesting avenues</span> <span data-start="339.6" data-end="341.1">for spoofing that can open up.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="345.17" data-end="348.74">To combat this kind of spoofing, in Chrome 75</span> <span data-start="348.74" data-end="350.42">we introduced a new warning which</span> <span data-start="350.42" data-end="353.3">we call the Lookalike Warning.</span> <span data-start="353.3" data-end="356.96">This morning detects spoofy IDNs and shows</span> <span data-start="356.96" data-end="359.452">this page to direct the user to the legitimate site</span> <span data-start="359.452" data-end="361.16">when we think they might be under attack.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="366.31" data-end="368.67">Here's how this works under the hood.</span> <span data-start="368.67" data-end="372">When Chrome encounters an IDN, Internationalized Domain Name,</span> <span data-start="372" data-end="375.66">in a navigation, it converts it to a skeleton</span> <span data-start="375.66" data-end="379.26">using an algorithm that converts a representation of the domain,</span> <span data-start="379.26" data-end="383.25">collapsing similar looking characters into one.</span> <span data-start="383.25" data-end="386.31">We then compare that skeleton against the skeletons of very</span> <span data-start="386.31" data-end="389.64">popular sites and also sites that the user has visited</span> <span data-start="389.64" data-end="392.43">and engaged with in the past.</span> <span data-start="392.43" data-end="394.56">If there's a match among one of those sites,</span> <span data-start="394.56" data-end="397.29">we show this morning to direct the user to the legitimate site</span> <span data-start="397.29" data-end="399.58">that we think is the site they actually want to go to.</span> <span data-start="404.03" data-end="406.85">But of course, it's not only IDNs that are confusing</span> <span data-start="406.85" data-end="409.37">and that present spoofing opportunities.</span> <span data-start="409.37" data-end="412.43">Paths, fragments, and other components of the URL</span> <span data-start="412.43" data-end="414.47">can distract from the domain name, which</span> <span data-start="414.47" data-end="416.48">is the crucial indicator of identity</span> <span data-start="416.48" data-end="421.1">that users need to scrutinize to make security decisions.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="421.1" data-end="423.05">You may have noticed some changes recently</span> <span data-start="423.05" data-end="425.93">to how Chrome's Omnibox looks to help draw users'</span> <span data-start="425.93" data-end="427.43">attention to the domain name.</span> <span data-start="430.05" data-end="433.53">First, we did some user research on the extended validation</span> <span data-start="433.53" data-end="435.96">indicator in Chrome.</span> <span data-start="435.96" data-end="439.59">Extended validation is a special type of HTTPS certificate</span> <span data-start="439.59" data-end="443.5">which you can buy to tie your domain name to a legal entity.</span> <span data-start="443.5" data-end="445.71">And when you do this, your legal entity name</span> <span data-start="445.71" data-end="450.31">shows up in browser address bars, as you can see here.</span> <span data-start="450.31" data-end="452.44">The idea is that this type of certificate</span> <span data-start="452.44" data-end="454.51">relieves people, relieves end users,</span> <span data-start="454.51" data-end="457.54">from having to understand site identity from URLs,</span> <span data-start="457.54" data-end="459.31">because they should be able to discern it</span> <span data-start="459.31" data-end="460.67">from the EV indicator instead.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="464.43" data-end="466.77">From our user research, though, we</span> <span data-start="466.77" data-end="468.72">found that EV certificates don't really</span> <span data-start="468.72" data-end="472.2">help people understand site identity today.</span> <span data-start="472.2" data-end="474.15">For EV to be effective, people need</span> <span data-start="474.15" data-end="476.22">to notice when it's missing, because that</span> <span data-start="476.22" data-end="478.47">indicates a possible attack.</span> <span data-start="478.47" data-end="481.23">But we found that they didn't.</span> <span data-start="481.23" data-end="483.42">There have also been some recent proof</span> <span data-start="483.42" data-end="485.64">of concept attacks showing that EV can even</span> <span data-start="485.64" data-end="489.36">be abused to show actively misleading site identity</span> <span data-start="489.36" data-end="490.75">information in the address bar.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="493.98" data-end="497.67">So in Chrome 77, we moved the EV indicator</span> <span data-start="497.67" data-end="500.52">into page info, which is this UI surface</span> <span data-start="500.52" data-end="504.45">that you see when you click on the lock icon in Chrome.</span> <span data-start="504.45" data-end="507.21">If you have an EV certificate for your website</span> <span data-start="507.21" data-end="510">and you're wondering where the EV indicator went,</span> <span data-start="510" data-end="511.8">this is where.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="511.8" data-end="514.39">This is in line with our general philosophy on Chrome</span> <span data-start="514.39" data-end="518.13">that users should be able to assume security by default</span> <span data-start="518.13" data-end="521.309">and will warn when something is wrong,</span> <span data-start="521.309" data-end="524.37">rather than, we don't want to be presenting positive indicators</span> <span data-start="524.37" data-end="526.535">and relying on users noticing their absence,</span> <span data-start="526.535" data-end="528.66">because we've found that just doesn't work as well.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="532.55" data-end="534.49">We also recently launched a change</span> <span data-start="534.49" data-end="538.8">to simplify how URLs themselves are displayed in the Omnibox.</span> <span data-start="538.8" data-end="546.25">This scheme, HTTPS or HTTP, and the very common subdomain www,</span> <span data-start="546.25" data-end="550.4">don't add much information for many users.</span> <span data-start="550.4" data-end="551.99">The scheme is most useful for telling</span> <span data-start="551.99" data-end="554.58">whether the connection is secure or not,</span> <span data-start="554.58" data-end="556.76">but we already represent that visually with a lock</span> <span data-start="556.76" data-end="559.71">icon or a not secure a badge.</span> <span data-start="559.71" data-end="561.71">Besides, we want it to be so that you don't have</span> <span data-start="561.71" data-end="564.74">to specifically check when a connection is HTTPS by looking</span> <span data-start="564.74" data-end="569.96">for this scheme, because Chrome will warn you when it isn't.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="916.21" data-end="918.31">Just like most homeowners get a professional</span> <span data-start="918.31" data-end="921.13">to do their electrical work, lots of websites</span> <span data-start="921.13" data-end="923.86">have third party experts to do their analytics</span> <span data-start="923.86" data-end="928.22">or their video serving or other specialized functions for them.</span> <span data-start="928.22" data-end="931.72">Third parties are great, and the fact that this is possible</span> <span data-start="931.72" data-end="932.68">is pretty amazing.</span> <span data-start="932.68" data-end="937.21">Composability is one of the web's superpowers.</span> <span data-start="937.21" data-end="941.31">One huge role third parties play today is ads.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="941.31" data-end="944.91">Sure, Google and Facebook put ads on their own sites,</span> <span data-start="944.91" data-end="946.65">but that's not what I'm talking about.</span> <span data-start="946.65" data-end="950.19">Most ads on the web come from third parties.</span> <span data-start="950.19" data-end="953.01">When you visit a news site, it probably has</span> <span data-start="953.01" data-end="956.13">ads that were placed there â€”  could be by Google or Facebook,</span> <span data-start="956.13" data-end="957.96">or could be by 100 other companies</span> <span data-start="957.96" data-end="959.82">in the ad-placing business.</span> <span data-start="959.82" data-end="961.23">And that's great, too.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="961.23" data-end="965.13">Sites across the web, full of important and useful content</span> <span data-start="965.13" data-end="968.1">that people get to see for free, support themselves</span> <span data-start="968.1" data-end="970.2">with tens of billions of dollars a year</span> <span data-start="970.2" data-end="973.937">from ads placed by third parties.</span> <span data-start="973.937" data-end="975.77">But there's a problem with the system today,</span> <span data-start="975.77" data-end="977.35">and I'm sure you know what it is.</span> </p>
