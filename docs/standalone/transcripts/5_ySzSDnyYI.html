<p><span data-start="0.228" data-end="1.77"><span class="speaker">Tom Greenaway</span>: Hi, I'm Tom Greenaway,</span> <span data-start="1.77" data-end="4.44">and I'm the games lead for the Web Developer Relations team</span> <span data-start="4.44" data-end="5.97">here at Google.</span> <span data-start="5.97" data-end="8.91">Now I know what you might be thinking, web games,</span> <span data-start="8.91" data-end="10.65">is that really a thing?</span> <span data-start="10.65" data-end="13.39">Isn't flash a little bit passe?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="13.39" data-end="16.71">And compared to native mobile games on Android and iPhone,</span> <span data-start="16.71" data-end="18.81">can the web really even compete?</span> <span data-start="18.81" data-end="21.09">Well, in this Lightning Talk, I will quickly</span> <span data-start="21.09" data-end="22.68">highlight some of the opportunities</span> <span data-start="22.68" data-end="26.49">but also the challenges that the web offers to game developers.</span> <span data-start="26.49" data-end="29.49">I'll touch on topics such as why raw performance isn't</span> <span data-start="29.49" data-end="32.049">the most important thing in a game, what</span> <span data-start="32.049" data-end="34.98">the major strengths and the weaknesses of the web are,</span> <span data-start="34.98" data-end="37.17">and lastly, a few examples of game design</span> <span data-start="37.17" data-end="41.28">patents you can use to leverage when designing for the web.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="41.28" data-end="44.23">So firstly, the raw performance of the device or the games</span> <span data-start="44.23" data-end="45.21">built for it.</span> <span data-start="45.21" data-end="48.18">That's what decides the most successful games and platforms,</span> <span data-start="48.18" data-end="49.29">right?</span> <span data-start="49.29" data-end="50.73">Well, not really.</span> <span data-start="50.73" data-end="52.44">In the history of game development,</span> <span data-start="52.44" data-end="54.39">usually it's the platforms and the games that</span> <span data-start="54.39" data-end="58.41">deliver some kind of mixture of innovation, ease of access,</span> <span data-start="58.41" data-end="61.14">and last but not least, fun.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="61.14" data-end="65.28">In fact, I would say fun is the most important factor in games,</span> <span data-start="65.28" data-end="68.85">much more important than the graphical fidelity.</span> <span data-start="68.85" data-end="71.61">But let's dive into these three properties a little bit more</span> <span data-start="71.61" data-end="73.92">in depth with some examples.</span> <span data-start="73.92" data-end="77.22">So innovation, think about when the first motion-controlled</span> <span data-start="77.22" data-end="78.47">games took off.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="78.47" data-end="81.6">The best-selling console out of the Playstation 3, the Xbox</span> <span data-start="81.6" data-end="84.36">360, and the Nintendo Wii, it was</span> <span data-start="84.36" data-end="87.18">the latter, the console with the weakest performance</span> <span data-start="87.18" data-end="91.08">but the most hardware innovation and ease of access.</span> <span data-start="91.08" data-end="93.37">Well, this can mean many things.</span> <span data-start="93.37" data-end="96">Whether games are easy to buy and download</span> <span data-start="96" data-end="99.48">or whether a device is portable and always with you.</span> <span data-start="99.48" data-end="101.7">This is one of the reasons why mobile gaming has</span> <span data-start="101.7" data-end="103.86">boomed over the last decade.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="103.86" data-end="106.26">The Google Play store and the Apple App Store</span> <span data-start="106.26" data-end="108.48">have made it ridiculously easy to download</span> <span data-start="108.48" data-end="110.79">a game to your device, and these games</span> <span data-start="110.79" data-end="114.69">are right there in your pocket, always ready to play.</span> <span data-start="114.69" data-end="116.76">And lastly, what about fun?</span> <span data-start="116.76" data-end="119.81">Some of the most successful mobile games of all time</span> <span data-start="119.81" data-end="122.79">were not pushing the graphical limits of their devices.</span> <span data-start="122.79" data-end="124.92">They focused on being fun.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="124.92" data-end="127.38">Think of the early mobile hits like Fruit Ninja</span> <span data-start="127.38" data-end="129.63">or Angry Birds.</span> <span data-start="129.63" data-end="132.45">In other words, if you play to the strengths of your platform</span> <span data-start="132.45" data-end="134.2">and make fun your priority, there</span> <span data-start="134.2" data-end="135.93">are often compelling game designs</span> <span data-start="135.93" data-end="137.7">waiting to be discovered.</span> <span data-start="137.7" data-end="139.86">So what are the strengths of your platform?</span> <span data-start="139.86" data-end="142.8">What are the strengths of the web?</span> <span data-start="142.8" data-end="145.89">Well firstly, it's the most open and biggest platform</span> <span data-start="145.89" data-end="147.6">that's ever been created.</span> <span data-start="147.6" data-end="151.47">Nearly every device in the world has a web browser.</span> <span data-start="151.47" data-end="154.05">And there are no limits on how you can monetize — </span> <span data-start="154.05" data-end="156.69">micro transactions, subscriptions, paywalls,</span> <span data-start="156.69" data-end="157.59">or ads.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="157.59" data-end="160.74">There are no rules on the web, right?</span> <span data-start="160.74" data-end="164.07">And the web is instantaneous and almost frictionless.</span> <span data-start="164.07" data-end="166.2">With just a tap, the user can jump</span> <span data-start="166.2" data-end="169.23">into your content via a link they find anywhere,</span> <span data-start="169.23" data-end="172.17">whether that's on the web or inside of an app.</span> <span data-start="172.17" data-end="174.18">But like the hero of any great story,</span> <span data-start="174.18" data-end="177.36">these strengths are also the web's greatest weaknesses.</span> <span data-start="177.36" data-end="179.4">It runs on almost all devices.</span> <span data-start="179.4" data-end="181.32">So to take full advantage of that,</span> <span data-start="181.32" data-end="183.93">you must design your game to be responsive</span> <span data-start="183.93" data-end="187.35">and to be aware of different devices, screen resolutions,</span> <span data-start="187.35" data-end="190.65">and potentially develop for the lowest common denominator.</span> <span data-start="190.65" data-end="195.04">For example, mobile safari only supports WebGL 1.0.</span> <span data-start="195.04" data-end="196.35">And what about payments?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="196.35" data-end="198.75">Well, the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store</span> <span data-start="198.75" data-end="202.14">ushered in a new era of simple and trusted payment processing,</span> <span data-start="202.14" data-end="204.39">and in-app purchases were created.</span> <span data-start="204.39" data-end="206.94">And sadly, the web doesn't have built-in payment methods</span> <span data-start="206.94" data-end="210.48">like this, which means that there's a higher friction when</span> <span data-start="210.48" data-end="213.03">users are being asked to pay.</span> <span data-start="213.03" data-end="216.12">However, there are a lot of web platforms and APIs</span> <span data-start="216.12" data-end="219.36">which help alleviate this problem, such as Google Pay</span> <span data-start="219.36" data-end="224.34">Stripe, PayPal, and even browser APIs, like web payments.</span> <span data-start="224.34" data-end="226.32">And lastly, the instantaneousness</span> <span data-start="226.32" data-end="227.91">of the web that I mentioned?</span> <span data-start="227.91" data-end="231.06">Yes, it's great that a user can load your content instantly.</span> <span data-start="231.06" data-end="232.74">But to make that really work, you</span> <span data-start="232.74" data-end="236.25">need to fine tune your content to load as fast as possible.</span> <span data-start="236.25" data-end="239.28">And the weakness is that just as easily as a user open your web</span> <span data-start="239.28" data-end="241.44">page, they can close it as well.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="241.44" data-end="244.83">The ephemerality of the web is both powerful and yet fragile</span> <span data-start="244.83" data-end="246.63">at the same time.</span> <span data-start="246.63" data-end="248.07">But if you play your cards right,</span> <span data-start="248.07" data-end="250.23">you can make a game successful on the web</span> <span data-start="250.23" data-end="252.24">by leaning on these strengths and mitigating</span> <span data-start="252.24" data-end="254.01">these weaknesses.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="254.01" data-end="256.44">So what's the most unique feature of the web</span> <span data-start="256.44" data-end="259.41">that we can hone in on with our game design?</span> <span data-start="259.41" data-end="260.94">It's the link.</span> <span data-start="260.94" data-end="264.1">The beauty of the web browser is that just as easily as you</span> <span data-start="264.1" data-end="266.94">were linked to a piece of content, you, as a user,</span> <span data-start="266.94" data-end="270.57">know that you can now share that link to someone else.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="270.57" data-end="273.39">And so that cycle of being linked and then linking others</span> <span data-start="273.39" data-end="276.51">to content, that's the power of the web, really.</span> <span data-start="276.51" data-end="277.38">It's viral.</span> <span data-start="277.38" data-end="279.51">It's the modern day, word-of-mouth marketing</span> <span data-start="279.51" data-end="281.01">machine.</span> <span data-start="281.01" data-end="285.6">So how can you work the link itself into your game design?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="285.6" data-end="287.91">The key is that we want to drive virality.</span> <span data-start="287.91" data-end="290.94">We want to give the user a reason to share the game</span> <span data-start="290.94" data-end="293.34">and for the link that they share to be meaningful</span> <span data-start="293.34" data-end="296.97">not just to them, but to others as well.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="296.97" data-end="300.07">So what interesting information can be shared in a link?</span> <span data-start="300.07" data-end="303.76">Well, here are three categories you can experiment with — </span> <span data-start="303.76" data-end="307.99">competition, collaboration, and exploration.</span> <span data-start="307.99" data-end="311.56">But what would the URLs of these games really look like?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="311.56" data-end="313.87">Well, I could create a puzzle in a game,</span> <span data-start="313.87" data-end="317.14">and then I could share a URL, and that URL</span> <span data-start="317.14" data-end="320.02">could be a playable link to that particular puzzle.</span> <span data-start="320.02" data-end="324.01">Or I could finish a level and I could share the URL.</span> <span data-start="324.01" data-end="326.41">And what I share could be a player ghost</span> <span data-start="326.41" data-end="329.89">of me completing that level for others to compete against.</span> <span data-start="329.89" data-end="332.5">And lastly, I could be playing a rogue-like game,</span> <span data-start="332.5" data-end="334.96">discovering new areas of the world,</span> <span data-start="334.96" data-end="337.12">and I could find a secret room.</span> <span data-start="337.12" data-end="339.13">And then if I share the URL, that</span> <span data-start="339.13" data-end="341.26">could teleport a friend into that same room</span> <span data-start="341.26" data-end="342.46">that I've discovered.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="342.46" data-end="344.65">Now for example, here is a game called</span> <span data-start="344.65" data-end="348.16">Shellshock.io where players compete in a quake style arena</span> <span data-start="348.16" data-end="349.18">shootout.</span> <span data-start="349.18" data-end="351.4">If the player shares that current URL,</span> <span data-start="351.4" data-end="354.49">their friends can deep link into that exact room the player is</span> <span data-start="354.49" data-end="356.38">in and compete against them.</span> <span data-start="356.38" data-end="359.92">Also here's a little game I made called Space Board, built</span> <span data-start="359.92" data-end="363.04">using the slick game development tool Construct,</span> <span data-start="363.04" data-end="365.23">which, by the way, not only produces</span> <span data-start="365.23" data-end="367.81">HTML5 games for the web, but is, unto</span> <span data-start="367.81" data-end="371.11">itself, an entirely web-based development environment.</span> <span data-start="371.11" data-end="372.82">So I designed this game to demonstrate</span> <span data-start="372.82" data-end="374.92">how your URLs can be used to transmit data</span> <span data-start="374.92" data-end="376.81">for the purposes of game design.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="376.81" data-end="380.29">And inside of it is a level editor I built into the game.</span> <span data-start="380.29" data-end="383.29">When you play the game, you can send a link,</span> <span data-start="383.29" data-end="385.9">and the link contains the entire level's design</span> <span data-start="385.9" data-end="387.1">that you've created.</span> <span data-start="387.1" data-end="390.01">Here on the left is the game itself being played.</span> <span data-start="390.01" data-end="390.85">Try it out.</span> <span data-start="390.85" data-end="393.82">The game can be played on desktop or on mobile.</span> <span data-start="393.82" data-end="396.25">And why am I showing a QR code as well?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="396.25" data-end="399.04">Well, because QR codes can be a marketing tool for promoting</span> <span data-start="399.04" data-end="401.23">content in the physical world.</span> <span data-start="401.23" data-end="404.06">If you access that URL in the QR code,</span> <span data-start="404.06" data-end="405.46">it will take you to another level</span> <span data-start="405.46" data-end="408.43">I made, but this one's a little bit more intense.</span> <span data-start="408.43" data-end="410.77">Now you can imagine that Space Board could also</span> <span data-start="410.77" data-end="413.68">generate QR codes of levels that could</span> <span data-start="413.68" data-end="416.74">be shared with a friend in person as well.</span> <span data-start="416.74" data-end="420.28">So in summary, if you're curious about the web's potential</span> <span data-start="420.28" data-end="422.05">for game developers, think about how</span> <span data-start="422.05" data-end="424.93">you can play to the strengths of the platform.</span> <span data-start="424.93" data-end="428.2">Support as many devices as possible, think outside the box</span> <span data-start="428.2" data-end="430.42">when building your monetization model,</span> <span data-start="430.42" data-end="432.82">and build your game to load as fast as possible</span> <span data-start="432.82" data-end="436.6">so users can jump into it and play your game instantly.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="436.6" data-end="439.32">But most importantly, make your game fun.</span> <span data-start="439.32" data-end="442.39">Design it to be viral, to leverage the URL so users</span> <span data-start="442.39" data-end="444.13">have a reason to share it and spread</span> <span data-start="444.13" data-end="446.53">the word about your game.</span> <span data-start="446.53" data-end="449.58">Thanks, and see you next time.</span> </p>
