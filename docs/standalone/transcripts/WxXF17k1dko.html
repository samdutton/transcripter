<p><span data-start="14.89" data-end="18.4">Everyone of you here should have a phone.</span> <span data-start="18.4" data-end="27.48">So owning a phone means that each of you</span> <span data-start="27.48" data-end="31.29">have your own personal phone number.</span> <span data-start="31.29" data-end="35.46">Interesting thing is that even if you own a phone, maybe</span> <span data-start="35.46" data-end="38.76">you're not making a phone call every day, right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="38.76" data-end="40.77">You still call it a phone.</span> <span data-start="40.77" data-end="45.87">And the phone numbers are still playing a very important role</span> <span data-start="45.87" data-end="48.71">in your daily life.</span> <span data-start="48.71" data-end="52.35">For example, phone numbers can be</span> <span data-start="52.35" data-end="58.09">used as a digital identifier and a personal communication</span> <span data-start="58.09" data-end="60.43">channel.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="60.43" data-end="63.16">Some web services use phone numbers</span> <span data-start="63.16" data-end="69.44">to create online accounts or to build a social graph.</span> <span data-start="69.44" data-end="72.02">As a personal communication channel, of course,</span> <span data-start="72.02" data-end="73.74">you make phone calls.</span> <span data-start="73.74" data-end="75.735">And you can send text messages.</span> <span data-start="78.65" data-end="81.73">And there are a lot of online services</span> <span data-start="81.73" data-end="84.59">that heavily rely on phone numbers,</span> <span data-start="84.59" data-end="89.03">especially as a way to send SMS text messages.</span> <span data-start="89.03" data-end="95.23">These services are using SMS to let users sign up,</span> <span data-start="95.23" data-end="98.86">help users recover their accounts,</span> <span data-start="98.86" data-end="103.69">increase user security with two-step verification,</span> <span data-start="103.69" data-end="106.88">or confirm payments.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="135.1" data-end="139.51">But the challenge is this can introduce some friction</span> <span data-start="139.51" data-end="142">to their user experience.</span> <span data-start="142" data-end="148.9">To enter an OTP, the user has to open the SMS up, then remember</span> <span data-start="148.9" data-end="152.11">or copy the OTP from the message,</span> <span data-start="152.11" data-end="157.28">go back to the website, and enter that into the form.</span> <span data-start="157.28" data-end="160.13">It's so easy to make mistakes.</span> <span data-start="160.13" data-end="164.67">And sometimes you have to request a resend.</span> <span data-start="164.67" data-end="169.74">That's why we are proposing a new API called SMS Receiver</span> <span data-start="169.74" data-end="171.53">API.</span> <span data-start="171.53" data-end="174.45">Web developers can use the SMS Receiver</span> <span data-start="174.45" data-end="178.8">API to let the browser receive the SMS message,</span> <span data-start="178.8" data-end="185.43">extract the OTP, and enter the OTP on behalf of the user.</span> <span data-start="185.43" data-end="190.59">For end users, entering the OTP can be as simple as one tap.</span> <span data-start="193.43" data-end="197.95">And we have a few websites that are experimenting with this API</span> <span data-start="197.95" data-end="200.28">already.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="273.77" data-end="277.13">Giving your website the ability to send an SMS</span> <span data-start="277.13" data-end="280.16">might seem a bit scary at first.</span> <span data-start="280.16" data-end="287.36">What if someone builds a bot and spam random numbers?</span> <span data-start="287.36" data-end="292.61">To mitigate such abuse, you can use a service like reCAPTCHA.</span> <span data-start="292.61" data-end="296.45">Especially with reCAPTCHA V3, that</span> <span data-start="296.45" data-end="300.71">lets you identify bots without requiring the user</span> <span data-start="300.71" data-end="304.43">to check a box or solve a puzzle,</span> <span data-start="304.43" data-end="308.09">like picking traffic light images.</span> </p>
