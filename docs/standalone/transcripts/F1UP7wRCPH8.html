<p><span data-start="13.43" data-end="18.13">But for me, it was the year that my parents first brought home</span> <span data-start="18.13" data-end="24.48">our internet-capable computer, the Commodore Amiga 4000.</span> <span data-start="24.48" data-end="27.34">Frogger never looked so good.</span> <span data-start="27.34" data-end="28.99">Yeah, sure, WordPerfect was still</span> <span data-start="28.99" data-end="32.17">on 19 3 and 1/2 inch floppy disks.</span> <span data-start="32.17" data-end="36.49">But I had a 9,600 baud modem for the first time.</span> <span data-start="36.49" data-end="39.88">The possibilities were limitless.</span> <span data-start="39.88" data-end="41.36">Now, I grew up in Canada.</span> <span data-start="41.36" data-end="43.6">So like any self-respecting Canadian,</span> <span data-start="43.6" data-end="45.67">I have a healthy obsession for hockey.</span> <span data-start="45.67" data-end="47.89">And my team is the Edmonton Oilers.</span> <span data-start="47.89" data-end="50.68">And if I'm honest with myself, my love for computers</span> <span data-start="50.68" data-end="53.89">started because of hockey bulletin boards.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="53.89" data-end="55.93">Weeks after I got my first computer,</span> <span data-start="55.93" data-end="58.04">I had a friend of mine who said to me,</span> <span data-start="58.04" data-end="60.79">I have to download this so-called browser, called</span> <span data-start="60.79" data-end="64.73">Mosaic, and visit this thing called a URL.</span> <span data-start="64.73" data-end="71.77">Well, 22 seconds and 37 beautiful modem beeps later,</span> <span data-start="71.77" data-end="74.84">it was everything I hoped it would be.</span> <span data-start="74.84" data-end="78.43">I was on the web.</span> <span data-start="78.43" data-end="79.49">I was hooked.</span> <span data-start="79.49" data-end="82.242">I checked this website every single day before class.</span> <span data-start="82.242" data-end="83.95">That's a big deal for me, because I'm not</span> <span data-start="83.95" data-end="84.8">a morning person.</span> <span data-start="84.8" data-end="86.592">But every morning, I would wake up and have</span> <span data-start="86.592" data-end="88.18">a look at this website.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="395.98" data-end="397.967">The second is developer experience.</span> <span data-start="397.967" data-end="400.3">And Dion is going to share some of the recent work we've</span> <span data-start="400.3" data-end="404.45">done on productivity, frameworks, and open source.</span> <span data-start="404.45" data-end="407.9">And finally, the Chrome browser itself.</span> <span data-start="407.9" data-end="410.18">Parisa is going to share some of our investments</span> <span data-start="410.18" data-end="416.24">in a more helpful, inclusive experience for our users.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="416.24" data-end="419.4">But more importantly, more than all of that, I</span> <span data-start="419.4" data-end="420.902">want to say thank you.</span> <span data-start="420.902" data-end="422.86">Thank you for all of you for being here with us</span> <span data-start="422.86" data-end="426.43">this morning, and for spending two very important days with us</span> <span data-start="426.43" data-end="429.43">as you continue and we continue to invest in this broader</span> <span data-start="429.43" data-end="430.7">community.</span> <span data-start="430.7" data-end="433.3">As I said, the web is so much more than one company,</span> <span data-start="433.3" data-end="435.28">one product, or one person.</span> <span data-start="435.28" data-end="436.96">And it's about how we come together</span> <span data-start="436.96" data-end="439.03">to move the platform forward.</span> <span data-start="439.03" data-end="442.46">We're really grateful for a chance to share with you today.</span> <span data-start="442.46" data-end="445.483">And so let's go ahead and get started with Platform.</span> <span data-start="445.483" data-end="448.864">[MUSIC PLAYING, APPLAUSE]</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="492.74" data-end="496.12">So it's critical that web applications are lightweight</span> <span data-start="496.12" data-end="499">and have great performance.</span> <span data-start="499" data-end="501.58">And in both developing and developed markets,</span> <span data-start="501.58" data-end="504.67">teenagers and young adults are growing up with smartphones</span> <span data-start="504.67" data-end="506.89">and frequently computing cross-device.</span> <span data-start="506.89" data-end="509.08">These users have very high expectations</span> <span data-start="509.08" data-end="511.34">around the overall web experience.</span> <span data-start="511.34" data-end="513.85">So it's important for us to equip the web platform</span> <span data-start="513.85" data-end="516.309">with powerful app capabilities, and to ensure</span> <span data-start="516.309" data-end="519.669">the experiences remain smooth, responsive, and easy</span> <span data-start="519.669" data-end="521.78">to navigate.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="2557.94" data-end="2558.96">Yeah, OK, cool.</span> <span data-start="2558.96" data-end="2561.18">So yeah, I made them all responsive.</span> <span data-start="2561.18" data-end="2564.33">And so they're removed from the report.</span> <span data-start="2564.33" data-end="2566.67">The [INAUDIBLE] savings is all gone.</span> <span data-start="2566.67" data-end="2568.01">So we fixed it.</span> <span data-start="2568.01" data-end="2569.85">And check this out â€” </span> <span data-start="2569.85" data-end="2571.69">yeah, for all the images on the page,</span> <span data-start="2571.69" data-end="2575.19">we've reduced the total weight of images by half a meg.</span> <span data-start="2575.19" data-end="2577.745">So this is pretty cool.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="2691.38" data-end="2693.86">And so I want to share just a couple of the ways</span> <span data-start="2693.86" data-end="2697.83">that we're trying to deliver on that experience.</span> <span data-start="2697.83" data-end="2701.98">A lot of our focus has been around three key goals â€” </span> <span data-start="2701.98" data-end="2704.11">how do we make the web perform better,</span> <span data-start="2704.11" data-end="2706.11">how do we make the web more accessible,</span> <span data-start="2706.11" data-end="2709.66">and how do we make the web more safe and trustworthy.</span> <span data-start="2709.66" data-end="2711.69">So let's talk about performance first.</span> <span data-start="2711.69" data-end="2714.87">Now, we believe that the web is for everyone, no matter what</span> <span data-start="2714.87" data-end="2717.99">your device, what your internet speed,</span> <span data-start="2717.99" data-end="2720.07">or what your purchasing power.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2720.07" data-end="2722.13">And that's why we invest in performance</span> <span data-start="2722.13" data-end="2725.415">with consideration for just a huge range of devices.</span> <span data-start="2728.16" data-end="2735.47">OK, when it comes to RAM, we have senior memes, all of them.</span> <span data-start="2735.47" data-end="2739.07">And we laugh with you, but we also</span> <span data-start="2739.07" data-end="2741.77">work hard to not give you as much fodder.</span> <span data-start="2741.77" data-end="2744.44">And for memory, it's a really delicate balance.</span> <span data-start="2744.44" data-end="2747.5">Because sometimes when you use more memory,</span> <span data-start="2747.5" data-end="2751.67">it actually can lead to a faster user experience via caching.</span> <span data-start="2751.67" data-end="2754.22">And it also makes possible additional security</span> <span data-start="2754.22" data-end="2754.94">mitigations.</span> <span data-start="2754.94" data-end="2758.09">But we obviously know, if you use too much,</span> <span data-start="2758.09" data-end="2760.55">it can actually impact the user experience.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2760.55" data-end="2764.33">We have lots of people dedicated to figuring out just</span> <span data-start="2764.33" data-end="2767.03">what is the optimal usage for Chrome</span> <span data-start="2767.03" data-end="2770.6">given a user's available CPU and memory resources.</span> <span data-start="2770.6" data-end="2772.855">And we've been investing more here lately.</span> <span data-start="2772.855" data-end="2774.23">One of the things that we've done</span> <span data-start="2774.23" data-end="2776.27">is developed automated tooling so</span> <span data-start="2776.27" data-end="2780.86">that we can find memory leaks or UI jank in the wild,</span> <span data-start="2780.86" data-end="2783.62">and get engineers enough information so they actually</span> <span data-start="2783.62" data-end="2786.72">can debug and fix those issues.</span> <span data-start="2786.72" data-end="2791.66">And after a lot of work and via the help of this tooling,</span> <span data-start="2791.66" data-end="2793.5">we've made a couple of achievements</span> <span data-start="2793.5" data-end="2794.9">that we're pretty proud of.</span> <span data-start="2794.9" data-end="2797.54">So what we've seen in the past year</span> <span data-start="2797.54" data-end="2801.05">is an 8x reduction in UI thread jank in the main browser</span> <span data-start="2801.05" data-end="2802.31">process.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2802.31" data-end="2806.54">And we've also seen a 15% CPU reduction and 50% reduction</span> <span data-start="2806.54" data-end="2810.82">in physical memory for background tabs in the browser.</span> <span data-start="2810.82" data-end="2813.257">Now, that's pretty good.</span> <span data-start="2813.257" data-end="2815.999">[APPLAUSE]</span> <span data-start="2817.83" data-end="2819.64">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="2819.64" data-end="2822.06">We're proud of this work, but we totally</span> <span data-start="2822.06" data-end="2823.51">know it's an ongoing effort.</span> <span data-start="2823.51" data-end="2826.35">And this is something we're going to continue to invest in.</span> <span data-start="2826.35" data-end="2827.7">So that's the browser.</span> <span data-start="2827.7" data-end="2830.37">When it comes to V8, we've also made a number</span> <span data-start="2830.37" data-end="2832.35">of memory reductions here.</span> <span data-start="2832.35" data-end="2836.1">For example, we reduced render in the memory footprint</span> <span data-start="2836.1" data-end="2837.57">by about 5%.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2837.57" data-end="2841.44">And we actually expect further reduction of about 12%</span> <span data-start="2841.44" data-end="2844.23">via V8 pointer compression, which is literally rolling out</span> <span data-start="2844.23" data-end="2845.55">right now.</span> <span data-start="2845.55" data-end="2846.9">So more cool improvements.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2846.9" data-end="2850.3">But people want to see to believe.</span> <span data-start="2850.3" data-end="2854.28">And so you can see from this video â€” </span> <span data-start="2854.28" data-end="2856.87">within V8, we've massively reduced parsing time.</span> <span data-start="2856.87" data-end="2859.36">And so now Google Sheets loads way faster.</span> <span data-start="2859.36" data-end="2862.77">This is a comparison of Chrome today versus Chrome a year ago.</span> <span data-start="2862.77" data-end="2867.67">And again, if you're into stats, this is about 33% faster.</span> <span data-start="2867.67" data-end="2871.33">So thanks to V8.</span> <span data-start="2871.33" data-end="2873.73">And at I/O this year, we announced a couple</span> <span data-start="2873.73" data-end="2876.905">of improvements that developers just get by default.</span> <span data-start="2876.905" data-end="2878.78">And I wanted to just give an update on those.</span> <span data-start="2878.78" data-end="2881.59">So the first one that we're excited to share</span> <span data-start="2881.59" data-end="2883.87">relates to image lazy load.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2883.87" data-end="2885.88">And this is now going to be enabled</span> <span data-start="2885.88" data-end="2889.42">by default for all Chrome light mode users.</span> <span data-start="2889.42" data-end="2892.12">Now, lazy load is when the browser</span> <span data-start="2892.12" data-end="2896.47">prioritizes loading images or IFrames in the current view.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2896.47" data-end="2898.39">And so it'll actually defer loading elements</span> <span data-start="2898.39" data-end="2901.708">outside of the view until the user scrolls to it.</span> <span data-start="2901.708" data-end="2903.25">This means that all Chrome light mode</span> <span data-start="2903.25" data-end="2906.34">users are going to get even more data savings,</span> <span data-start="2906.34" data-end="2908.29">and they're going to get even faster content</span> <span data-start="2908.29" data-end="2909.5">in view experience.</span> <span data-start="2909.5" data-end="2913.54">And so that's great for default users in light mode.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2913.54" data-end="2915.07">Developers can also just enable this</span> <span data-start="2915.07" data-end="2918.6">by adding one line of text.</span> <span data-start="2918.6" data-end="2921">And then second update, and something</span> <span data-start="2921" data-end="2925.71">that's coming in a couple months is launching Paint Holding.</span> <span data-start="2925.71" data-end="2927.57">Now, Paint Holding is where the browser</span> <span data-start="2927.57" data-end="2930.69">will wait very, very briefly before starting to paint.</span> <span data-start="2930.69" data-end="2933.63">So the page renders as a whole rather than</span> <span data-start="2933.63" data-end="2935.67">jumping different elements around.</span> <span data-start="2935.67" data-end="2938.49">And it just avoids kind of what is a distracting kind</span> <span data-start="2938.49" data-end="2939.69">of white splash.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2939.69" data-end="2942.87">And so again, just by default, giving users a better, more</span> <span data-start="2942.87" data-end="2943.95">smooth experience.</span> <span data-start="2947.42" data-end="2952.07">So performance is one big area of ongoing investment.</span> <span data-start="2952.07" data-end="2955.32">But access to the web isn't just about performance.</span> <span data-start="2955.32" data-end="2959.51">It's also about making content accessible.</span> <span data-start="2959.51" data-end="2963.38">For example, users who are blind or low vision</span> <span data-start="2963.38" data-end="2967.32">are often using a screen reader or Braille display.</span> <span data-start="2967.32" data-end="2971.36">And unfortunately, these users will typically hear,</span> <span data-start="2971.36" data-end="2977.03">"image," "unlabeled graphic," or a long, irrelevant filename</span> <span data-start="2977.03" data-end="2980.87">read aloud whenever they're on a page that has unlabeled images.</span> <span data-start="2980.87" data-end="2983.5">And obviously this can be a pretty frustrating experience.</span> <span data-start="2983.5" data-end="2984.958">So this is something that we wanted</span> <span data-start="2984.958" data-end="2987.86">to help those users with.</span> <span data-start="2987.86" data-end="2991.85">Now, we used Google AI to automatically generate</span> <span data-start="2991.85" data-end="2993.08">descriptions of images.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2993.08" data-end="2996.38">So now if users turn on the Get Image Descriptions</span> <span data-start="2996.38" data-end="2998.05">from Google feature, Chrome is going</span> <span data-start="2998.05" data-end="3000.16">to automatically generate descriptions</span> <span data-start="3000.16" data-end="3001.48">of unlabeled images.</span> <span data-start="3001.48" data-end="3004.87">And so just as an example, if a user came on this image, then</span> <span data-start="3004.87" data-end="3007.21">they might actually hear, "appears</span> <span data-start="3007.21" data-end="3010.62">to be fruits and vegetables at a market."</span> <span data-start="3010.62" data-end="3014.39">So as you all know, it is still best practice</span> <span data-start="3014.39" data-end="3017.66">for developers to actually add their own Alt text to images.</span> <span data-start="3017.66" data-end="3021.663">Because you know the context of your content best.</span> <span data-start="3021.663" data-end="3023.33">But this feature is really just intended</span> <span data-start="3023.33" data-end="3025.28">to help bridge some of the existing gaps</span> <span data-start="3025.28" data-end="3027.15">that we know are present in the web today.</span> <span data-start="3030.16" data-end="3032.68">And our team has set a goal for ourselves</span> <span data-start="3032.68" data-end="3034.66">to just really meet the highest level</span> <span data-start="3034.66" data-end="3036.31">of accessibility standards.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="3138.2" data-end="3140.06">And we're going to begin blocking</span> <span data-start="3140.06" data-end="3144.863">all mixed content or insecure HTTP content loaded on HTTPS</span> <span data-start="3144.863" data-end="3148.37">pages by default. And since we're asking developers</span> <span data-start="3148.37" data-end="3153.045">to do some work as we always do, we know this takes some time,</span> <span data-start="3153.045" data-end="3155.42">and we're going to be rolling this out over the next four</span> <span data-start="3155.42" data-end="3156.11">milestones.</span> <span data-start="3159.88" data-end="3162.04">We're also experimenting with new ways</span> <span data-start="3162.04" data-end="3164.15">to make DNS more secure.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="3164.15" data-end="3166.3">So as you know, DNS is the addressing system</span> <span data-start="3166.3" data-end="3168.46">of the internet, and just a really essential piece</span> <span data-start="3168.46" data-end="3170.275">of how the internet works.</span> <span data-start="3170.275" data-end="3174.7">Unfortunately, it remains one of the last non-encrypted</span> <span data-start="3174.7" data-end="3175.57">channels.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="3175.57" data-end="3178.25">And this potentially exposes users</span> <span data-start="3178.25" data-end="3182.59">to privacy leaks, or phishing attacks, or pharming attacks.</span> <span data-start="3182.59" data-end="3185.35">And a lot of members of the web community</span> <span data-start="3185.35" data-end="3188.17">have tried to improve this over time,</span> <span data-start="3188.17" data-end="3191.89">but just nothing has really taken off until more recently.</span> <span data-start="3191.89" data-end="3194.44">Now the latest proposal from the web community</span> <span data-start="3194.44" data-end="3198.25">is called DNS over HTTPS.</span> <span data-start="3198.25" data-end="3200.59">As a browser, this obviously plays to our strengths.</span> <span data-start="3200.59" data-end="3205.19">But DNS has been around for 35-plus years.</span> <span data-start="3205.19" data-end="3209.53">And so changing it is just a really complex endeavor.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="3209.53" data-end="3212.44">And it's one that we are being really deliberately</span> <span data-start="3212.44" data-end="3213.88">conservative about.</span> <span data-start="3213.88" data-end="3218.23">So we're only going to upgrade Chrome users to DNS over HTTPS</span> <span data-start="3218.23" data-end="3221.587">if we already know that their DNS providers support it.</span> <span data-start="3221.587" data-end="3223.42">And we think that this is the right approach</span> <span data-start="3223.42" data-end="3227.95">to balance user choice and control while also delivering</span> <span data-start="3227.95" data-end="3230.68">significant improvements that we see for security and privacy.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="3234.41" data-end="3238.69">Now, if there's one topic that takes over most of the browser</span> <span data-start="3238.69" data-end="3241.18">safety and trust conversationally lately,</span> <span data-start="3241.18" data-end="3244.66">it's privacy, and in particular cookies.</span> <span data-start="3244.66" data-end="3247.323">So earlier this year, at I/O, I've</span> <span data-start="3247.323" data-end="3248.74">made some announcements that we're</span> <span data-start="3248.74" data-end="3252.61">committed to making controls for third-party cookies just more</span> <span data-start="3252.61" data-end="3254.14">usable and more visible.</span> <span data-start="3254.14" data-end="3256.75">And we've already kicked off some early experiments.</span> <span data-start="3256.75" data-end="3258.91">You can check it out in Incognito,</span> <span data-start="3258.91" data-end="3262.3">which is our mode that we know a lot of privacy-conscious users</span> <span data-start="3262.3" data-end="3263.98">will turn to you.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="3263.98" data-end="3266.02">And in parallel, we're continuing</span> <span data-start="3266.02" data-end="3269.14">to just make progress on plans to improve the existing cookie</span> <span data-start="3269.14" data-end="3270.82">infrastructure.</span> <span data-start="3270.82" data-end="3272.89">We recently announced that Chrome</span> <span data-start="3272.89" data-end="3276.4">is going to start enforcing accurate cookie classification</span> <span data-start="3276.4" data-end="3279.07">beginning in February, and in particular,</span> <span data-start="3279.07" data-end="3280.99">looking for developers to be able to specify</span> <span data-start="3280.99" data-end="3282.49">whether their cookies are to be used</span> <span data-start="3282.49" data-end="3287.29">in a first-party or third-party classification context.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="3287.29" data-end="3289.42">And this is just going to make cookies more secure,</span> <span data-start="3289.42" data-end="3293.26">and also make our tracking controls more accurate.</span> <span data-start="3293.26" data-end="3295.337">Other browsers have announced that they're</span> <span data-start="3295.337" data-end="3296.42">joining us in this effort.</span> <span data-start="3299.61" data-end="3302.61">And then one more thing I want to talk about on privacy,</span> <span data-start="3302.61" data-end="3304.86">but we're just continuing to innovate on our privacy</span> <span data-start="3304.86" data-end="3305.76">sandbox.</span> <span data-start="3305.76" data-end="3308.7">And what this is is a secure environment</span> <span data-start="3308.7" data-end="3311.76">for personalization, including ads.</span> <span data-start="3311.76" data-end="3313.83">And it also protects user privacy.</span> <span data-start="3313.83" data-end="3316.11">So since the August announcement,</span> <span data-start="3316.11" data-end="3319.05">we've announced two intents to implement â€” </span> <span data-start="3319.05" data-end="3322.71">Click Conversion Measurement and Trust Token APIs.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="3322.71" data-end="3323.44">Check them out.</span> <span data-start="3323.44" data-end="3324.54">We'd love your feedback.</span> <span data-start="3324.54" data-end="3325.92">And you'll hear a little bit more</span> <span data-start="3325.92" data-end="3330.612">about these in the next talk at 11:00.</span> <span data-start="3330.612" data-end="3333.59">Of course you can't have privacy without security.</span> <span data-start="3333.59" data-end="3336.62">And our philosophy in Chrome is that you</span> <span data-start="3336.62" data-end="3339.2">shouldn't have to be a security expert to stay safe online.</span> <span data-start="3339.2" data-end="3340.85">And so as much as possible, we try</span> <span data-start="3340.85" data-end="3344.34">to build security in by default. So since the beginning,</span> <span data-start="3344.34" data-end="3346.43">we've built in protections to just warn</span> <span data-start="3346.43" data-end="3348.71">users of potentially-dangerous sites</span> <span data-start="3348.71" data-end="3350.6">that may try to phish their credentials</span> <span data-start="3350.6" data-end="3354.95">or install malware, and then also really invest</span> <span data-start="3354.95" data-end="3358.28">in regularly updating users with the latest security</span> <span data-start="3358.28" data-end="3359.7">updates or features.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="3359.7" data-end="3362">And so I want to talk about just two things</span> <span data-start="3362" data-end="3364.63">we're proud of from this past year.</span> <span data-start="3364.63" data-end="3368.77">Passwords â€”  everyone knows about passwords.</span> <span data-start="3368.77" data-end="3371.5">Compromised passwords remain one of the biggest</span> <span data-start="3371.5" data-end="3373.19">risks to users on the web.</span> <span data-start="3373.19" data-end="3376.74">And that's why we continue to invest in our Password Manager.</span> <span data-start="3376.74" data-end="3380.83">Today, not only can Chrome users safely store their passwords,</span> <span data-start="3380.83" data-end="3384.19">but they can also generate unique, strong passwords</span> <span data-start="3384.19" data-end="3387.49">for all sites on either desktop and mobile.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="3387.49" data-end="3389.95">And what we'll be bringing to you by the end of the year</span> <span data-start="3389.95" data-end="3394">is actually a Chrome that will proactively warn you</span> <span data-start="3394" data-end="3395.95">if we detect that any of your passwords</span> <span data-start="3395.95" data-end="3397.243">have been compromised.</span> <span data-start="3397.243" data-end="3399.16">And this way, as a user, you can actually just</span> <span data-start="3399.16" data-end="3402.335">take additional protections to protect those online accounts</span> <span data-start="3402.335" data-end="3403.21">which may be at risk.</span> <span data-start="3405.92" data-end="3408.07">And then finally another accomplishment</span> <span data-start="3408.07" data-end="3410.41">is just bringing Site Isolation to Android.</span> <span data-start="3410.41" data-end="3413.14">So Site Isolation is like the next major advancement</span> <span data-start="3413.14" data-end="3414.4">in browser sandboxing.</span> <span data-start="3414.4" data-end="3418.812">And it protects users from speculative execution attacks.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="3418.812" data-end="3421.27">You may have heard of Spectre, which got a lot of headlines</span> <span data-start="3421.27" data-end="3422.86">two years ago.</span> <span data-start="3422.86" data-end="3425.41">And bringing this to Android was actually</span> <span data-start="3425.41" data-end="3427.72">only possible because of a lot of the memory savings</span> <span data-start="3427.72" data-end="3430.63">that we made that I described earlier in the talk.</span> <span data-start="3430.63" data-end="3433.735">And so kudos to the teams that have made this possible.</span> <span data-start="3436.72" data-end="3440.13">Overall, we feel a huge responsibility in Chrome</span> <span data-start="3440.13" data-end="3442.95">to continue to bring helpful innovation to just make</span> <span data-start="3442.95" data-end="3445.92">the web perform better, make it more accessible,</span> <span data-start="3445.92" data-end="3449.67">and stay ahead of users' expectations</span> <span data-start="3449.67" data-end="3451.74">when it comes to security and privacy.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="3451.74" data-end="3455.16">And I cannot underscore that this would not be possible</span> <span data-start="3455.16" data-end="3457.56">without the support of the developer community,</span> <span data-start="3457.56" data-end="3460.24">and just everybody who's contributing to the ecosystem.</span> <span data-start="3460.24" data-end="3462.76">So truly thank you so much.</span> <span data-start="3462.76" data-end="3464.72">[APPLAUSE]</span> <span data-start="3464.72" data-end="3466.68">[MUSIC PLAYING]</span> <span data-start="3468.16" data-end="3470.02">With that, I'm going to call Anil back</span> <span data-start="3470.02" data-end="3471.562">on stage just for some closing words.</span> </p>
