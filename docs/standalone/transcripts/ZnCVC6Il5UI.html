<p><span data-start="10.717" data-end="12.3">Today, I want to provide some guidance</span> <span data-start="12.3" data-end="15.21">on how you, as developers, can enhance the online checkout</span> <span data-start="15.21" data-end="17.61">experience for your customers.</span> <span data-start="17.61" data-end="19.29">Specifically, I'll walk you through how</span> <span data-start="19.29" data-end="21.42">to make payments simple and more secure</span> <span data-start="21.42" data-end="24.06">with autofill and Google Pay.</span> <span data-start="24.06" data-end="26.7">In many cases, people make online purchases</span> <span data-start="26.7" data-end="29.4">with a credit or debit card.</span> <span data-start="29.4" data-end="31.08">Providing this information is often</span> <span data-start="31.08" data-end="33.01">accompanied with requests for other details,</span> <span data-start="33.01" data-end="35.74">like a user's shipping or billing address.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="35.74" data-end="38.16">Autofill simplifies this experience for users</span> <span data-start="38.16" data-end="39.96">by making their payment details readily</span> <span data-start="39.96" data-end="42.66">available during the checkout flow.</span> <span data-start="42.66" data-end="45.3">Autofill does most of the work for the user.</span> <span data-start="45.3" data-end="48.27">And no additional effort is required by website operators</span> <span data-start="48.27" data-end="49.85">to take advantage of it.</span> <span data-start="49.85" data-end="52.343">Autofill works by providing a list of suggested payment</span> <span data-start="52.343" data-end="53.76">and contact details that have been</span> <span data-start="53.76" data-end="55.98">saved to the user's browser.</span> </p>
