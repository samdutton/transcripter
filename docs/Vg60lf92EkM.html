<p><span data-start="89.96" data-end="92.73">But it turns out JavaScript and the web is special.</span> <span data-start="92.73" data-end="95.985">And it is inherently single threaded, so you can't do that.</span> </p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="155.64" data-end="158"><span class="speaker">Surma</span>: So this becomes increasingly unlikely for you</span> <span data-start="158" data-end="159.63">to be able to do this successfully on the web</span> <span data-start="159.63" data-end="160.17">currently.</span> </p></section>

<p><span data-start="161.02" data-end="165.18">And so this is the question that we have been thinking through</span> <span data-start="165.18" data-end="166.83">for the last little while.</span> <span data-start="166.83" data-end="170.64">Is there anything we can do, anything we can suggest,</span> <span data-start="170.64" data-end="173.65">think of to help?</span> </p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="189" data-end="190.595"><span class="speaker">Surma</span>: Actor model.</span> <span data-start="190.595" data-end="192.2">So we kind of stumbled over this.</span> <span data-start="192.2" data-end="195.8">The actor model is, as it says right here, about 45 years old.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="195.8" data-end="199.28">And it's been made popular by Erlang</span> <span data-start="199.28" data-end="201.43">and then continued with Elixir and Pony.</span> <span data-start="201.43" data-end="203.6">It's languages that use the actor model to this day</span> <span data-start="203.6" data-end="205.21">and successfully so.</span> <span data-start="205.21" data-end="207.38">And we realized that it's actually</span> <span data-start="207.38" data-end="208.892">a really good fit for the web.</span> </p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="208.892" data-end="209.6"><span class="speaker">Paul Lewis</span>: Yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="209.6" data-end="213.08">Because what it does is it makes a feature</span> <span data-start="213.08" data-end="215.629">of that single-threadedness of JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="215.629" data-end="217.67">But we like to explain —  if you've come across it</span> <span data-start="217.67" data-end="218.47">before, great.</span> <span data-start="218.47" data-end="220.22">If you've not come across the actor model,</span> <span data-start="220.22" data-end="222.094">we like to explain it in a very specific way.</span> <span data-start="222.094" data-end="223.5">So check this one out.</span> </p>
<p></p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="223.5" data-end="224.93"><span class="speaker">Surma</span>: So when we did Supercharge,</span> <span data-start="224.93" data-end="226.43">you saw us on screen.</span> <span data-start="226.43" data-end="229.61">But behind the cameras, we had an entire crew.</span> <span data-start="229.61" data-end="231.83">And that means we had one person working the camera.</span> <span data-start="231.83" data-end="234.81">We had one person worrying about if our audio was good.</span> <span data-start="234.81" data-end="235.97">We had a director.</span> <span data-start="235.97" data-end="238.31">And each of these people were solely responsible</span> <span data-start="238.31" data-end="240.39">for that specific device.</span> </p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="240.39" data-end="243.74"><span class="speaker">Paul Lewis</span>: And instead of going over and pressing one person's</span> <span data-start="243.74" data-end="246.124">buttons or just messing with settings,</span> <span data-start="246.124" data-end="248.54">those people actually have to communicate with one another</span> <span data-start="248.54" data-end="249.373">to get the job done.</span> <span data-start="249.373" data-end="251.31">It you like, there are actors in the system,</span> <span data-start="251.31" data-end="253.28">but they've got to send messages to one another</span> <span data-start="253.28" data-end="255.11">and communicate and collaborate in order</span> <span data-start="255.11" data-end="258.38">to get the final thing working.</span> </p>
<p></p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="258.38" data-end="260.163"><span class="speaker">Surma</span>: So that's kind of where — </span> <span data-start="260.163" data-end="261.579">more video, more production value.</span> <span data-start="261.579" data-end="262.61">It's good, right?</span> <span data-start="262.61" data-end="265.55">So that's where we see a mentality that</span> <span data-start="265.55" data-end="267">fits the web really well.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="267" data-end="268.79">And you start thinking about, where</span> <span data-start="268.79" data-end="271.64">can you draw a line for individual pieces</span> <span data-start="271.64" data-end="273.69">of responsibility in your app.</span> <span data-start="273.69" data-end="275.72">And instead of thinking about classes and how</span> <span data-start="275.72" data-end="277.97">you call the method on the other class,</span> <span data-start="277.97" data-end="279.86">you can now think about these actors</span> <span data-start="279.86" data-end="282.38">and how you can send the right message to request something</span> <span data-start="282.38" data-end="282.99">to happen.</span> </p>
<p></p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="282.99" data-end="283.16"><span class="speaker">Paul Lewis</span>: Right.</span> <span data-start="283.16" data-end="284.82">There are these areas of ownership.</span> <span data-start="284.82" data-end="287.6">So let's think about, how, at a conceptual level,</span> <span data-start="287.6" data-end="289.699">how would you think this through?</span> <span data-start="289.699" data-end="291.24">What would it look like a little bit?</span> <span data-start="291.24" data-end="291.74">OK.</span> <span data-start="291.74" data-end="295.63">So imagine you have an actor, and it's job</span> <span data-start="295.63" data-end="297.602">is to run your user interface.</span> <span data-start="297.602" data-end="298.81">That's its area of ownership.</span> <span data-start="298.81" data-end="299.92">That's what it does.</span> <span data-start="299.92" data-end="302.18">That's its job and only that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="302.18" data-end="304.42">You might also have another actor</span> <span data-start="304.42" data-end="307.33">whose job is to handle state for your application</span> <span data-start="307.33" data-end="310.99">and yet another one who handles the storage.</span> <span data-start="310.99" data-end="313.63">Now, imagine in your app a typical interaction</span> <span data-start="313.63" data-end="316.33">would be something like favoriting an item.</span> <span data-start="316.33" data-end="318.28">The user interface, when the user taps on it,</span> <span data-start="318.28" data-end="320.17">it will send a message over to the state</span> <span data-start="320.17" data-end="322.96">that says this was favorited.</span> <span data-start="322.96" data-end="324.874">In turn, the actor handling the state</span> <span data-start="324.874" data-end="326.29">will send a message to the storage</span> <span data-start="326.29" data-end="329.92">to say we need to remember that they favorited this item.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="329.92" data-end="331.63">Now we could also, at this point,</span> <span data-start="331.63" data-end="333.999">introduce a new actor into this story,</span> <span data-start="333.999" data-end="335.29">something that could broadcast.</span> <span data-start="335.29" data-end="338.689">Because when the state changes, typically, what we'd want to do</span> <span data-start="338.689" data-end="340.48">is, we'd want to send that both to the user</span> <span data-start="340.48" data-end="344.75">interface and the storage to be reflected in both, I suppose,</span> <span data-start="344.75" data-end="345.25">really.</span> </p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="345.25" data-end="346.147"><span class="speaker">Surma</span>: Yes.</span> <span data-start="346.147" data-end="347.98">And you can kind of see here, that it really</span> <span data-start="347.98" data-end="350.906">is a separation of concerns.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="350.906" data-end="354.18">Ah, the click, there you go.</span> <span data-start="354.18" data-end="356.54">[INAUDIBLE] transition —  do recommend.</span> <span data-start="356.54" data-end="358.595">It really helps you to think about your app</span> <span data-start="358.595" data-end="360.47">in a different way, helping you to figure out</span> <span data-start="360.47" data-end="363.41">where does new code go, which module can you switch out</span> <span data-start="363.41" data-end="365.51">to fix a problem that you're having?</span> <span data-start="365.51" data-end="368.03">It's a really good way to structure the app in this way.</span> </p>
<p></p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="368.03" data-end="368.51"><span class="speaker">Paul Lewis</span>: Yeah, absolutely.</span> <span data-start="368.51" data-end="370.1">And we use to separation of concerns</span> <span data-start="370.1" data-end="372.5">when we talk about HTML, JavaScript, and CSS,</span> <span data-start="372.5" data-end="376.11">or when we talk about components in a modern framework.</span> <span data-start="376.11" data-end="379.539">So it's another version of that same story I suppose.</span> </p></section>

<p></p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="500.87" data-end="501.702"><span class="speaker">Paul Lewis</span>: Absolutely.</span> <span data-start="501.702" data-end="504.076">But with this in mind, let's talk about a particular app,</span> <span data-start="504.076" data-end="506.585">something like a stopwatch app, which you would start,</span> <span data-start="506.585" data-end="508.957">it would count up in seconds — </span> <span data-start="508.957" data-end="510.29">pause, play, that kind of thing.</span> <span data-start="510.29" data-end="515.74">And then you might reset the time if you're done.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="515.74" data-end="519.57">So in our code, we have this Actor base class.</span> <span data-start="519.57" data-end="522.659">And that top function up there, hookup, is the first thing</span> <span data-start="522.659" data-end="523.659">that you'd need to know.</span> <span data-start="523.659" data-end="526.36">And the job of hookup is to kind of register</span> <span data-start="526.36" data-end="528.74">an actor in the system so that we can talk to it later,</span> <span data-start="528.74" data-end="531.37">so we can send it messages later on.</span> <span data-start="531.37" data-end="533.02">Because ultimately, we won't know where</span> <span data-start="533.02" data-end="534.5">this actor is in the system.</span> <span data-start="534.5" data-end="537.94">And so we just need almost like a registry, I suppose,</span> <span data-start="537.94" data-end="540.6">where we can say, I'm going to tell you there's an actor,</span> <span data-start="540.6" data-end="542.02">and it's found under this name.</span> </p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="542.02" data-end="543.52"><span class="speaker">Surma</span>: It's basically the equivalent</span> <span data-start="543.52" data-end="545.32">of what you might know from custom elements.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="545.32" data-end="546.861">There's custom elements that. define.</span> <span data-start="546.861" data-end="550.33">And you say, this custom element is now known under this name.</span> <span data-start="550.33" data-end="553.709">And this does the exact same thing but for actors.</span> </p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="553.709" data-end="556"><span class="speaker">Paul Lewis</span>: So then we have our two actors, a Clock one</span> <span data-start="556" data-end="557.59">and a UI one.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="557.59" data-end="560.77">And then in the bootstrap, we instantiate both our UI</span> <span data-start="560.77" data-end="562.96">and hook it up, so it's available under UI</span> <span data-start="562.96" data-end="564.46">as a string name.</span> <span data-start="564.46" data-end="568.552">And then we do the same with the clock like so.</span> <span data-start="568.552" data-end="571.01">So now, we can talk about how you might implement something</span> <span data-start="571.01" data-end="573.62">like the clock itself.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="573.62" data-end="575.9">And in our case, when you've got something like this,</span> <span data-start="575.9" data-end="578.6">it's almost like a pure data actor.</span> <span data-start="578.6" data-end="582.05">It doesn't have any need to go near the DOM.</span> <span data-start="582.05" data-end="583.7">It just wants to tick, and pause,</span> <span data-start="583.7" data-end="584.51">and all those kinds of things.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="634.25" data-end="637.22">You send a message to this state machine, it's being ingested,</span> <span data-start="637.22" data-end="638.93">and then a transition happens.</span> </p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="640.534" data-end="642.2"><span class="speaker">Surma</span>: So we found, actually, that there</span> <span data-start="642.2" data-end="644.48">are a lot of implementations for state machines</span> <span data-start="644.48" data-end="646.85">out there in the wild, and that's not very unexpected.</span> <span data-start="646.85" data-end="648.59">And we have kind of been using xstate,</span> <span data-start="648.59" data-end="650.502">which is written by David from Microsoft,</span> <span data-start="650.502" data-end="651.71">and it's working really well.</span> <span data-start="651.71" data-end="654.364">It allows you to declare your state machine as a JSON object.</span> <span data-start="654.364" data-end="656.03">So you just declare your states and then</span> <span data-start="656.03" data-end="657.38">what the transitions are.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="657.38" data-end="660.68">And then you just pass this to this machine constructor,</span> <span data-start="660.68" data-end="661.94">and you get a state machine.</span> </p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="661.94" data-end="665.87"><span class="speaker">Paul Lewis</span>: So our clock extends the Actor base class,</span> <span data-start="665.87" data-end="668.157">and what we do is we instantiate our state Machine.</span> <span data-start="668.157" data-end="669.74">We say, go to the initial state, which</span> <span data-start="669.74" data-end="672.54">happens to that paused state.</span> <span data-start="672.54" data-end="676.35">And then later on, imagine that we receive a message.</span> <span data-start="676.35" data-end="678.96">And our Actor base class has this onMessage callback,</span> <span data-start="678.96" data-end="680.46">which is, I got a message.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="680.46" data-end="682.287">What do I do?</span> <span data-start="682.287" data-end="684.12">In this case, we would assume that the state</span> <span data-start="684.12" data-end="686.25">would be changing inside of our state machine.</span> <span data-start="686.25" data-end="688.44">So we use the state machine transition</span> <span data-start="688.44" data-end="691.07">to get from wherever it was to wherever it needs to be.</span> <span data-start="691.07" data-end="694.554">So the message is basically driving the clock.</span> <span data-start="694.554" data-end="696.47">And we'll inspect what the new state value is.</span> <span data-start="696.47" data-end="698.34">So if we find that our clock is running,</span> <span data-start="698.34" data-end="702">we'll set a tick time out for one second.</span> <span data-start="702" data-end="704.22">If we tick, we increment our tick count.</span> <span data-start="704.22" data-end="707.71">And then the clock will send itself a message.</span> <span data-start="707.71" data-end="710.04">Now, it could call its own functions.</span> <span data-start="710.04" data-end="712.68">But we tend to be a little bit — </span> <span data-start="712.68" data-end="713.857">we like it fair.</span> <span data-start="713.857" data-end="716.19">And so what we do is we make sure the clock sends itself</span> <span data-start="716.19" data-end="717.773">a message like every other actor would</span> <span data-start="717.773" data-end="719.03">have to send it a message.</span> </p>
<p></p></section>

<p></p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="970.12" data-end="972.55"><span class="speaker">Surma</span>: So basically, if you want to do that, just measure</span> <span data-start="972.55" data-end="973.6">and see what the impact is.</span> </p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="973.6" data-end="974.433"><span class="speaker">Paul Lewis</span>: Exactly.</span> <span data-start="974.433" data-end="977.95">So the location independence —  for all that notwithstanding,</span> <span data-start="977.95" data-end="979.72">imagine we were back here where we</span> <span data-start="979.72" data-end="982.492">started with our four actors.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="982.492" data-end="984.7">And they're all on the main thread, which is probably</span> <span data-start="984.7" data-end="987.73">where we put them by default. We're sort of saying,</span> <span data-start="987.73" data-end="990.36">you might want to look at it more like this.</span> <span data-start="990.36" data-end="993.97">And you might be thinking, why do they say, not main thread?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="993.97" data-end="996.67">Surely, they just meant Web Workers.</span> <span data-start="996.67" data-end="1000.57">And we kind of did because, in most cases, when</span> <span data-start="1000.57" data-end="1002.91">we build these apps, web workers do feature heavily.</span> <span data-start="1002.91" data-end="1006.42">We do move quite a lot of our actors to web workers,</span> <span data-start="1006.42" data-end="1008.94">especially if they're non-chatty.</span> </p>

<section><p><span data-start="1008.94" data-end="1011.28"><span class="speaker">Surma</span>: But not quite.</span> <span data-start="1011.28" data-end="1013.14">So we actually think, or have tried,</span> <span data-start="1013.14" data-end="1015.75">that it's sometimes very, very useful to run an actor,</span> <span data-start="1015.75" data-end="1017.785">for example, on the server side.</span> <span data-start="1017.785" data-end="1019.41">And this is kind of an interesting jump</span> <span data-start="1019.41" data-end="1022.59">to make because it allows you to incorporate</span> <span data-start="1022.59" data-end="1024.3">your back end into the architecture</span> <span data-start="1024.3" data-end="1025.8">of your entire app.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1025.8" data-end="1027.724">It is just another actor in the system.</span> <span data-start="1027.724" data-end="1029.099">And as a matter of fact, the game</span> <span data-start="1029.099" data-end="1030.29">that you've been playing all day — </span> <span data-start="1030.29" data-end="1031.68">and it totally had no bugs at all</span> <span data-start="1031.68" data-end="1034.65">whatsoever —  is actually written in this model.</span> <span data-start="1034.65" data-end="1037.079">So every player that is playing is an actor.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1037.079" data-end="1041.26">The admin panel that the MCs use to control the app is an actor.</span> <span data-start="1041.26" data-end="1043.569">The presentation view —  just another actor.</span> <span data-start="1043.569" data-end="1045.18">And then the Firebase Storage — </span> <span data-start="1045.18" data-end="1047.367">a shared actor that's running on the server side.</span> </p>

<section><p><span data-start="1047.367" data-end="1049.2"><span class="speaker">Paul Lewis</span>: Now interestingly, the mechanism</span> <span data-start="1049.2" data-end="1051.834">by which they chat using the hookup and lookup</span> <span data-start="1051.834" data-end="1052.5">can be anything.</span> <span data-start="1052.5" data-end="1053.249">It could be Fetch.</span> <span data-start="1053.249" data-end="1054.47">It could be a WebSocket.</span> <span data-start="1054.47" data-end="1055.83">And it really doesn't matter.</span> </p></section>

<p><span data-start="1057.468" data-end="1059.25">So long as talk, these actors can talk,</span> <span data-start="1059.25" data-end="1062.1">and they've got a way of sending messages to one another,</span> <span data-start="1062.1" data-end="1063.31">you're all set.</span> <span data-start="1063.31" data-end="1066.15">So back to our original question.</span> <span data-start="1066.15" data-end="1068.67">Did we actually help with rush hour?</span> <span data-start="1068.67" data-end="1070.35">Would this actually help?</span> <span data-start="1070.35" data-end="1071.347">Well, let's review.</span> </p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="1071.347" data-end="1072.93"><span class="speaker">Surma</span>: So one thing that we definitely</span> <span data-start="1072.93" data-end="1076.92">did achieve is that we are making it less likely to have</span> <span data-start="1076.92" data-end="1080.22">big chunks of uninterruptable JavaScript and more</span> <span data-start="1080.22" data-end="1082.92">little chunks where the browser can stop it in between</span> <span data-start="1082.92" data-end="1083.98">and ship a frame.</span> <span data-start="1083.98" data-end="1086.28">So that's definitely one advantage that we have.</span> </p>

<section><p><span data-start="1097.86" data-end="1099.93"><span class="speaker">Surma</span>: And as a result, a lot of work</span> <span data-start="1099.93" data-end="1101.67">that can happen in an unexpected way,</span> <span data-start="1101.67" data-end="1104.55">if you're processing a big API response to something,</span> <span data-start="1104.55" data-end="1107.13">that can happen in the worker and not affect your main thread</span> <span data-start="1107.13" data-end="1109.382">from going into jank mode.</span> </p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="1109.382" data-end="1111.09"><span class="speaker">Paul Lewis</span>: There are some other benefits</span> <span data-start="1111.09" data-end="1113.926">that Surma, Tim, and I have noticed as well working</span> <span data-start="1113.926" data-end="1115.05">in this particular pattern.</span> <span data-start="1115.05" data-end="1117.54">One is better testing.</span> <span data-start="1117.54" data-end="1122.28">With that kind of area of ownership,</span> <span data-start="1122.28" data-end="1124.722">it's easier to look at an actor and go,</span> <span data-start="1124.722" data-end="1126.18">oh, well I know what you should do.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1126.18" data-end="1128.489">And you've got an onMessage that I can call,</span> <span data-start="1128.489" data-end="1130.53">and I can make sure that you do the right things.</span> <span data-start="1130.53" data-end="1132.76">So the testing seems to become a little bit easier.</span> </p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="1274.66" data-end="1277.75"><span class="speaker">Paul Lewis</span>: So that was the rush hour bit.</span> <span data-start="1277.75" data-end="1281.177">That future-facing stuff like the VR, AR, and so on — </span> <span data-start="1281.177" data-end="1282.76">well, we have some thoughts there too.</span> <span data-start="1282.76" data-end="1283.554">Watch this.</span> <span data-start="1283.554" data-end="1285.22">So you were talking about actors before.</span> <span data-start="1285.22" data-end="1287.08">And I want to talk about cameras.</span> <span data-start="1287.08" data-end="1288.37">And the reason I want to talk about cameras</span> <span data-start="1288.37" data-end="1290.33">is because it all plays into that story, right?</span> <span data-start="1290.33" data-end="1292.538">So if can, have one of these lenses before I drop it,</span> <span data-start="1292.538" data-end="1294.7">because I don't want to.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1294.7" data-end="1297.46">Your modern camera has two bits — </span> <span data-start="1297.46" data-end="1300.04">the camera body, which is the thing that</span> <span data-start="1300.04" data-end="1302.28">holds the state when you're shooting in JPEG or RAW — </span> </p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="1302.28" data-end="1302.44"><span class="speaker">Surma</span>: Yeah.</span> <span data-start="1302.44" data-end="1303.33">It's like the business logic.</span> <span data-start="1303.33" data-end="1305.2">It knows how to take the picture and how to store it</span> <span data-start="1305.2" data-end="1306.08">and it does all that.</span> </p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="1306.08" data-end="1306.58"><span class="speaker">Paul Lewis</span>: Yeah.</span> <span data-start="1306.58" data-end="1308.53">Whether you're shooting video, or taking photos with it,</span> <span data-start="1308.53" data-end="1310.22">or whether you are autofocus or manual</span> <span data-start="1310.22" data-end="1311.29">focus —  you get the idea.</span> <span data-start="1311.29" data-end="1313.66">Similar to like a web app, that's</span> <span data-start="1313.66" data-end="1314.92">the state of what's going on.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1314.92" data-end="1318.11">But you've got different lenses for different tasks.</span> <span data-start="1318.11" data-end="1321.1">So that one would be something like a portrait lens.</span> <span data-start="1321.1" data-end="1323.11">This one might be a wide-angle — </span> <span data-start="1323.11" data-end="1324.647">take something of a landscape.</span> </p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="1324.647" data-end="1327.23"><span class="speaker">Surma</span>: As long as we make sure that the mounts are compatible,</span> <span data-start="1327.23" data-end="1328.73">which I guess, in actor world, means</span> <span data-start="1328.73" data-end="1330.994">that they speak with the same messages to each other.</span> </p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="1330.994" data-end="1331.66"><span class="speaker">Paul Lewis</span>: Yes.</span> <span data-start="1331.66" data-end="1334.12">So the messages that they send are really important.</span> <span data-start="1334.12" data-end="1336.7">They're standardized, right?</span> <span data-start="1336.7" data-end="1339.17">And everybody kind of plays to that same data contract.</span> <span data-start="1339.17" data-end="1341.08">Other than that, you can do what you like.</span> </p>

<section><p><span data-start="1343.442" data-end="1344.65"><span class="speaker">Surma</span>: Last video, I promise.</span> </p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="1344.65" data-end="1345.358"><span class="speaker">Paul Lewis</span>: Yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1345.358" data-end="1347.39">So camera lenses —  why camera lenses?</span> <span data-start="1347.39" data-end="1351.08">How does that apply to this story?</span> <span data-start="1351.08" data-end="1352.77">When we talked about this earlier,</span> <span data-start="1352.77" data-end="1355.667">I think very naturally, we would have all thought of the DOM.</span> <span data-start="1355.667" data-end="1357.5">We would have thought of, in the chess game,</span> <span data-start="1357.5" data-end="1360.35">we would have thought of this version.</span> <span data-start="1360.35" data-end="1363.369">But there's the freedom that you get from a UI actor</span> <span data-start="1363.369" data-end="1365.41">that, as long as it can speak the right messages,</span> <span data-start="1365.41" data-end="1367.76">it can be implemented in different technologies.</span> <span data-start="1367.76" data-end="1371.77">So you could have a different actor that does 3D.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1371.77" data-end="1372.79">And now you get that.</span> <span data-start="1372.79" data-end="1376.09">It just has to send the same messages as the standard DOM</span> <span data-start="1376.09" data-end="1376.96">version.</span> <span data-start="1376.96" data-end="1380.17">Or maybe one full XR, similarly, it</span> <span data-start="1380.17" data-end="1381.6">needs to be able to do that — </span> <span data-start="1381.6" data-end="1382.84">send the right messages.</span> <span data-start="1382.84" data-end="1385.93">And perhaps something like Voice as well — </span> <span data-start="1385.93" data-end="1387.479">similar kind of story.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1387.479" data-end="1389.02">So as a byproduct of the actor model,</span> <span data-start="1389.02" data-end="1392.71">we've all of a sudden got these different swappable UI</span> <span data-start="1392.71" data-end="1395.002">actors that we can take with us wherever we need to go.</span> <span data-start="1395.002" data-end="1396.418">And you might say, well, actually,</span> <span data-start="1396.418" data-end="1398.83">all I need in this particular app is the XR and Voice.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1398.83" data-end="1401.442">Or maybe I want DOM and Voice.</span> </p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="1401.442" data-end="1403.15"><span class="speaker">Surma</span>: And you could even imagine a setup</span> <span data-start="1403.15" data-end="1406.84">where you have a DOM actor with lots of effects and visuals</span> <span data-start="1406.84" data-end="1410.41">and one DOM actor implements the same app, but with a much</span> <span data-start="1410.41" data-end="1414.25">less intense memory consumption version, like a low-end version</span> <span data-start="1414.25" data-end="1415.15">of your website.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1415.15" data-end="1417.52">And once you detect that the device we're running on</span> <span data-start="1417.52" data-end="1419.317">is actually kind of struggling to keep up.</span> <span data-start="1419.317" data-end="1421.15">You can actually switch it out in the middle</span> <span data-start="1421.15" data-end="1424.097">of the app and downgrade to the lower visual version.</span> </p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="1424.097" data-end="1426.43"><span class="speaker">Paul Lewis</span>: Or one would say reduced motion or something</span> <span data-start="1426.43" data-end="1427.6">like that.</span> <span data-start="1427.6" data-end="1429.1">And technically, this will be called</span> <span data-start="1429.1" data-end="1430.75">multi-view or multi-modal, which is</span> <span data-start="1430.75" data-end="1432.791">a very fancy way of saying there are lots of ways</span> <span data-start="1432.791" data-end="1434.14">to interact with your web app.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1434.14" data-end="1436.92">And as a byproduct, within the actor model,</span> <span data-start="1436.92" data-end="1439.311">it enables you to do that pretty well.</span> <span data-start="1439.311" data-end="1441.31">So if you're interested in looking at the hookup</span> <span data-start="1441.31" data-end="1442.799">and lookup of the Actor base class</span> <span data-start="1442.799" data-end="1444.34">that we mentioned earlier, this would</span> <span data-start="1444.34" data-end="1447.17">be the place to go if you want to take a snap at that.</span> </p>
<p></p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="1447.17" data-end="1449.53"><span class="speaker">Surma</span>: This is actually, not only the Actor base class,</span> <span data-start="1449.53" data-end="1450.952">but it's actually a boiler plate.</span> <span data-start="1450.952" data-end="1451.91">So it gets you started.</span> <span data-start="1451.91" data-end="1454.16">There's rollup configured where you can just build it,</span> <span data-start="1454.16" data-end="1455.952">does the code splitting, the lazy loading.</span> <span data-start="1455.952" data-end="1457.66">It should get you started really quickly,</span> <span data-start="1457.66" data-end="1459.37">so you can start writing actors and get</span> <span data-start="1459.37" data-end="1460.615">a feel for how it feels.</span> </p>
<p></p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="1460.615" data-end="1461.74"><span class="speaker">Paul Lewis</span>: Let's be clear.</span> <span data-start="1461.74" data-end="1462.4">It's experimental.</span> <span data-start="1462.4" data-end="1464.066">It's just the stomping ground that we've</span> <span data-start="1464.066" data-end="1465.89">been using for the last little while.</span> <span data-start="1465.89" data-end="1468.223">And we'd love you to take a look and have a chat with us</span> <span data-start="1468.223" data-end="1470.364">and just tell us what you think.</span> <span data-start="1470.364" data-end="1472.78">So in summary, we're actually quite excited that something</span> <span data-start="1472.78" data-end="1476.08">from 45 years ago has kind of come full circle,</span> <span data-start="1476.08" data-end="1479.516">and it seems to be the thing — </span> </p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="1479.516" data-end="1481.14"><span class="speaker">Surma</span>: It's been hiding in plain sight.</span> </p></section>

<section><p><span data-start="1481.14" data-end="1481.848"><span class="speaker">Paul Lewis</span>: Yeah.</span> <span data-start="1481.848" data-end="1483.975">And from some of the places in computing,</span> <span data-start="1483.975" data-end="1486.1">we've kind of brought it over, not in a purist way.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1486.1" data-end="1488.154">We have our own take on these things.</span> <span data-start="1488.154" data-end="1489.82">But it respects that single-threadedness</span> <span data-start="1489.82" data-end="1491.02">of JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="1491.02" data-end="1492.97">It seems to help with rush hour.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1492.97" data-end="1495.46">And it also seems to enable us to go multi-modal, which</span> <span data-start="1495.46" data-end="1497.11">is really kind of exciting.</span> <span data-start="1497.11" data-end="1499.446">And on that note, thanks.</span> </p></section>
