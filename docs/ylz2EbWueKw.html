<p><span data-start="6.552" data-end="8.01"><span class="speaker">Chris Wilson</span>: So I am Chris Wilson.</span> <span data-start="8.01" data-end="9.718">I'm here with my colleague, John Pallett,</span> <span data-start="9.718" data-end="11.17">who will be out in a minute.</span> <span data-start="11.17" data-end="13.98">And we're here to talk about the next great platform,</span> <span data-start="13.98" data-end="16.079">the Immersive Web.</span> <span data-start="16.079" data-end="18.45">And this is actually not running off my laptop,</span> <span data-start="18.45" data-end="20.16">so hopefully I won't have any problems.</span> <span data-start="20.16" data-end="22.7">At least they won't be mine.</span> <span data-start="22.7" data-end="27.45">Now we talk about this word immersive a lot,</span> <span data-start="27.45" data-end="30.84">and I want to define what I meant by the immersive web.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="30.84" data-end="33.36">And at this point, I think pretty much everyone has heard</span> <span data-start="33.36" data-end="35.1">of virtual reality at least.</span> <span data-start="35.1" data-end="37.892">Hands up, who saw "Ready Player One "?</span> <span data-start="37.892" data-end="39.706">That's actually a really small percentage.</span> <span data-start="39.706" data-end="40.58">You should go see it.</span> <span data-start="40.58" data-end="41.329">It's a good movie.</span> <span data-start="41.329" data-end="42.35">It's good entertainment.</span> <span data-start="42.35" data-end="44.39">So it's totally just like that.</span> <span data-start="44.39" data-end="46.52">Well, not really, but virtual reality</span> <span data-start="46.52" data-end="49.49">is all about immersing yourself in a completely alternate</span> <span data-start="49.49" data-end="53.21">reality, putting what I refer to as the reality blinders on,</span> <span data-start="53.21" data-end="57.68">completely replacing everything you can see and usually here,</span> <span data-start="57.68" data-end="60.98">and immersing yourself in this totally different world.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="60.98" data-end="62.7">That world may be a game.</span> <span data-start="62.7" data-end="66.03">It can be like visualizing a data set.</span> <span data-start="66.03" data-end="68.12">It can be a virtual workspace.</span> <span data-start="68.12" data-end="71.695">My kids like to play this game where I put on a VR headset</span> <span data-start="71.695" data-end="73.07">and they see how close to me they</span> <span data-start="73.07" data-end="76.55">can dance before I notice that they're there, which usually</span> <span data-start="76.55" data-end="77.609">it's pretty close.</span> <span data-start="77.609" data-end="79.4">But certainly, when I'm at my desk at work,</span> <span data-start="79.4" data-end="82.31">this is my favorite place to go into VR, because it</span> <span data-start="82.31" data-end="84.17">masks everything off around me.</span> <span data-start="84.17" data-end="87.59">The sea of cubicles isn't there anymore.</span> <span data-start="87.59" data-end="90.44">And you usually experience virtual reality</span> <span data-start="90.44" data-end="94.37">through a tethered VR headset, like a Vive or Rift,</span> <span data-start="94.37" data-end="97.07">standalone devices like the Oculus Go,</span> <span data-start="97.07" data-end="101.48">or smartphone VR systems, like Daydream View, Gear VR,</span> <span data-start="101.48" data-end="103.94">or Google Cardboard, my personal favorite.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="103.94" data-end="106.49">And any of these devices end up using a combination</span> <span data-start="106.49" data-end="109.7">of head tracking, screen display, optics,</span> <span data-start="109.7" data-end="112.22">and controllers to make you feel like you're</span> <span data-start="112.22" data-end="114.74">present in a totally different world.</span> <span data-start="114.74" data-end="116.39">Now, at Google, we've been working</span> <span data-start="116.39" data-end="121.58">on exposing this to the web for really quite a long time on all</span> <span data-start="121.58" data-end="124.82">these devices, from high end desktop headsets</span> <span data-start="124.82" data-end="128.449">on Windows to a polyfill that supports WebVR</span> <span data-start="128.449" data-end="131">on any smartphone in Cardboard.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="131" data-end="134.21">Yes, even Safari on iPhones.</span> <span data-start="134.21" data-end="136.73">And, in fact, you may not even have a VR headset.</span> <span data-start="136.73" data-end="141.15">You might not even have this $0.29 worth of cardboard.</span> <span data-start="141.15" data-end="145.55">WebXR and the XR polyfill can actually view VR worlds just</span> <span data-start="145.55" data-end="149.06">on a mobile device using the accelerometer and orientation</span> <span data-start="149.06" data-end="149.96">API.</span> <span data-start="149.96" data-end="152.15">So you can look around a 3D scene.</span> <span data-start="152.15" data-end="154.67">And this lets the users look around your 3D world</span> <span data-start="154.67" data-end="159.61">even if they don't want to drop their phone into a headset.</span> <span data-start="159.61" data-end="164.43">Now, in addition to bringing VR to the web, we also — </span> <span data-start="164.43" data-end="167.64">my team actually works on bringing the web into VR,</span> <span data-start="167.64" data-end="169.29">at least on Daydream devices.</span> <span data-start="169.29" data-end="171.72">Starting with Chrome 67, you can actually</span> <span data-start="171.72" data-end="175.5">launch a VR version of Chrome inside the Daydream home</span> <span data-start="175.5" data-end="177.72">screen, and we put a lot of work into making</span> <span data-start="177.72" data-end="182.11">browsing the traditional 2D web a really great experience.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="182.11" data-end="187.05">But, of course, the really cool part is when the browser in VR</span> <span data-start="187.05" data-end="189.51">can be used to browse immersive worlds.</span> <span data-start="189.51" data-end="192.84">You can hop back and forth between the 2D web and VR</span> <span data-start="192.84" data-end="196.9">content that's hosted directly on the web.</span> <span data-start="196.9" data-end="200.31">So this gives you a really great easy experience</span> <span data-start="200.31" data-end="202.47">and really, actually, totally immersive.</span> <span data-start="202.47" data-end="207.42">It's like you're just navigating inside that world.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="207.42" data-end="212.22">Now, having a browser inside the VR world is so useful.</span> <span data-start="212.22" data-end="215.43">It turns out 83% of Daydream users</span> <span data-start="215.43" data-end="218.31">also regularly use the browser in VR.</span> <span data-start="218.31" data-end="220.62">This was something we added on after the fact.</span> <span data-start="220.62" data-end="222.97">Daydream shipped without a browser.</span> <span data-start="222.97" data-end="226.65">And now this is a regular occurrence for most of them.</span> <span data-start="226.65" data-end="228.96">It shows how important the content from the web</span> <span data-start="228.96" data-end="233.864">is, even when you're just living inside a VR world.</span> <span data-start="233.864" data-end="235.78">But enough about virtual reality for a second.</span> <span data-start="235.78" data-end="239.56">I want to talk about when you don't want those reality</span> <span data-start="239.56" data-end="240.432">blinders on.</span> <span data-start="240.432" data-end="242.14">I actually like to interact with my kids.</span> <span data-start="242.14" data-end="243.681">I want to be able to see them and not</span> <span data-start="243.681" data-end="245.41">have them dance in front of me.</span> <span data-start="245.41" data-end="248.53">And the most exciting extension of the computing platform,</span> <span data-start="248.53" data-end="251.77">to me, is the concept of augmented reality,</span> <span data-start="251.77" data-end="256.269">not just overlaying AR stickers and animated characters</span> <span data-start="256.269" data-end="259.7">or being able to drop virtual objects into your reality.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="259.7" data-end="262.029">The key to understanding AR's potential</span> <span data-start="262.029" data-end="265.72">is that it's really about the concept of your computer</span> <span data-start="265.72" data-end="268.84">getting to see, getting to see a world around you,</span> <span data-start="268.84" data-end="271.96">interpret parts of it, find surfaces, in the future,</span> <span data-start="271.96" data-end="274.6">recognize objects, and then augment</span> <span data-start="274.6" data-end="278.65">that reality with virtual bits of user experience.</span> <span data-start="278.65" data-end="281.47">Instead of trying to totally replace your reality,</span> <span data-start="281.47" data-end="284.5">we really want computers to just convincingly blend</span> <span data-start="284.5" data-end="288.64">virtual and real experiences.</span> <span data-start="288.64" data-end="290.35">Now, for AR, there are some headsets,</span> <span data-start="290.35" data-end="292.7">like the Hololens, the Magic Leap One.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="292.7" data-end="299.14">There are projection systems to display on real-world surfaces.</span> <span data-start="299.14" data-end="301.99">But most users will probably first experience AR</span> <span data-start="301.99" data-end="304.06">like I did, using a camera passthrough</span> <span data-start="304.06" data-end="306.37">experience on a mobile device showing things</span> <span data-start="306.37" data-end="309.01">like AR stickers.</span> <span data-start="309.01" data-end="311.26">And the cool thing is, if you think of the things</span> <span data-start="311.26" data-end="316.21">the web is really, really good at, the long tail of software,</span> <span data-start="316.21" data-end="320.32">content, products you expect from the web, the experiences</span> <span data-start="320.32" data-end="323.44">that users will probably happily click</span> <span data-start="323.44" data-end="325.75">on but they wouldn't necessarily install</span> <span data-start="325.75" data-end="328.48">on their devices, the massive success of the web</span> <span data-start="328.48" data-end="332.11">as a commerce platform is a huge, huge benefit.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="332.11" data-end="334.69">You can start to see how enabling developers</span> <span data-start="334.69" data-end="336.4">to build immersive experiences that</span> <span data-start="336.4" data-end="339.28">are delivered in this really ephemeral fashion</span> <span data-start="339.28" data-end="341.96">is a fantastic idea.</span> <span data-start="341.96" data-end="344.62">You don't have to install an app to see how that couch is going</span> <span data-start="344.62" data-end="345.82">to look in your living room.</span> <span data-start="345.82" data-end="349.09">You don't have to install an app to view an immersive video</span> <span data-start="349.09" data-end="350.33">trailer.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="350.33" data-end="352.63">The ephemerality of the web makes the ability</span> <span data-start="352.63" data-end="355.98">to do these immersive experiences a fantastic match.</span> <span data-start="355.98" data-end="358">And our mission, John's and mine,</span> <span data-start="358" data-end="361.18">is really to enable web developers to break that plane,</span> <span data-start="361.18" data-end="363.43">break out of the flat design world</span> <span data-start="363.43" data-end="365.14">that we've been living in for so long</span> <span data-start="365.14" data-end="369.42">to enable these truly immersive experiences.</span> <span data-start="369.42" data-end="371.37">And to enable that, we really needed</span> <span data-start="371.37" data-end="374.14">to start with the baseline, being</span> <span data-start="374.14" data-end="378.1">able to connect immersive displays and render to them.</span> <span data-start="378.1" data-end="381.52">And that's where the WebXR device API comes in.</span> <span data-start="381.52" data-end="384.16">This replaces the old WebVR API.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="384.16" data-end="388.84">It evolves those concepts to expose not just VR but also AR</span> <span data-start="388.84" data-end="392.2">functionality, and in true, extensible web platform</span> <span data-start="392.2" data-end="392.96">layering.</span> <span data-start="392.96" data-end="395.02">This is really the underpinning only.</span> <span data-start="395.02" data-end="398.65">This lets us connect to those devices, render displays,</span> <span data-start="398.65" data-end="401.62">understand which way they're pointed,</span> <span data-start="401.62" data-end="404.39">interact with controllers, that kind of stuff.</span> <span data-start="404.39" data-end="408.55">And this is a really broad multi-year effort</span> <span data-start="408.55" data-end="410.5">by a bunch of different companies.</span> <span data-start="410.5" data-end="414.43">Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, Samsung, Amazon, Oculus,</span> <span data-start="414.43" data-end="416.32">a whole bunch of others as well have been</span> <span data-start="416.32" data-end="419.8">working on this for a while.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="419.8" data-end="423.28">And this has all been developed, by the way, in the W3C.</span> <span data-start="423.28" data-end="426.52">In fact, we have a brand new immersive web working group.</span> <span data-start="426.52" data-end="429.79">I personally co-chair this with my colleague, Ada Rose Cannon,</span> <span data-start="429.79" data-end="432.43">who's sitting right down here in the front — </span> <span data-start="432.43" data-end="434.83">I just had to make her blush — </span> <span data-start="434.83" data-end="435.83">from Samsung.</span> <span data-start="435.83" data-end="438.52">And we're tasked with taking this spec</span> <span data-start="438.52" data-end="440.53">to an actual final status.</span> <span data-start="440.53" data-end="442.96">And this is why we created a working group,</span> <span data-start="442.96" data-end="445.84">because we feel it's super important to actually land this</span> <span data-start="445.84" data-end="448.21">now and not just keep talking about how</span> <span data-start="448.21" data-end="450.34">cool it could be in the future.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="450.34" data-end="453.13">This really shows the maturing of this API,</span> <span data-start="453.13" data-end="455.05">because it's moving closer and closer</span> <span data-start="455.05" data-end="456.73">to becoming a final standard.</span> <span data-start="456.73" data-end="459.76">And, of course, we also continue to incubate new ideas</span> <span data-start="459.76" data-end="463.46">in the immersive web with the community group.</span> <span data-start="463.46" data-end="466.72">Now, if you want to experiment with WebXR API today,</span> <span data-start="466.72" data-end="470.35">you can enable it with Chrome's flags, with the about flags.</span> <span data-start="470.35" data-end="472.21">If you want to try out AR scenarios,</span> <span data-start="472.21" data-end="473.965">you have to enable this second flag.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="473.965" data-end="475.84">That should be going away soon, because we've</span> <span data-start="475.84" data-end="479.23">done some new mode work in the spec to make that work, too.</span> <span data-start="479.23" data-end="482.23">We have a currently running origin trial, too,</span> <span data-start="482.23" data-end="486.07">if you want to try to deploy this out to normal users,</span> <span data-start="486.07" data-end="488.92">and, of course, if you're willing to accept</span> <span data-start="488.92" data-end="491.2">the responsibility of making changes</span> <span data-start="491.2" data-end="493">as the spec and our implementation change.</span> <span data-start="495.52" data-end="498.07">Now, finally, I've mentioned the WebXR polyfill</span> <span data-start="498.07" data-end="498.82">a couple of times.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="498.82" data-end="500.403">And this is something I wanted to give</span> <span data-start="500.403" data-end="501.58">a little more detail about.</span> <span data-start="501.58" data-end="503.65">This is a polyfill JavaScript library</span> <span data-start="503.65" data-end="506.74">that's maintained by the community group.</span> <span data-start="506.74" data-end="509.09">It helps developers in a couple of different ways.</span> <span data-start="509.09" data-end="513.039">First, it offers a JavaScript-only implementation</span> <span data-start="513.039" data-end="517.39">that works for VR scenarios in any mobile browser using</span> <span data-start="517.39" data-end="518.83">orientation events.</span> <span data-start="518.83" data-end="522.13">So even mobile Safari, with cardboard devices</span> <span data-start="522.13" data-end="524.2">or flat displays, you can actually</span> <span data-start="524.2" data-end="528.61">get a WebXR implementation just through JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="528.61" data-end="531.76">Secondly, if a browser does implement the older WebVR</span> <span data-start="531.76" data-end="537.34">API, like Firefox did this and Microsoft Edge did this,</span> <span data-start="537.34" data-end="540.64">it can actually build XR on top of that.</span> <span data-start="540.64" data-end="544.72">And you get the hardware speed of their former WebVR</span> <span data-start="544.72" data-end="545.92">implementation.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="545.92" data-end="548.02">So you can instantly make your WebXR content</span> <span data-start="548.02" data-end="553.36">accessible to a much wider range of users with just one script.</span> <span data-start="553.36" data-end="557.03">Now, with that, I want to bring out my colleague, John,</span> <span data-start="557.03" data-end="559.51">who's going to drill down into the augmented reality</span> <span data-start="559.51" data-end="561.94">possibilities in a bit more detail.</span> <span data-start="561.94" data-end="562.62">Thanks, John.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="584.839" data-end="586.38">And the reason for this is that there</span> <span data-start="586.38" data-end="588.96">are hundreds of millions of phones and tablets</span> <span data-start="588.96" data-end="591.99">out there right now that support augmented reality,</span> <span data-start="591.99" data-end="593.59">and the number is growing.</span> <span data-start="593.59" data-end="595.81">And most of those devices have web browsers,</span> <span data-start="595.81" data-end="598.23">which means there is a big opportunity for web developers</span> <span data-start="598.23" data-end="598.86">here.</span> <span data-start="598.86" data-end="600.69">And the lowest hanging fruit, really,</span> <span data-start="600.69" data-end="604.71">is the ability to add a new experience to an existing 2D</span> <span data-start="604.71" data-end="605.52">web page.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="605.52" data-end="607.5">So it doesn't require an entirely new site.</span> <span data-start="607.5" data-end="611.694">You can add AR capability to an existing 2D website.</span> <span data-start="611.694" data-end="613.11">There've been a number of partners</span> <span data-start="613.11" data-end="615.39">that have been experimenting with this using the WebXR</span> <span data-start="615.39" data-end="618.09">device API and turning on the hit test flag</span> <span data-start="618.09" data-end="619.5">that Chris mentioned.</span> <span data-start="619.5" data-end="622.02">They're doing this in Chrome Dev and in Canary.</span> <span data-start="622.02" data-end="625.11">And as one example, Plattar, which is an augmented reality</span> <span data-start="625.11" data-end="627.18">platform that lets businesses put</span> <span data-start="627.18" data-end="629.369">virtual objects in the real world,</span> <span data-start="629.369" data-end="630.66">they've done a couple of demos.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="630.66" data-end="632.88">And there's some interesting ideas here.</span> <span data-start="632.88" data-end="638.07">On the left, you can see that users can learn about a product</span> <span data-start="638.07" data-end="642.09">by getting information in context on the product itself</span> <span data-start="642.09" data-end="644.19">rather than having to go through data sheets.</span> <span data-start="644.19" data-end="646.08">And it actually saves shipping demo units</span> <span data-start="646.08" data-end="647.97">to businesses that are thinking about buying</span> <span data-start="647.97" data-end="649.98">machinery or heavy equipment.</span> <span data-start="649.98" data-end="651.714">On the right, you can see that looking</span> <span data-start="651.714" data-end="653.88">at objects from different angles has a lot of value,</span> <span data-start="653.88" data-end="656.46">in this case, for fashion, and generally,</span> <span data-start="656.46" data-end="659.58">for shopping, but also for education where students</span> <span data-start="659.58" data-end="661.8">can explore the object or artifact</span> <span data-start="661.8" data-end="663.6">that they're learning about.</span> <span data-start="663.6" data-end="666.18">Now, this doesn't all have to be in augmented reality.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="666.18" data-end="669.18">You could do both of these using a 3D model on your website.</span> <span data-start="669.18" data-end="671.1">But if you can put it into the real world,</span> <span data-start="671.1" data-end="675.822">you get a better sense of context as well as scale.</span> <span data-start="675.822" data-end="677.28">Now, what's interesting, though, is</span> <span data-start="677.28" data-end="680.569">that, from a user experience perspective,</span> <span data-start="680.569" data-end="682.11">there are a lot of interesting things</span> <span data-start="682.11" data-end="684.67">to learn about augmented reality,</span> <span data-start="684.67" data-end="686.622">particularly how it fits on the web.</span> <span data-start="686.622" data-end="688.83">And it's a good reason to start experimenting with it</span> <span data-start="688.83" data-end="690.99">now if you're thinking about adding it.</span> <span data-start="690.99" data-end="694.14">So by way of example, West Elm, who</span> <span data-start="694.14" data-end="697.56">sells home decor and furniture, did some in-store testing.</span> <span data-start="697.56" data-end="700.35">And what they did was they went to one of their stores</span> <span data-start="700.35" data-end="702.54">and they picked four shoppers at random.</span> <span data-start="702.54" data-end="705.69">And they showed them a prototype shopping website that</span> <span data-start="705.69" data-end="707.61">incorporated augmented reality.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="707.61" data-end="708.87">Now this isn't a huge study.</span> <span data-start="708.87" data-end="709.676">It's four shoppers.</span> <span data-start="709.676" data-end="711.3">But they had some interesting findings.</span> <span data-start="711.3" data-end="713.76">And they gave us permission to share them.</span> <span data-start="713.76" data-end="715.26">So the first thing that they learned</span> <span data-start="715.26" data-end="719.14">is with these customers, the terms AR or augmented reality,</span> <span data-start="719.14" data-end="721.29">it's not really a common vocabulary.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="721.29" data-end="723.96">Basic terminology, like view in your room,</span> <span data-start="723.96" data-end="726.39">is a better way of telling users what to do.</span> <span data-start="726.39" data-end="729.54">But even then, without a visual showing what's going to happen,</span> <span data-start="729.54" data-end="732.1">that text can really get lost with everything else that</span> <span data-start="732.1" data-end="733.83">is visual on the site.</span> <span data-start="733.83" data-end="735.3">So what they're looking at now is</span> <span data-start="735.3" data-end="738.222">ways to add both an icon and text so that the user has</span> <span data-start="738.222" data-end="738.93">a call to action.</span> <span data-start="738.93" data-end="740.4">They know what to do.</span> <span data-start="740.4" data-end="742.224">One approach might be to have a rotating 3D</span> <span data-start="742.224" data-end="743.89">model so that the user understands, hey,</span> <span data-start="743.89" data-end="747.07">this is more than just another image on the page.</span> <span data-start="747.07" data-end="749.32">The next thing they learned is that users get confused</span> <span data-start="749.32" data-end="750.43">without clear directions.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="750.43" data-end="753.82">You can see here that there's a delay while the user is trying</span> <span data-start="753.82" data-end="755.6">to figure out what to do.</span> <span data-start="755.6" data-end="756.22">Do I tap?</span> <span data-start="756.22" data-end="758.26">Do I move my phone around?</span> <span data-start="758.26" data-end="760">What is this circle on the floor?</span> <span data-start="760" data-end="761.92">I've never seen this before.</span> <span data-start="761.92" data-end="765.19">You have to actually guide users to the path of success here.</span> <span data-start="765.19" data-end="768.13">And West Elm is researching clear directions as well</span> <span data-start="768.13" data-end="770.597">as things like progress bars and loading indicators</span> <span data-start="770.597" data-end="772.18">so that users don't get lost, and they</span> <span data-start="772.18" data-end="774.388">can see how to get to the point that they're actually</span> <span data-start="774.388" data-end="778.97">placing furniture or an object into the real world.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="778.97" data-end="782.23">After that, once participants successfully placed an object,</span> <span data-start="782.23" data-end="784.43">the most common request was the ability</span> <span data-start="784.43" data-end="787.88">to move it or spin it or even remove it from the scene.</span> <span data-start="787.88" data-end="790.594">The original placement wasn't always where they wanted it to.</span> <span data-start="790.594" data-end="792.26">It wasn't always clear to users how they</span> <span data-start="792.26" data-end="794.42">could do that, in this case.</span> <span data-start="794.42" data-end="798.05">Another thing that they heard from their test subjects</span> <span data-start="798.05" data-end="800.57">as well was that getting validation,</span> <span data-start="800.57" data-end="803.584">that the size of the virtual object matched the real world,</span> <span data-start="803.584" data-end="804.5">would also be helpful.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="804.5" data-end="805.76">Because if you're shopping for furniture,</span> <span data-start="805.76" data-end="807.801">you want to make sure that it fits into the space</span> <span data-start="807.801" data-end="808.53">that you have.</span> <span data-start="808.53" data-end="809.905">So from that perspective, showing</span> <span data-start="809.905" data-end="813.92">some real-world dimensions with the model could help.</span> <span data-start="813.92" data-end="815.5">And finally, there was some feedback</span> <span data-start="815.5" data-end="817.27">on how real the assets looked.</span> <span data-start="817.27" data-end="819.43">And now this study was particularly unique</span> <span data-start="819.43" data-end="821.305">because West Elm was doing it in-store.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="821.305" data-end="823.93">And so they had the opportunity to put the virtual object right</span> <span data-start="823.93" data-end="827.71">next to the physical object and get real shopper feedback.</span> <span data-start="827.71" data-end="830.2">Generally speaking, the feedback on realism</span> <span data-start="830.2" data-end="831.947">here was only about 6 out of 10.</span> <span data-start="831.947" data-end="833.53">And you can see clearly that there are</span> <span data-start="833.53" data-end="835.25">differences between the two.</span> <span data-start="835.25" data-end="837.61">So West Elm is looking at how to handle typical lighting</span> <span data-start="837.61" data-end="839.56">scenarios and also make sure that the shadows</span> <span data-start="839.56" data-end="842.018">underneath the object are a little more pronounced and more</span> <span data-start="842.018" data-end="843.166">detailed.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="843.166" data-end="844.54">So the key message here really is</span> <span data-start="844.54" data-end="846.32">that there's a whole lot of things that you can learn.</span> <span data-start="846.32" data-end="848.29">There's a lot of streamlining going on here.</span> <span data-start="848.29" data-end="850.42">And fundamentally, augmented reality on the web</span> <span data-start="850.42" data-end="853.15">has some differences from apps where somebody might</span> <span data-start="853.15" data-end="855.13">be installing an augmented reality app,</span> <span data-start="855.13" data-end="859.21">and so they're discovering it in a completely different way.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="859.21" data-end="862">Despite those challenges, I think</span> <span data-start="862" data-end="864.31">a telling finding from this study</span> <span data-start="864.31" data-end="866.08">was that three of the four participants</span> <span data-start="866.08" data-end="869.86">said they would absolutely, 10 out of 10, use AR,</span> <span data-start="869.86" data-end="871.54">once they knew what that term meant,</span> <span data-start="871.54" data-end="874.03">to do furniture shopping.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="874.03" data-end="876.04">Now, if you're like me and you grew up</span> <span data-start="876.04" data-end="878.5">with commercials talking about three out of four dentists</span> <span data-start="878.5" data-end="880.15">recommend this toothpaste, you probably</span> <span data-start="880.15" data-end="882.76">all wondered, what does that fourth dentist think?</span> <span data-start="882.76" data-end="884.59">Does it rot teeth?</span> <span data-start="884.59" data-end="888.18">And the answer here is actually maybe.</span> <span data-start="888.18" data-end="889.56">So three people absolutely.</span> <span data-start="889.56" data-end="890.61">One person maybe.</span> <span data-start="890.61" data-end="892.697">I personally visualize that as these</span> <span data-start="892.697" data-end="894.78">are people shopping for home decor, and they said,</span> <span data-start="894.78" data-end="895.41">would you use this?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="895.41" data-end="896.43">And they're like maybe.</span> <span data-start="896.43" data-end="897.72">I'm here to buy a couch.</span> <span data-start="897.72" data-end="900.55">But I don't actually think that's how it went.</span> <span data-start="900.55" data-end="903.33">But the point here is that three people said absolutely.</span> <span data-start="903.33" data-end="905.7">Pulled from random, three people said absolutely.</span> <span data-start="905.7" data-end="906.631">It's a strong signal.</span> <span data-start="906.631" data-end="908.13">It's also consistent with what we've</span> <span data-start="908.13" data-end="910.26">heard from partners and users who</span> <span data-start="910.26" data-end="913.44">see value and be able to visualize 3D objects ideally</span> <span data-start="913.44" data-end="916.39">in the real world.</span> <span data-start="916.39" data-end="918.6">So if you're thinking about experimenting this</span> <span data-start="918.6" data-end="920.4">and you're thinking about adding this to your website,</span> <span data-start="920.4" data-end="922.83">let's talk a little bit about how you can build things.</span> <span data-start="922.83" data-end="925.11">Chris mentioned the flags you can enable a little bit earlier</span> <span data-start="925.11" data-end="927.526">in the presentation, but let's talk about how you actually</span> <span data-start="927.526" data-end="929.06">add the immersive experience.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="929.06" data-end="931.417">So you could write WebGL code directly.</span> <span data-start="931.417" data-end="933">And if you're doing augmented reality,</span> <span data-start="933" data-end="936.03">that would be over top of the camera feed.</span> <span data-start="936.03" data-end="937.41">That's one way you can do it.</span> <span data-start="937.41" data-end="940.2">Generally, we recommend using a library to help.</span> <span data-start="940.2" data-end="942.51">For example, three.js is a helper library</span> <span data-start="942.51" data-end="944.28">for 3D graphics on the web, and it</span> <span data-start="944.28" data-end="947.28">takes care of a lot of the heavy lifting for 3D geometry</span> <span data-start="947.28" data-end="948.42">management and rendering.</span> <span data-start="948.42" data-end="949.795">And it makes it so you don't have</span> <span data-start="949.795" data-end="951.73">to work with WebGL directly.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="951.73" data-end="954.327">So let's look at an example of how three and WebXR can</span> <span data-start="954.327" data-end="954.91">work together.</span> <span data-start="954.91" data-end="957.16">We're not going to cover the whole process of creating</span> <span data-start="957.16" data-end="958.72">a WebXR session and doing all that,</span> <span data-start="958.72" data-end="961.11">but we are going to look at how a virtual object can be</span> <span data-start="961.11" data-end="963.4">placed into a real-world scene.</span> <span data-start="963.4" data-end="965.49">And we're going to do that with a narrow use case,</span> <span data-start="965.49" data-end="968.785">in this case, putting a reticle onto a real world surface.</span> <span data-start="968.785" data-end="970.66">For those who haven't heard that term before,</span> <span data-start="970.66" data-end="972.09">a reticle is an indicator.</span> <span data-start="972.09" data-end="974.13">In this case, you can see it as it moves around.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="974.13" data-end="975.78">And it's typically a user interface</span> <span data-start="975.78" data-end="978.27">construct so that the user knows what they can do.</span> <span data-start="978.27" data-end="981.82">You saw some of this in the West Elm screenshots earlier.</span> <span data-start="981.82" data-end="984.27">So what we're going to do first in this case</span> <span data-start="984.27" data-end="986.85">is take the mesh for the reticle, which, in our case,</span> <span data-start="986.85" data-end="990.09">is a flat circle, and we'll add it to the three scene.</span> <span data-start="990.09" data-end="991.77">It's worth noting we'd like the reticle</span> <span data-start="991.77" data-end="993.63">to be about half a meter wide.</span> <span data-start="993.63" data-end="996.21">And so it's worth noting that the WebXR device</span> <span data-start="996.21" data-end="999.24">API locks the coordinate system of the real world</span> <span data-start="999.24" data-end="1000.74">to the virtual world.</span> <span data-start="1000.74" data-end="1002.3">And what that means is that, one,</span> <span data-start="1002.3" data-end="1005.24">in WebGL or the virtual space or in three,</span> <span data-start="1005.24" data-end="1007.37">one unit is one meter in the real world.</span> <span data-start="1007.37" data-end="1009.06">10 units is 10 meters.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1009.06" data-end="1011.87">So in this case, if our mesh is half a unit wide,</span> <span data-start="1011.87" data-end="1015.92">it means it'll appear as half a meter in the real world.</span> <span data-start="1015.92" data-end="1017.42">Next, what we're going to want to do</span> <span data-start="1017.42" data-end="1020.03">is actually render the reticle over the camera</span> <span data-start="1020.03" data-end="1021.77">on real-world geometry.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1021.77" data-end="1023.99">But to do that, we need to know where the real world</span> <span data-start="1023.99" data-end="1025.579">geometry is.</span> <span data-start="1025.579" data-end="1028.339">The WebXR device API includes the capability</span> <span data-start="1028.339" data-end="1030.21">to do a hit test, which is firing</span> <span data-start="1030.21" data-end="1033.079">a ray into the real world and getting intersection</span> <span data-start="1033.079" data-end="1035.52">points with real-world surfaces, so, for example,</span> <span data-start="1035.52" data-end="1037.994">taking a ray from my eye, down into the stage,</span> <span data-start="1037.994" data-end="1040.16">and then getting the intersection point of where I'm</span> <span data-start="1040.16" data-end="1042.74">looking on the stage, but also the normal facing up,</span> <span data-start="1042.74" data-end="1046.03">so I know where the surface is and what direction it's facing.</span> <span data-start="1046.03" data-end="1048.202">Now, in order to do that, you need a ray.</span> <span data-start="1048.202" data-end="1050.66">And a good example of some of the things three can help you</span> <span data-start="1050.66" data-end="1053.78">with is a ray caster function, which I don't show here.</span> <span data-start="1053.78" data-end="1056.36">But it will let you get the origin and the direction</span> <span data-start="1056.36" data-end="1057.86">of the ray that you're going to fire</span> <span data-start="1057.86" data-end="1059.339">into the scene from the camera.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1059.339" data-end="1060.63">So we've already got that here.</span> <span data-start="1060.63" data-end="1063.14">And what we're going to do is pass that into the hit test</span> <span data-start="1063.14" data-end="1065.891">API with WebXR.</span> <span data-start="1065.891" data-end="1068.14">And then what we'll do is we'll take the return value.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1068.14" data-end="1070.3">We'll actually possibly get a list of things,</span> <span data-start="1070.3" data-end="1072.28">because it might be more than one object</span> <span data-start="1072.28" data-end="1074.56">behind the first hit.</span> <span data-start="1074.56" data-end="1076.69">We'll take the first one, the closest,</span> <span data-start="1076.69" data-end="1079.21">and we'll convert the position that we</span> <span data-start="1079.21" data-end="1081.58">got into a three.js matrix, and then</span> <span data-start="1081.58" data-end="1083.769">we'll use that to set the position of the reticle.</span> <span data-start="1083.769" data-end="1085.06">And at that point, you're done.</span> <span data-start="1085.06" data-end="1087.85">The reticle is now positioned so that it will render directly</span> <span data-start="1087.85" data-end="1092.129">over the real-world object that was detected from that ray.</span> <span data-start="1092.129" data-end="1093.67">Now, it's worth reiterating that this</span> <span data-start="1093.67" data-end="1096.13">works because the virtual coordinate system matches</span> <span data-start="1096.13" data-end="1097.117">the real world one.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1097.117" data-end="1099.2">And obviously, I skipped over a lot of steps here,</span> <span data-start="1099.2" data-end="1101.491">but the point really is that you can combine frameworks</span> <span data-start="1101.491" data-end="1103.3">like three js with WebXR.</span> <span data-start="1103.3" data-end="1106.36">And it's fairly straightforward if you know 3D programming</span> <span data-start="1106.36" data-end="1108.54">basics.</span> <span data-start="1108.54" data-end="1112.77">But some of you might not know 3D programming basics.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1112.77" data-end="1114.27">And the fact is that if you've tried</span> <span data-start="1114.27" data-end="1117.09">to add a 3D model to your site, you probably</span> <span data-start="1117.09" data-end="1118.74">know already it's not super easy.</span> <span data-start="1118.74" data-end="1122.97">3D models can be pretty complex both to read and to display.</span> <span data-start="1122.97" data-end="1125.61">We saw that, even in the West Elm example,</span> <span data-start="1125.61" data-end="1127.435">there were user experience considerations.</span> <span data-start="1127.435" data-end="1129.81">If you're starting from scratch, you have to think about,</span> <span data-start="1129.81" data-end="1132.226">how do I want to rotate objects, allow people to move them</span> <span data-start="1132.226" data-end="1133.87">around, and so forth?</span> <span data-start="1133.87" data-end="1135.81">And then there's also responsive design.</span> <span data-start="1135.81" data-end="1138.944">If you want this to work on mobile and desktop,</span> <span data-start="1138.944" data-end="1140.61">even if you're just doing a simple model</span> <span data-start="1140.61" data-end="1144.18">and a turntable view, you have to know how to handle resizing.</span> <span data-start="1144.18" data-end="1146.5">Do you need to display a poster image on mobile</span> <span data-start="1146.5" data-end="1149.07">to prevent the download of the 3D geometry</span> <span data-start="1149.07" data-end="1151.26">until the user actually wants it?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1151.26" data-end="1154.08">For newer technology, like augmented reality,</span> <span data-start="1154.08" data-end="1156.75">ideally, you'd be able to take advantage and progressively</span> <span data-start="1156.75" data-end="1158.97">enhance and use some of the capabilities</span> <span data-start="1158.97" data-end="1160.8">on different platforms even if they're not</span> <span data-start="1160.8" data-end="1162.82">available in all browsers.</span> <span data-start="1162.82" data-end="1165.892">And as WebXR comes out and starts moving to stable,</span> <span data-start="1165.892" data-end="1167.1">it's one more thing to learn.</span> <span data-start="1167.1" data-end="1168.224">It's one more thing to add.</span> <span data-start="1168.224" data-end="1170.91">So just know that if you've experimented with this before</span> <span data-start="1170.91" data-end="1174.464">and you found it a little bit tricky, you're not alone.</span> <span data-start="1174.464" data-end="1176.88">So to that end, the team has been looking at this problem.</span> <span data-start="1176.88" data-end="1180.6">And we recently made public an early version of a 3D</span> <span data-start="1180.6" data-end="1182.22">model viewer web component.</span> <span data-start="1182.22" data-end="1183.857">This is really, really early, but it</span> <span data-start="1183.857" data-end="1186.19">does some things today to make life a little bit easier.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1186.19" data-end="1189.46">And the reason we released it early was to get your feedback.</span> <span data-start="1189.46" data-end="1191.46">To give you some context for this web component,</span> <span data-start="1191.46" data-end="1193.22">there's three things we're trying to do.</span> <span data-start="1193.22" data-end="1194.97">The first is we want you to be able to add</span> <span data-start="1194.97" data-end="1198.09">3D models to your site without having to learn 3D programming</span> <span data-start="1198.09" data-end="1199.96">or writing 3D code.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1199.96" data-end="1202.65">The second is we want it to work well and responsibly</span> <span data-start="1202.65" data-end="1204.93">across browsers and across different device form</span> <span data-start="1204.93" data-end="1207.03">factors with progressive enhancement</span> <span data-start="1207.03" data-end="1209.91">to take advantage of capabilities</span> <span data-start="1209.91" data-end="1212.02">on browsers where they're available.</span> <span data-start="1212.02" data-end="1213.99">And then the third goal is that as new API</span> <span data-start="1213.99" data-end="1215.959">ships, such as the WebXR device API,</span> <span data-start="1215.959" data-end="1218.25">we want the component to start taking advantage of them</span> <span data-start="1218.25" data-end="1219.624">so that you don't have to keep up</span> <span data-start="1219.624" data-end="1223.71">to date with all of the changes that are coming out.</span> <span data-start="1223.71" data-end="1225.502">So, like I said, it is super early,</span> <span data-start="1225.502" data-end="1226.71">but we've made some progress.</span> <span data-start="1226.71" data-end="1228.418">And so I want to give you a sense of what</span> <span data-start="1228.418" data-end="1229.58">the component can do today.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1229.58" data-end="1230.954">Let's run through a few examples.</span> <span data-start="1230.954" data-end="1233.46">And this is the first one, the simplest use case,</span> <span data-start="1233.46" data-end="1235.91">which is a static GLTF model.</span> <span data-start="1235.91" data-end="1239.45">For those who haven't heard GLTF before, it is a 3D file format,</span> <span data-start="1239.45" data-end="1242.27">and it is a required component of this model viewer</span> <span data-start="1242.27" data-end="1244.91">because it's a format that will allow us to work across all</span> <span data-start="1244.91" data-end="1247.507">of the different browsers.</span> <span data-start="1247.507" data-end="1249.84">Here, you can see that if we add a couple of attributes,</span> <span data-start="1249.84" data-end="1251.67">we can bring the model to life.</span> <span data-start="1251.67" data-end="1253.53">In this case, we set the background color,</span> <span data-start="1253.53" data-end="1255.48">and we set it to auto rotate.</span> <span data-start="1255.48" data-end="1256.98">With the controls attribute, we also</span> <span data-start="1256.98" data-end="1259.86">can allow the user to spin it around and move it and take</span> <span data-start="1259.86" data-end="1261.66">a look at what's going on, then look at it</span> <span data-start="1261.66" data-end="1264.58">from the back and the front.</span> <span data-start="1264.58" data-end="1267.12">We've also added a poster image capability.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1267.12" data-end="1269.43">And you could delay the loading of the model,</span> <span data-start="1269.43" data-end="1271.45">so you're not consuming data on mobile,</span> <span data-start="1271.45" data-end="1272.89">if that's what you want to do.</span> <span data-start="1272.89" data-end="1274.39">And the attributes are also dynamic.</span> <span data-start="1274.39" data-end="1276.681">So if you add a little script which switches the poster</span> <span data-start="1276.681" data-end="1278.94">image back and forth, you can animate it a little bit</span> <span data-start="1278.94" data-end="1281.7">to give the user a sense that it's not just another image.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1281.7" data-end="1283.86">It's actually a 3D model that they could click on.</span> <span data-start="1283.86" data-end="1287.95">It works in that way similar to an image tag.</span> <span data-start="1287.95" data-end="1290.84">The component also handles some forms of responsive design.</span> <span data-start="1290.84" data-end="1293.57">So you can see here that it will scale up for desktop</span> <span data-start="1293.57" data-end="1295.16">and it will scale down for mobile.</span> <span data-start="1295.16" data-end="1297.2">And it will manage the staging and the lighting</span> <span data-start="1297.2" data-end="1299.48">and the rendering of the model properly.</span> <span data-start="1299.48" data-end="1302.51">It can also manage multiple instances on the same page,</span> <span data-start="1302.51" data-end="1305.54">so it will take care of WebGL from that perspective.</span> <span data-start="1305.54" data-end="1307.46">And it uses IntersectionObserver to make</span> <span data-start="1307.46" data-end="1311.39">sure it's not burning battery and GPU when you can't actually</span> <span data-start="1311.39" data-end="1313.89">see the model.</span> <span data-start="1313.89" data-end="1316.04">Finally, the team is experimenting right now</span> <span data-start="1316.04" data-end="1317.915">with some of the more progressive enhancement</span> <span data-start="1317.915" data-end="1318.65">capabilities.</span> <span data-start="1318.65" data-end="1320.025">In this case, you can see they're</span> <span data-start="1320.025" data-end="1322.94">experimenting with the WebXR API and incorporating that,</span> <span data-start="1322.94" data-end="1326">so that you can add more attributes to turn on AR</span> <span data-start="1326" data-end="1330.6">and do that across different devices.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1330.6" data-end="1332.1">Again, this is really early.</span> <span data-start="1332.1" data-end="1333.87">The team is still working on more features</span> <span data-start="1333.87" data-end="1336.45">for user interface and responsive design features</span> <span data-start="1336.45" data-end="1338.95">to make it as easy as possible to add a 3D model to a web</span> <span data-start="1338.95" data-end="1339.75">page.</span> <span data-start="1339.75" data-end="1341.125">Looking forward, there's a lot we</span> <span data-start="1341.125" data-end="1343.29">can do on realism, augmented reality use cases,</span> <span data-start="1343.29" data-end="1344.34">interactivity.</span> <span data-start="1344.34" data-end="1345.96">The whole reason we made this public</span> <span data-start="1345.96" data-end="1347.62">is that we'd love you to try it out,</span> <span data-start="1347.62" data-end="1350.01">and we'd like to get your feedback in the GitHub.</span> <span data-start="1350.01" data-end="1352.45">So if this is something you're interested in,</span> <span data-start="1352.45" data-end="1354.33">please do go to the GitHub, take a look,</span> <span data-start="1354.33" data-end="1357.69">try it out, and then let us know what you think.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1357.69" data-end="1359.16">And with that, we're done.</span> <span data-start="1359.16" data-end="1362.55">So we covered today a little bit about the WebXR device API.</span> <span data-start="1362.55" data-end="1364.11">We talked about three.js.</span> <span data-start="1364.11" data-end="1368.74">And we touched briefly on this new early release of the model</span> <span data-start="1368.74" data-end="1370.044">viewer web component.</span> <span data-start="1370.044" data-end="1371.46">If you're interested in more, this</span> <span data-start="1371.46" data-end="1373.23">is the slide to take a picture of.</span> </p>
